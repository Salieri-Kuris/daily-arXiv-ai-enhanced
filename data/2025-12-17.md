Abstract: We study a nonreciprocal generalization [EPL 60, 418 (2002)] of the classical Heisenberg spin chain, in which the exchange coupling is nonsymmetric, and show that it displays a ballistic spreading of chaos as measured by the decorrelator. We show that the interactions are reciprocal in terms of transformed variables, with conserved quantities that can be identified as magnetization and energy, with a Poisson-bracket algebra and Hamiltonian dynamics. For strictly antisymmetric couplings in the original model the conserved quantities diffuse, the decorrelator spreads symmetrically, and a simple hydrodynamic theory emerges. The general case in which the interaction has symmetric and antisymmetric parts presents complexities in the limit of large scales. Ballistic propagation of chaos survives the inclusion of interactions beyond nearest neighbours, but the conservation laws in general do not.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a renormalization group (RG) approach to compare and collapse eigenvalue densities of random matrix models of complex systems across different system sizes. The approach is to fix a natural spectral scale by letting the model normalization run with size, turning raw spectra into comparable, collapsed density curves. We demonstrate this approach on generalizations of two classic random matrix ensembles--Wigner and Wishart--modified to have power-law variance profiles. We use random matrix theory methods to derive self-consistent fixed-point equations for the resolvent to compute their eigenvalue densities, we define an RG scheme based on matrix decimation, and compute the Beta function controlling the RG flow as a function of the variance profile power-law exponent. The running normalization leads to spectral collapse which we confirm in simulations and solutions of the fixed-point equations. We expect this RG approach to carry over to other ensembles, providing a method for data analysis of a broad range of complex systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We consider a binary system of particles with repulsive interactions that move in opposite or perpendicular directions to each other under an applied external drive. For opposite driving, at higher drives a phase-separated laned state forms that has strong hysteresis in the velocity-force curve and the fraction of topological defects as the drive is cycled up and down from zero. The amount of hysteresis depends on the drive value at which the drive changes from increasing to decreasing. For perpendicular driving, we find a jammed state that transitions into a disordered state or a tilted lane state, both of which also show strong hysteresis effects. Additionally, a negative drag effect can appear in which one species moves in the direction opposite to the other species due to a tilting of the lanes by the perpendicular drive. When a constant drive is applied along one direction while the drive in the perpendicular direction is increased, we observe a series of drops and jumps in the velocity as the system forms locked and tilted laned states. For weakly interacting particles, the jammed system can show co-tilted stripe-forming states.

TL;DR: An information-theoretic method quantifies historical dependencies in non-Markovian systems, showing invariant scaling across timescales and a peak in dependency strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of a general framework for quantifying historical dependencies in non-Markovian stochastic processes, especially in biological systems.

Method: An information-theoretic approach to decompose and quantify historical dependencies in non-Markovian dynamics.

Result: The framework accurately captures historical dependencies, revealing invariant scaling across timescales and non-monotonic information patterns in fly behavior.

Conclusion: The framework identifies a unique timescale where historical dependencies are strongest in non-Markovian systems.

Abstract: Non-Markovian stochastic processes are ubiquitous in biology. Nevertheless, we lack a general framework for quantifying historical dependencies. In this Letter, we propose an information-theoretic approach to decompose history dependence in systems with non-Markovian dynamics, quantifying the information encoded in dependencies of each order. In minimal models of non-Markovian dynamics, we show that this framework correctly captures the underlying historical dependencies, even when autocorrelations do not. In prolonged recordings of fly behavior, we find that the scaling of non-Markovian dependencies is invariant across timescales from fractions of a second to minutes. Despite this invariance, the overall amount of non-Markovian information is non-monotonic, suggesting a unique timescale on which historical dependencies are strongest.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics are ubiquitous across physics, biology, and engineering. Yet our understanding of non-Markovian processes significantly lags that of simpler Markovian processes, due largely to a lack of tractable models. In this article, we present a minimal model of non-Markovian dynamics in which the current state copies past states with arbitrary history dependence. We show that many properties of this process can be studied analytically, providing insight into the relationships between history dependence, autocorrelations, and information-theoretic metrics like entropy and dynamical information. Strikingly, we find that autocorrelations can fail, even qualitatively, to capture the underlying dependencies. Ultimately, this model serves as a tractable sandbox for exploring non-Markovian dynamics.

### [7] [Age-structured hydrodynamics of ensembles of anomalously diffusing particles with renewal resetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14345)
*Baruch Meerson,Ohad Vilk*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: A hydrodynamic theory for anomalously diffusing particles under resetting reveals distinct steady-state densities for different protocols, highlighting global correlations and compact supports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To describe the collective behavior of a large number of anomalously diffusing particles under stochastic renewal resetting and to analyze the steady-state densities for different resetting protocols.

Method: The theory treats the age of a particle as a dynamical variable and incorporates resetting rules that introduce global inter-particle correlations. It models anomalous diffusion using scaled Brownian motion (sBm).

Result: Non-equilibrium steady states are achieved in all three resetting protocols (independent resetting, resetting of the farthest particle, and scaled Brownian bees). The steady-state densities differ significantly between models, with compact supports for model B and the scaled Brownian bees.

Conclusion: The age-structured hydrodynamic theory can be extended to other anomalous diffusion processes with renewal resetting protocols, offering a versatile framework for studying collective behavior in complex systems.

Abstract: We develop an age-structured hydrodynamic (HD) theory which describes the collective behavior of $N\gg 1$ anomalously diffusing particles under stochastic renewal resetting. The theory treats the age of a particle -- the time since its last reset -- as an explicit dynamical variable and allows for resetting rules which introduce global inter-particle correlations. The anomalous diffusion is modeled by the scaled Brownian motion (sBm): a Gaussian process with independent increments, characterized by a power-law time dependence of the diffusion coefficient, $D(t)\sim t^{2H-1}$, where $H>0$. We apply this theory to three different resetting protocols: independent resetting to the origin (model~A), resetting to the origin of the particle farthest from it (model~B), and a scaled-diffusion extension of the ``Brownian bees" model of Berestycki et al, Ann. Probab. \textbf{50}, 2133 (2022). In all these models non-equilibrium steady states are reached at long times, and we determine the steady-state densities. For model A the (normalized to unity) steady-state density coincides with the steady-state probability density of a single particle undergoing sBM with resetting to the origin. For model B, and for the scaled Brownian bees, the HD steady-state densities are markedly different: in particular, they have compact supports for all $H>0$. The age-structured HD formalism can be extended to other anomalous diffusion processes with renewal resetting protocols which introduce global inter-particle correlations.

*Yu. Kozitsky*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Yukhnovskii's layer-by-layer integration method for the 3D Ising model offered insights comparable to the ε-expansion, fitting into the broader development of quantum field theory and statistical physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To present Yukhnovskii's work in the broader context of quantum field theory and statistical physics, highlighting its significance beyond its initial perception.

Method: layer-by-layer integration in the space of collective variables

Result: Yukhnovskii's technique yielded results similar to the ε-expansion method but provided deeper understanding of the critical phenomenon.

Conclusion: Yukhnovskii's theory not only provided an alternative method to study the critical point of the three-dimensional Ising model but also contributed significantly to the broader context of quantum field theory and statistical physics in the late 20th century, offering deeper insights into the phenomenon.

Abstract: Half a century ago, Ihor Yukhnovskii elaborated a method of studying the critical point of the three-dimensional Ising model based on a layer-by-layer integration in the space of collective variables. His method was an alternative to that based on the $\varepsilon$-expansion for which K. G. Wilson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1982. However, Yukhnovskii's technique, which yielded similar results, provided even deeper insight into the nature of this phenomenon. At that time, we, professor's students, saw only this aspect of his theory. Later, I realized that the mentioned Yukhnovskii's work naturally fits into a more general context of the turbulent development of quantum field theory and statistical physics in the last quarter of the twentieth century. The aim of the present article is to look at the main aspects and the impact of Yukhnovskii's theory from this perspective.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A third monolayer of tin atoms on the semiconductor substrate Si(111) has been shown to become superconducting upon six to ten percent hole doping. Experiments have reported promising results hinting at a superconducting chiral $d$-wave order parameter. Here we examine Sn/Si(111) by combining most recent ab initio results, quasi-particle interference calculations, state-of-the-art truncated-unity functional renormalization group simulations and Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis. We show remarkable agreement between experimental and theoretical quasi-particle interference data both in the metallic and superconducting regimes. The interacting phase diagram reveals that the superconductivity is indeed chiral $d$-wave with Chern number $C=4$. Surprisingly, magnetically ordered phases are absent, instead we find charge density wave order, as observed in related compounds, as a competing phase. Our results demonstrate that Sn/Si(111) is an outstanding candidate material for chiral topological superconductivity.

Abstract: One of the recurring hurdles in studying unconventional superconductivity is the challenge of efficiently and conclusively identifying the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in a new material. Uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$) exhibits an unprecedented number of superconducting phases as a function of pressure and magnetic field, each presumably characterized by a different symmetry of the superconducting gap function. None of these phases has had its symmetry conclusively identified so far. In this article, we report results of an extensive study of the thermal conductivity of UTe$_2$ in its low-field, low-temperature superconducting state as a function of the angle of an applied magnetic field rotated in the $b$-$c$ plane. We observe clear and substantial oscillations in the thermal conductivity as a function of field angle, which naturally suggests the existence of point nodes in the gap. Utilizing the experimentally determined Fermi surface, we are able to model this phenomenon for all the potential gap structures in UTe$_2$ and positively identify the location of these nodes as being along the crystallographic $b$-axis, implying that the superconducting order parameter belongs to the $B_{2u}$ irreducible representation of the crystal point group. The clarity of this result will accelerate the identification of other superconducting phases in UTe$_2$, and guide future studies through the use of high resolution field-angle-dependent measurements.

Abstract: Muon spin rotation ($μ$SR) measurements of internal magnetic field shifts, known as the muon Knight shift, is used for determining pairing symmetries in superconductors. While this technique has been especially effective for $f$-electron-based heavy-fermion superconductors, it remains challenging in $d$-electron-based superconductors such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where the Knight shift is intrinsically small. Here, we report high-precision muon Knight shift measurements of superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. We observe that using multiple pieces of crystals, a common practice in $μ$SR measurements, induces a substantial paramagnetic shift below the superconducting transition temperature, $T_c$, when a weak magnetic field is applied. We attribute such an unresolved paramagnetic shift to stray fields generated by neighboring diamagnetic crystals. To avoid this, one piece of crystal was used in this study. We experimentally determine the muon Knight shift of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in the normal state to be -116$\pm$7 ppm. By combining the observed muon Knight shift with independently determined bulk magnetization data from the same crystal used in $μ$SR and carefully separating various contributions to the shift, we confirm a significant reduction in the spin Knight shift below $T_c$, consistent with spin-singlet-like pairing. This result constitutes the precise muon Knight shift measurement in a $d$-electron-based superconductor. Our results highlight the potential of $μ$SR as a powerful complementary technique to the established method of nuclear magnetic resonance for probing the spin susceptibility in superconductors.

Abstract: We study anisotropic superconductivity in the nearly quarter-filled $α$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice. We analyze an extended Hubbard model with off-site attractive interactions within the mean-field framework and find two distinct chiral $d+id'$-wave superconducting phases characterized by different Chern numbers. We further investigate the superconducting mechanism mediated by spin fluctuations arising from purely repulsive interactions by applying the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation to the Hubbard model. The gap symmetry obtained by solving the linearized Eliashberg equation is $d$-wave, which corresponds to a $d+id'$-wave superconducting state with a Chern number of $8$, including the spin degree of freedom. The $\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{0}$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation, which possesses the largest spectral weight at finite energies arising from the incipient flat band, gives rise to an effective spin-singlet pairing glue between rim sites.

Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in both bulk and thin-film bilayer nickelates has garnered significant attention. In this study, inspired by recent STM experiments on thin films, we investigate the quasiparticle interference (QPI) characteristics of bilayer nickelates in both normal and superconducting states to identify their Fermiology and pairing symmetry. We demonstrate that the mirror symmetry inherent in the bilayer structure induces mirror-selective quasiparticle scattering by establishing selection rules based on the mirror properties of impurities and the mirror eigenvalues of electronic wavefunctions. This mirror-selective scattering allows for the differentiation of distinct Fermiologies, as QPI patterns vary markedly between scenarios with and without the $d_{z^2}$-bonding Fermi surface (FS). Furthermore, it enables the separate detection of sign changes in superconducting gaps both within the same FS and between different FSs. Crucially, if the mirror-symmetry-enforced selection rules are ignored, the QPI response of an $s_\pm$-wave state can masquerade as that of a conventional $s$-wave state, leading to a misidentification of the pairing symmetry. When combined with field-dependent and reference QPI measurements, this approach facilitates the precise determination of pairing symmetry, even in the presence of FS-dependent gaps and gap anisotropy. Additionally, we discuss practical considerations for STM measurements to effectively identify the pairing symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that mirror-selective QPI is a powerful tool for distinguishing between different Fermiologies and pairing states, which is helpful in pinning down pairing symmetry and revealing the pairing mechanism in bilayer nickelates.

### [14] [Electron-positron pair creation induced by multi-pulse train of electric fields: effect of randomness in time-delay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13722)
*Deepak Sah,Manoranjan P. Singh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Stochastic time delays in electric pulse trains enhance electron-positron pair creation, modulating the momentum spectrum and boosting the central peak.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of stochastic time delays in pulse trains on the momentum spectrum and electron-positron pair creation efficiency.

Method: Solving the quantum Vlasov equations for electron-positron pair creation in alternating-sign electric field pulse trains with random time delays drawn from a Gaussian distribution.

Result: Increasing the standard deviation of time delays transforms the momentum spectrum, enhancing the central peak significantly (e.g., a tenfold increase for certain parameters).

Conclusion: Stochastic time delays in Sauter-like pulse trains can enhance the central peak of the electron-positron pair distribution, potentially optimizing multi-pulse field configurations for future experiments.

Abstract: We investigate the creation of electron-positron pairs (EPPs) in a sequence of alternating-sign, time-dependent electric field pulse trains by solving the quantum Vlasov equations. Specifically, we focus on Sauter-like pulse trains with random time delays between successive pulses, drawn from a Gaussian distribution wherein the extent of fluctuations is controlled by the standard deviation $σ_T$ of the distribution. We find that increasing $σ_T$ leads to a dramatic transformation in the longitudinal momentum spectrum. The well-known fringe pattern, akin to that in the multi-slit interference, gets significantly modified. The averaged spectra exhibit a robust Gaussian-like envelope with residual oscillations, which are much more prominent in the central momentum region. Notably, we find that in certain cases, stochastic time delays lead to a pronounced enhancement in the central peak of the distribution function for pulse train containing $N$ pulses. For example, for $N=20$ pulses, $σ_T \approx 31$ $[m^{-1}]$(about $17\%$ of the mean time delay) yields nearly a tenfold increase in the central peak, which for $σ_T \approx 50$ $[m^{-1}]$ (about $27\%$ of the mean time delay), scales up to $10^3.$ This may open up new possibilities for optimizing multi-pulse field configurations and guide future experimental designs aimed at maximizing EPPs creation.

Abstract: We propose a Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Quantum Graph Convolutional Network (H-STQGCN) algorithm by combining the strengths of quantum computing and classical deep learning to predict the taxi destination within urban road networks. Our algorithm consists of two branches: spatial processing and time evolution. Regarding the spatial processing, the classical module encodes the local topological features of the road network based on the GCN method, and the quantum module is designed to map graph features onto parameterized quantum circuits through a differentiable pooling layer. The time evolution is solved by integrating multi-source contextual information and capturing dynamic trip dependencies on the classical TCN theory. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current methods in terms of prediction accuracy and stability, validating the unique advantages of the quantum-enhanced mechanism in capturing high-dimensional spatial dependencies.

Result: We show how a Trotterization scheme can densify disorder, and study its effects on time evolution, dynamical observables, quantum chaos probes, and coupling distributions.

Conclusion: We conclude this work with a detailed investigation of the robustness of our findings against dissipation, both analytically and numerically.

Abstract: All-to-all interacting and disordered many-body systems are notoriously hard to simulate on quantum platforms, as interactions are commonly mediated by auxiliary degrees of freedom that lower the amount of disorder, introducing undesired correlations. In this work, we show how a Trotterization scheme can be effectively utilized to densify the disorder of the model. In particular, we study the statistical properties of the resulting model, as well as Trotterization errors in the simulation that affect the time evolution and dynamical observables. As a concrete example, we propose an implementation via a single-mode cavity QED platform of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. We analyze several features of the effective model, such as the distribution of the effective couplings, the number of interacting sites, state preparation, and the behavior of quantum chaos probes. We conclude this work with a detailed investigation of the robustness of our findings against dissipation, both analytically and numerically.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 2D transversal phase gate implementation using non-Abelian surface codes, bypassing the Bravyi-König theorem to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation with non-Abelian groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations imposed by the Bravyi-König theorem on the implementation of unitary gates in Pauli stabilizer codes and achieve transversal gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy in 2D.

Method: The method involves encoding a logical qubit in the quantum double of a non-Abelian group on a triangular spatial patch and using a symmetry-protected topological phase to implement transversal gates.

Result: The construction realizes the phase gate T^(1/N) in the logical Z basis for the dihedral group D_{4N}, which lies at the n-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and can be implemented with qubit-only stabilizers.

Conclusion: The paper presents a 2D transversal realization of phase gates using non-Abelian surface codes, bypassing the Bravyi-König theorem's limitations and enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation with non-Abelian groups.

Abstract: We present a purely 2D transversal realization of phase gates at any level of the Clifford hierarchy, and beyond, using non-Abelian surface codes. Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--König theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, however at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{iπ/(4N)})$ in the logical $\overline{Z}$ basis. For $8N = 2^n$, this gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice. We also discuss code-switching to the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric codes, which can be utilized for the quantum error correction in this setup.

Abstract: Zoned neutral atom architectures are emerging as a promising platform for large-scale quantum computing. Their growing scale, however, creates a critical need for efficient and automated compilation solutions. Yet, existing methods fail to scale to the thousands of qubits these devices promise. State-of-the-art compilers, in particular, suffer from immense memory requirements that limit them to small-scale problems. This work proposes a scalable compilation strategy that "searches smarter, not harder". We introduce Iterative Diving Search (IDS), a goal-directed search algorithm that avoids the memory issues of previous methods, and relaxed routing, an optimization to mitigate atom rearrangement overhead. Our evaluation confirms that this approach compiles circuits with thousands of qubits and, in addition, even reduces rearrangement overhead by 28.1% on average. The complete code is publicly available in open-source as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qmap.

Abstract: Free probability provides a framework for describing correlations between non-commuting observables in complex quantum systems whose Hilbert-space states follow maximum-entropy distributions. We examine the robustness of this framework under a minimal deviation from freeness: the coupling of a single ancilla qubit to a Haar-distributed quantum circuit of dimension $D0 \gg 1$. We find that, even in this setting, the correlation functions predicted by free probability theory receive corrections of order $O(1)$. These modifications persist at long times, when the dynamics of the coupled system is already ergodic. We trace their origin to non-uniformly distributed stationary quantum states, which we characterize analytically and confirm numerically.

Abstract: We study the statistics of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) after partial measurement on a class of one-dimensional quantum critical states described by Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids at low energies. Using a replica trick to average over measurement outcomes in the charge basis and tools from conformal field theory (CFT), we derive closed-form expressions for the cumulants of MIE. We show that exact Born-averaging over microscopic measurement outcomes becomes equivalent at low energy to averaging over conformal boundary conditions weighted by their corresponding partition functions. Our results yield distinctive critical behavior across all cumulants in the regime where the unmeasured parts of the system are maximally separated. We also obtain the full distribution of the post-measurement entanglement entropy, finding that it is generically bimodal and exhibits fat-tails. We corroborate our analytical predictions by numerical calculations and find good agreement between them.

Abstract: We find that when the environment of a two-level system has an energy spectrum with a lower bound but without an upper one, the survival probability of the spontaneous emission of the two-level system scales with the spatial dimension $D$ and the exponent $n$ of the energy dispersion $|\vec{k}|^n$ of the environment in the form $1-αt^{2-D/n}$ in the short-time and in the form $αt^{D/n-2}$ in the long-time regime. The former fractional scaling of the survival probability leads to a quantum Zeno effect with a different scaling of the Zeno time.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the link budget for free-space optical systems involving Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites. We develop a detailed model of the satellite-to-ground channel that accounts for the primary physical processes affecting transmittance: atmospheric absorption and scattering, free-space diffraction, and turbulence-induced fluctuations. The study introduces a general method for computing transmittance along a slant path between a satellite and an optical ground station, incorporating zenith angle, slant range, and altitude-dependent attenuation. The proposed framework is intended to support the design and evaluation of space-based optical links and serves as a critical tool for defining technical specifications in satellite communication demonstrators and simulations. Numerical estimates are provided to illustrate the magnitude of losses under typical operational conditions, including the role of aperture averaging. In addition to the link budget analysis, we introduce a satellite-based quantum use case. We propose a scheme for quantum state tomography performed on states generated by an onboard photon source on an LEO or MEO satellite and transmitted to the optical ground station. This approach enables continuous verification of the quality of quantum resources that can be used to perform quantum protocols within quantum information networks.

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond provide a solid-state platform for quantum sensing. While optically detected magnetic resonance techniques offer high sensitivity, their reliance on microwaves introduces heating and stray electromagnetic fields that can perturb nearby samples. Optical approaches based on cross-relaxation between differently oriented NV centers remove this constraint but have so far required stringent alignment of the external field with crystallographic axes, restricting their practicality. Here we introduce a general framework for microwave-free vector magnetometry at near-zero field that leverages Bayesian inference to extract both the magnetic field vector and the NV orientation directly from photoluminescence maps. An analytical model of cross-relaxation resonances enables efficient inference under arbitrary field and orientation configurations, while naturally incorporating the discrete degeneracies of the NV symmetry. We experimentally demonstrate robust orientation determination and vector-field reconstruction, establishing a general route toward compact and alignment-free NV magnetometers for practical sensing applications.

Abstract: Holographic beam shaping is a powerful approach for generating individually addressable optical spots for controlling atomic qubits, such as those in trapped-ion quantum processors. However, its application in qubit control is limited by residual intensity crosstalk at neighboring sites and by a nonzero background floor in the far wings of the addressing beam, leading to accumulated errors from many exposed qubits. Here, we present an all-optical scheme that mitigates both effects using a single digital micromirror device (DMD) operated in a double-pass configuration, in which light interacts with two separate regions of the same device. In the first pass, one region of the DMD is placed in a Fourier plane and implements a binary-amplitude hologram for individual addressing, while in the second pass a different region serves as a programmable intermediate image-plane aperture for spatial filtering. By multiplexing the Fourier-plane hologram to include secondary holograms, we generate weak auxiliary fields that interfere destructively with unwanted light at selected sites, while image-plane filtering suppresses the residual tail at larger distances. Together, these techniques maintain relative intensity crosstalk at or below $10^{-5}$ ($-50\,\mathrm{dB}$) across the full field of view relevant for qubit addressing, and further reduce the far-wing background to approximately $10^{-6}$ at large distances from the addressed qubit, approaching the detection limit. These results provide a compact, DMD-based solution for low-crosstalk optical holographic qubit addressing that is directly applicable to trapped ions and other spatially ordered quantum systems.

Abstract: The Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism recasts classical mechanics in a Hilbert space framework using complex wavefunctions and linear operators, akin to quantum mechanics. Instead of evolving probability densities in phase space (as in Liouville's equation), KvN uses a Schrödinger-like equation for a classical wavefunction, with commuting position and momentum operators. Mapped to quantum computing, KvN offers a promising route to simulate classical dynamical systems using quantum algorithms by leveraging unitary evolution and quantum linear algebra tools, potentially enabling efficient classical-to-quantum mappings without invoking full quantum uncertainty. In this work, we specifically explore the implementation of the KvN approach on continuous-variable photonic quantum computing architectures, with the goals of leveraging quantum simulation for both sampling and computing intractable nonlinear dynamics. We will demonstrate its implementation and feasibility with two problems: the harmonic oscillator and a 1D partial differential equation governing nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: The emerging field of quantum thermodynamics is beginning to reveal the intriguing role that information can play in quantum thermal engines. Information enters as a resource when considering feedback-controlled thermal machines. While both a general theory of quantum feedback control as well as specific examples of quantum feedback-controlled engines have been presented, still lacking is a general framework for such machines. Here, we present a framework for a generic, two-stroke quantum heat engine interacting with $N$ thermal baths and Maxwell's demon. The demon performs projective measurements on the engine working substance, the outcome of which is recorded in a classical memory, embedded in its own thermal bath. To perform feedback control, the demon enacts unitary operations on the working substance, conditioned on the recorded outcome. By considering the compound machine-memory as a hybrid (classical-quantum) standard thermal machine interacting with $N+1$ thermal baths, our framework puts the working substance and memory on equal footing, thereby enabling a comprehensible resolution to Maxwell's paradox. We illustrate the application of our framework with a two-qubit engine. A remarkable observation is that more information does not necessarily result in better thermodynamic performance: sometimes knowing less is better.

Abstract: Dynamical decoupling seeks to mitigate phase decoherence in qubits by applying a carefully designed sequence of effectively instantaneous electromagnetic pulses. Although analytic solutions exist for pulse timings that are optimal under specific noise regimes, identifying the optimal timings for a realistic noise spectrum remains challenging. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for designing pulse sequences on qubits. Our novel action set enables the RL agent to efficiently navigate this inherently non-convex optimization landscape. The action set, derived from Thompson's group $F$, is applicable to a broad class of sequential decision problems whose states can be represented as bounded sequences. We demonstrate that our RL agent can learn pulse sequences that minimize dephasing without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying noise spectrum. This work opens the possibility for real-time learning of optimal dynamical decoupling sequences on qubits which are dephasing-limited. The model-free nature of our algorithm suggests that the agent may ultimately learn optimal pulse sequences even in the presence of unmodeled physical effects, such as pulse errors or non-Gaussian noise.

Abstract: This work introduces a symplectic framework for quantum error correcting codes in which local structure is analyzed through an anticode perspective. In this setting, a code is treated as a symplectic space, and anticodes arise as maximal symplectic subspaces whose elements vanish on a prescribed set of components, providing a natural quantum analogue of their classical counterparts. This framework encompasses several families of quantum codes, including stabilizer and subsystem codes, provides a natural extension of generalized distances in quantum codes, and yields new invariants that capture local algebraic and combinatorial features. The notion of anticodes also naturally leads to operations such as puncturing and shortening for symplectic codes, which in turn provide algebraic interpretations of key phenomena in quantum error correction, such as the cleaning lemma and complementary recovery and yield new descriptions of weight enumerators.

Abstract: Time--convolutionless (TCL) master equations can break down at long times: time-local perturbative generators develop secular growth in correlation-dominated regimes. We mitigate this by a regulated, partially resummed reconstruction of the dynamical map around a Davies reference semigroup, expressed through a non--Markovian density-matrix correlator C(t) that remains bounded at late times. An exactly solvable rotating-wave benchmark links generator growth to interference-induced near-zeros of the coherence and shows how the reconstruction regulates the map. Applying the method to the unbiased spin--boson model reveals an emergent transverse measurement primitive: bath memory and counter--rotating terms induce phase lock-in that irreversibly erases the relative phase between $σ_x$ eigenspaces on a finite timescale $t_P$, yielding an effective zero-bias transverse ($σ_x$) measurement channel. The selected transverse basis is not assumed a priori; it follows from the reconstructed reduced dynamics. The effect disappears in the rotating-wave approximation and in the Davies weak-coupling limit, demonstrating its non--Markovian interference origin.

Abstract: Quantum information processing and computation requires high accuracy qubit configuration readout. In many practical schemes, the initial qubit configuration has to be inferred from readout that is a time-dependent weak measurement record. However, a combination of the measurement scheme and intrinsic dynamics can end up scrambling the initial state and lose information irretrievably. Here, we study the information physics of quantum trajectories based on weak measurements in order to address the optimal achievable performance in qubit configuration readout for two realistic models of single qubit readout: (i) Model I is informationally complete, but without intrinsic dynamics; (ii) Model II is informationally incomplete weak measurements with intrinsic dynamics. We first use mutual information to characterize how much intrinsic information about the initial state is encoded in the measurement record. Using a fixed discrete time-step formulation, we compute the mutual information while varying the measurement strength, duration of measurement record, and the relative strength of intrinsic dynamics in our measurement schemes. We also exploit the emergence of continuum scaling and the Stochastic Master Equation in the weak measurement limit. We develop an asymptotic expansion in the measurement efficiency parameter to calculate mutual information, which captures qualitative and quantitative features of the numerical data. The bounds on information extraction are manifested as plateaux in mutual information, our analysis obtains these bounds and also optimal duration of measurement required to saturate them. Our results should be useful both for quantum device operation and optimization and also, possibly, for improving the performance of recent machine learning approaches for qubit and multiqubit configuration readout in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) experiment regimes.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires a universal gate set, but the necessary non-Clifford gates represent a significant resource cost for most quantum error correction architectures. Magic state cultivation offers an efficient alternative to resource-intensive distillation protocols; however, testing the proposal's assumptions represents a challenging departure from quantum memory experiments. We present an experimental study of magic state cultivation on a superconducting quantum processor. We implement cultivation, including code-switching into a surface code, and develop a fault-tolerant measurement protocol to bound the magic state fidelity. Cultivation reduces the error by a factor of 40, with a state fidelity of 0.9999(1) (retaining 8% of attempts). Our results experimentally establish magic state cultivation as a viable solution to one of quantum computing's most significant challenges.

Abstract: The anisotropic Rabi model (ARM), which features tunable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) and anti-Jaynes-Cummings (AJC) interactions, has remained challenging to realize fully. We present a circuit QED implementation that provides static control over the ARM parameters. By simultaneously coupling a qubit to a resonator's voltage and current antinodes, we geometrically tune the interaction from pure JC to pure AJC. This control enables novel quantum measurement capabilities, including dispersive shift cancellation and Purcell-suppressed readout. Our work establishes a direct platform for exploring the ARM's full parameter space and its applications in quantum information processing.

Abstract: Extreme heterogeneity in emerging HPC systems are starting to include quantum accelerators, motivating runtimes that can coordinate between classical and quantum workloads. We present a proof-of-concept hybrid execution framework integrating the IRIS asynchronous task-based runtime with the XACC quantum programming framework via the Quantum Intermediate Representation Execution Engine (QIR-EE). IRIS orchestrates multiple programs written in the quantum intermediate representation (QIR) across heterogeneous backends (including multiple quantum simulators), enabling concurrent execution of classical and quantum tasks. Although not a performance study, we report measurable outcomes through the successful asynchronous scheduling and execution of multiple quantum workloads. To illustrate practical runtime implications, we decompose a four-qubit circuit into smaller subcircuits through a process known as quantum circuit cutting, reducing per-task quantum simulation load and demonstrating how task granularity can improve simulator throughput and reduce queueing behavior -- effects directly relevant to early quantum hardware environments. We conclude by outlining key challenges for scaling hybrid runtimes, including coordinated scheduling, classical-quantum interaction management, and support for diverse backend resources in heterogeneous systems.

Abstract: Reliable charging protocols are crucial for advancing quantum batteries toward practical use. We investigate a transverse-field Ising chain as a quantum battery, focusing on the combined role of qubit interactions in the battery model and finite charging time. This interplay yields smoother and more controllable charging compared to sudden protocols or non-interacting batteries. Introducing stochastic noise reveals a strong dependence on the charging trajectory. Protocols that weakly excite the system gain energy under noise but lose extractable work. In contrast, protocols that strongly excite many modes show the opposite trend: noise reduces stored energy yet improves efficiency, defined as the ratio of ergotropy to stored energy. These findings demonstrate that finite-time ramps stabilize charging and highlight that noise can either hinder or enhance quantum-battery performance depending on the protocol.

Abstract: Readout error models for noisy quantum devices almost universally assume that measurement noise is classical: the measurement statistics are obtained from the ideal computational-basis populations by a column-stochastic assignment matrix $A$. This description is equivalent to assuming that the effective positive-operator-valued measurement (POVM) is diagonal in the measurement basis, and therefore completely insensitive to quantum coherences. We relax this assumption and derive a fully general expression for the observed measurement probabilities under arbitrary completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) noise preceding a computational-basis measurement. Writing the ideal post-circuit stat $\tildeρ$ in terms of its populations $x$ and coherences $y$, we show that the observed probability vector $z$ satisfies $z = A x + C y$, where $A$ is the familiar classical assignment matrix and $C$ is a coherence-response matrix constructed from the off-diagonal matrix elements of the effective POVM in the computational basis. The classical model $z = A x$ arises if and only if all POVM elements are diagonal; in this sense $C$ quantifies accessible information about coherent readout distortions and interference between computational-basis states, all of which are invisible to models that retain only $A$. This work therefore provides a natural, fully general framework for coherence-sensitive readout modeling on current and future quantum devices.

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is a key resource for quantum technologies, yet its scalable generation in noisy quantum devices remains challenging. Here, we propose a low-depth quantum neural network architecture with linear scaling, inspired by memory-enabled photonic components, for variational entanglement engineering. The network incorporates physically motivated non-linear activation functions, enhancing expressivity beyond linear variational circuits at fixed depth. By Monte Carlo sampling over circuit topologies, we identify architectures that efficiently generate highly entangled pure states, approaching the GHz limit, and demonstrate a clear advantage of non-linear networks up to 20 qubits. For the noisy scenario, we employ the experimentally accessible Meyer-Wallach global entanglement as a surrogate optimization cost and certify entanglement using bipartite negativity. For mixed states of up to ten qubits, the optimized circuits generate substantial entanglement across both symmetric and asymmetric bipartitions. These results establish an experimentally motivated and scalable variational framework for engineering multipartite entanglement on near-term quantum devices, highlighting the combined role of non-linearity and circuit topology.

Abstract: Optically-active solid-state systems such as self-assembled quantum dots, rare-earth ions, and color centers in diamond and SiC are promising candidates for quantum network, computing, and sensing applications. Although the nuclei in these systems naturally lead to electron spin decoherence, they can be repurposed, if they are controllable, as long-lived quantum memories. Prior work showed that a metric known as the one-tangling power can be used to quantify the entanglement dynamics of sparse systems of spin-1/2 nuclei coupled to color centers in diamond and SiC. Here, we generalize these findings to a wide range of electron-nuclear central-spin systems, including those with spin > 1/2 nuclei, such as in III-V quantum dots (QDs), rare-earth ions, and some color centers. Focusing on the example of an (In)GaAs QD, we offer a procedure for pinpointing physically realistic parameter regimes that yield maximal entanglement between the central electron and surrounding nuclei. We further harness knowledge of naturally-occurring degeneracies and the tunability of the system to generate maximal entanglement between target subsets of spins when the QD electron is subject to dynamical decoupling. We also leverage the one-tangling power as an exact and immediate method for computing QD electron spin dephasing times with and without the application of spin echo sequences, and use our analysis to identify coherence-sustaining conditions within the system.

Abstract: Unraveling the mechanisms of ergodicity breaking in complex quantum systems is a central pursuit in nonequilibrium physics. In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional spin model featuring a tunable long-range hopping term, $H_{n}$, which introduces nonlocal interactions and bridges the gap between Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. Through a systematic analysis of level-spacing statistics, Krylov complexity, and entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that $H_{n}$ acts as a universal control parameter driving the transition from integrability to quantum chaos. Specifically, increasing the strength of $H_{n}$ induces a crossover from Poissonian to Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble statistics in the Hermitian limit, and similarly triggers chaotic dynamics in the non-Hermitian case. Most remarkably, despite the onset of global chaos, we identify a tower of exact nonthermal eigenstates that evade thermalization. These states survive as robust quantum many-body scars, retaining low entanglement and coherent dynamics even under strong non-Hermitian perturbations. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which long-range and non-Hermitian effects reshape quantum ergodicity, offering new pathways for preserving quantum coherence in complex many-body systems.

Result: The FGS algorithm's sampling error is independent of the semiclassical parameter and eliminates boundary-induced instabilities, enabling accurate long-time simulations.

Conclusion: The FGS algorithm is a powerful tool for exploring long-time behavior of open quantum systems, providing numerical evidence for steady states in strongly non-harmonic potentials.

Abstract: Simulating Markovian open quantum systems in the semiclassical regime poses a grand challenge for computational physics, as the highly oscillatory nature of the dynamics imposes prohibitive resolution requirements on traditional grid-based methods. To overcome this barrier, this paper introduces an efficient Frozen Gaussian Sampling (FGS) algorithm based on the Wigner-Fokker-Planck phase-space formulation. The proposed algorithm exhibits two transformative advantages. First, for the computation of physical observables, its sampling error is independent of the semiclassical parameter $\varepsilon$, thus fundamentally breaking the prohibitive computational scaling faced by grid methods in the semiclassical limit. Second, its mesh-free nature entirely eliminates the boundary-induced instabilities that constrain long-time grid-based simulations. Leveraging these capabilities, the FGS algorithm serves as a powerful investigatory tool for exploring the long-time behavior of open quantum systems. Specifically, we provide compelling numerical evidence for the existence of steady states in strongly non-harmonic potentials-a regime where rigorous analytical results are currently lacking.

Abstract: Few, if any, applications of quantum technology are as widely known as the quantum simulation of quantum matter. Consequently, many interesting questions have been sparked at the intersection of condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and quantum computing. Given the common mathematical foundation of these subjects, we walk through the necessary group theory and representation theory serving as background in all of these fields. Our discussion will include a full development of the mathematics of identical particles and the mechanics of describing systems of identical particles in both first and second quantization schemes. This chapter is an offshoot of a larger work that provides a graduate-level introduction to quantum information science. This chapter is being released separately because it is not explicitly focused on quantum information. It has grown beyond a short digression into a full-fledged journey into the symmetries and representations of identical particles that we invite you, the reader, to join.

TL;DR: QBism's tenets focus on subjective probabilities and personal experiences, contrasting with other quantum interpretations and addressing key theoretical challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight QBism's unique approach to quantum theory by focusing on subjective probabilities and personal experiences, and to compare it with other interpretations.

Method: Exploring QBism's three tenets to analyze its implications and contrasts with other quantum interpretations.

Result: Clarifies how QBism contrasts with Bohr's, Everett's interpretations, and addresses Bell inequality violations and Wigner's argument.

Conclusion: QBism's ontological lesson suggests a radical indeterminism in quantum theory, emphasizing subjective probabilities and personal experiences. It contrasts with other interpretations like Bohr's and Everett's, and addresses Bell inequality violations and Wigner's argument. This perspective may influence future developments in quantum theory and humanity.

Abstract: QBism pursues the real by first eliminating the elements of quantum theory too fragile to be ontologies on their own. Thereafter, it seeks an "ontological lesson" from whatever remains. Here, we explore this program by highlighting three tenets of QBism. First, the Born Rule is a normative statement. It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should strive for, not a descriptive "law of nature." Second, all probabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they never tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum states thus have no "ontic hold" on the world, which implies a more radical kind of indeterminism in quantum theory than other interpretations understand. Third, quantum measurement outcomes just are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them. Thus all quantum measurement outcomes are local in the sense of the agent enacting them. Through these tenets, we explain four points better than previously: 1) how QBism contrasts with Bohr's concern over unambiguous language, 2) how QBism contrasts with the Everett interpretation, 3) how QBism understands the meaning of Bell inequality violations, and 4) how QBism responds to Wigner's "suspended animation" argument. Finally, we consider the ontological lesson of the tenets and ask what it might mean for the next one hundred years of quantum theory and humankind more generally.

TL;DR: The paper explores how trapped-ion systems can be controlled by tuning the curvature of the effective potential, providing a framework for precision quantum experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the behavior of informational and structural properties of trapped ions in response to changes in the effective potential, providing insights for precision quantum control and probing confinement, quantization scale, and information flow in engineered ion traps.

Method: The research examines how informational and structural properties of a single ion respond to controlled changes of the effective potential in a Paul trap modified by an optical lattice. The ground state of the system is considered, with trap frequency ω and lattice κ treated as independent tuning parameters to analyze Fisher information, Shannon entropy, and Fisher-Shannon complexity.

Result: The results show that Fisher information, Shannon entropy, and Fisher-Shannon complexity track the curvature of the effective potential, ω_eff=ω²√(1-κ). Sweeps of ω and κ confirm that the curvature, not the choice of control parameter, determines the system's behavior.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the trapped-ion platform offers a practical advantage for precision quantum control by allowing the curvature of the effective potential to be engineered without altering the harmonic characteristics of the system.

Abstract: In this work, we examine how the informational and structural properties of a single ion respond to controlled changes of the effective potential in a Paul trap modified by an optical lattice. We consider the ground state of the system where confinement is strongest. And by treating the trap frequency $ω$ and lattice $κ$ as independent tunning parameters, we show that Fisher information, Shannon entropy, and Fisher-Shannon complexity track the curvature of the effective potential $ω_{\mathrm{eff}}=ω^2\,\sqrt{1-κ}$. The $ω$ and $κ$ sweeps confirm that curvature and not the choice of control parameter determines the behaviour of the system. This gives the trapped-ion platform a clear advantage that the curvature can be engineered without altering the harmonic characteristics of the system. The interplay between $ω$ and $κ$ thus provides a practical route for precision quantum control and offers Information-theoretic framework for experiments that probe confinement, quantization scale, and information flow in engineered ion traps.

Abstract: Quantum-optical descriptions of strong-field processes have attracted significant attention in recent years. Typically, the theoretical modeling has been conducted in the Schrödinger picture, where results are only obtainable under certain approximations, while, in contrast, the Heisenberg picture has remained relatively unexplored. In this work, we develop an accurately controlled perturbative expansion of the time-evolution operator in the Heisenberg picture and derive beyond-semiclassical corrections to the emitter dynamics due to the coupling to the quantized electromagnetic field, capturing effects of the quantum fluctuations present in the latter. We focus on high-order harmonic generation (HHG), where the approach is accurate in parameter regimes of current interest and it gives closed-form expressions for key observables. This formulation not only simplifies numerical calculations compared to the Schrödinger-picture approach but also provides a clear correspondence between nonclassical features of the emitted light and the underlying induced dynamics of the generating medium including quantum fluctuations. Moreover, the Heisenberg framework naturally yields scaling relations with the number of independent emitters, enabling us to assess whether nonclassical behavior should persist under typical experimental conditions involving large emitter ensembles. Interestingly, we find that the degree of squeezing increases with the number of emitters, whereas the photon statistics approaches a classical Poissonian distribution in the many-emitter limit. We also find that the beyond-semiclassical emitter dynamics significantly enhances the degree of squeezing of the emitted light. Our work advances the theoretical understanding of quantum-optical HHG and introduces an accessible and well-controlled framework to describe realistic experiments.

Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) represent a promising fusion of quantum computing and neural network architectures, offering speed-ups and efficient processing of high-dimensional, entangled data. A crucial component of QNNs is the encoder, which maps classical input data into quantum states. However, choosing suitable encoders remains a significant challenge, largely due to the lack of systematic guidance and the trial-and-error nature of current approaches. This process is further impeded by two key challenges: (1) the difficulty in evaluating encoded quantum states prior to training, and (2) the lack of intuitive methods for analyzing an encoder's ability to effectively distinguish data features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel visualization tool, XQAI-Eyes, which enables QNN developers to compare classical data features with their corresponding encoded quantum states and to examine the mixed quantum states across different classes. By bridging classical and quantum perspectives, XQAI-Eyes facilitates a deeper understanding of how encoders influence QNN performance. Evaluations across diverse datasets and encoder designs demonstrate XQAI-Eyes's potential to support the exploration of the relationship between encoder design and QNN effectiveness, offering a holistic and transparent approach to optimizing quantum encoders. Moreover, domain experts used XQAI-Eyes to derive two key practices for quantum encoder selection, grounded in the principles of pattern preservation and feature mapping.

Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are non-equilibrium phases of matter that break the discrete time-translation symmetry and is characterized by a robust subharmonic response in periodically driven quantum systems. Here, we explore the DTC in a disorder-free, periodically kicked XXZ spin chain, which is stabilized by the Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation. We numerically show the period-doubling response of the conventional DTC order, and uncover a multiple-period response with beating dynamics due to the coherent interplay of multiple $π$-pairs in the Floquet spectrum of small-size systems. The lifetime of the DTC order exhibits independence of the driving frequency and a power-law dependence on the ZZ interaction strength. It also grows exponentially with the system size, as a hallmark of the strong fragmentation inherent to the Floquet model. We analytically reveal the approximate conservation of the magnetization and domain-wall number in the Floquet operator for the emergent strong fragmentation, which is consistent with numerical results of the dimensionality ratio of symmetry subspaces. The rigidity and phase regime of the DTC order are identified through finite-size scaling of the Floquet-spectrum-averaged mutual information, as well as via dynamical probes. Our work establishes the Floquet Hilbert space fragmentation as a disorder-free mechanism for sustaining nontrivial temporal orders in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Surface codes are a popular error-correction route to fault-tolerant quantum computation. The so-called exponential backlog problem that can arise when one has to do logical $T$-gates within the surface code demands real-time decoding of the syndrome information to diagnose the appropriate Pauli frame in which to do the gate. This in turn puts a minimum requirement on the communication rate between the quantum processing unit, where the syndrome information is collected, and the classical processor, where the decoding algorithm is run. This minimum communication rate can be difficult to achieve while preserving the quality of the quantum processor. Here, we present two decoders that make use of a reduced syndrome information volume, relying on a number of syndrome bits that scale only as the width -- and not the usual area -- of the surface-code patch. This eases the communication requirements necessary for real-time decoding.

Abstract: This study presents a generalized $n$-bit superdense coding protocol that enables the transmission of n classical bits of information using an entangled n--qubit quantum system and the transmission of $n-1$ qubits. The protocol involves creating a maximally entangled n--qubit state, encoding the classical message with Pauli--Z and Pauli--X gates, and then transmitting and decoding the message via quantum communication, quantum operations, and measurements. The key novelty of this work lies in the proposed n--bit encoding routine, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first explicit and scalable recipe for constructing quantum circuits for n--bit Superdense Coding, minimizing errors through a simple circuit design. The protocol was tested on real quantum hardware using Qiskit 2.0 and the IBM--Torino quantum computer for message lengths of 4, 6, 8, and 10 bits. Results show that success rates decrease as message length, circuit depth, and gate count increase, largely due to increased Pauli--X gate usage for messages with more ``1" bits. Strategies to improve performance include sending messages in shorter segments and advances in qubit coherence and gate fidelity. This work offers a practical and easily scalable quantum communication instruction with potential applications in quantum networks and communication systems.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个新颖的结构分类框架，用于理解量子相变，并为贝尔实验提供了精确的导航图。

Abstract: We establish a universal geometric framework that transforms the search for optimal nonlocal operators from a combinatorial black box into a deterministic predict-verify operation. We discover that the principal eigenvalue governing nonlocality is rigorously dictated by a low-dimensional manifold parameterized by merely two fundamental angular variables, $θ$ and $φ$, whose symmetry leads to further simplification. This geometric distillation establishes a precise mapping connecting external control parameters directly to optimal measurement configurations. Crucially, a comparative analysis of the geometric angles against the principal eigenvalue spectrum, including its magnitude, susceptibility, and nonlocal gap, reveals a fundamental dichotomy in quantum criticality. While transitions involving symmetry sector rotation manifest as geometric criticality with drastic operator reorientation, transitions dominated by strong anisotropy exhibit geometric locking, where the optimal basis remains robust despite clear signatures of phase transitions in the spectral indicators. This distinction offers a novel structural classification of quantum phase transitions and provides a precision navigation chart for Bell experiments.

TL;DR: Reality steering lets observers access alternate realities probabilistically by local memory erasure, but transitions are unverifiable and constrained by quantum mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how an observer can access different realities supported by the initial quantum state without reversing decoherence on the environment.

Method: The protocol of reality steering allows an observer to probabilistically access different realities by erasing 'which-outcome' information locally in the observer's memory.

Result: The mechanism enables navigation to different realities but is intrinsically constrained by the need for coherent participation from counterparts across branches and operational indistinguishability of transitions.

Conclusion: The study shifts multi-reality exploration from philosophical speculation to a concrete quantum-informational framework, albeit with intrinsic constraints.

Abstract: Quantum measurement resolves a superposition into a definite outcome by correlating it with an observer's memory -- a reality register. While the global quantum state remains coherent, the observer's local reality becomes singular and definite. This work introduces reality steering, a protocol that allows an observer to probabilistically access a different reality already supported by the initial quantum state, without reversing decoherence on the environment. The mechanism relies on locally erasing the 'which-outcome' information stored in the observer's brain. Here, 'local' means operations confined to the observer's memory, excluding the environment, which may be cosmically large. Reality steering nevertheless faces intrinsic constraints: successful navigation requires coherent participation from the observer's counterparts across the relevant branches, and any transition is operationally indistinguishable from non-transition. After arriving in a new reality, all memory records are perfectly consistent with that reality, leaving no internal evidence that a switch occurred. This makes conscious confirmation impossible within standard quantum mechanics. We show that nonlinear operations beyond the standard theory could, in principle, enable verifiable and deliberate navigation. Our results shift multi-reality exploration from philosophical speculation toward a concrete -- though fundamentally constrained -- quantum-informational framework.

Motivation: The motivation is to unify the description of thermodynamics with the geometric language used in fundamental physical theories, leveraging quantum control and information theory.

Method: The authors construct a principal fibre bundle to explore the geometric structure of quantum thermodynamics, identifying two distinct yet related geometric structures within the gauge theory framework.

Result: The results demonstrate the construction of a principal fibre bundle and reveal two geometric structures in quantum thermodynamics, connecting it to broader physical theories.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting how the geometric and topological properties of quantum thermodynamic structures can illuminate fundamental thermodynamic principles, bridging quantum mechanics and thermodynamics.

Abstract: Classical thermodynamics is a theory based on coarse-graining, meaning that the thermodynamic variables arise from discarding information related to the microscopic features of the system at hand. In quantum mechanics, however, where one has a high degree of control over microscopic systems, information theory plays an important role in describing the thermal properties of quantum systems. Recently, a new approach has been proposed in the form of a quantum thermodynamic gauge theory, where the notion of redundant information arises from a group of physically motivated gauge transformations called the thermodynamic group. In this work, we explore the geometrical structure of quantum thermodynamics. Particularly, we do so by explicitly constructing the relevant principal fibre bundle. We then show that there are two distinct (albeit related) geometric structures associated with the gauge theory of quantum thermodynamics. In this way, we express thermodynamics in the same mathematical (geometric) language as the fundamental theories of physics. Finally, we discuss how the geometric and topological properties of these structures may help explain fundamental properties of thermodynamics.

Abstract: Estimating molecular ground-state energies is a central application of quantum computing, requiring both the preparation of accurate quantum states and efficient energy readout. Understanding the effect of hardware noise on these experiments is crucial to distinguish errors that have low impact, errors that can be mitigated, and errors that must be reduced at the hardware level. We ran a state preparation and energy measurement protocol on an ion-trap quantum computer, without any non-scalable off-loading of computational tasks to classical computers, and show that leakage errors are the main obstacle to chemical accuracy. More specifically, we apply adiabatic state preparation to prepare the ground state of a six-qubit encoding of the H3+ molecule and extract its energy using a noise-resilient variant of iterative quantum phase estimation. Our results improve upon the classical Hartree-Fock energy. Analyzing the effect of hardware noise on the result, we find that while coherent and incoherent noise have little influence, the hardware results are mainly impacted by leakage errors. Absent leakage errors, noisy numerical simulations show that with our experimental settings we would have achieved close to chemical accuracy, even shot noise included. These insights highlight the importance of targeting leakage suppression in future algorithm and hardware development.

Abstract: Quantum computing promises to efficiently and accurately solve many important problems in quantum chemistry which elude classical solvers, such as the electronic structure problem of highly correlated materials. Two leading methods in solving the ground state problem are the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) algorithms. VQE often struggles with convergence due to the energy landscape being highly non-convex and the existence of barren plateaux, and implementing AQC is beyond the capabilities of current quantum devices as it requires deep circuits. Adiabatically-inspired algorithms aim to fill this gap. In this paper, we first present a unifying framework for these algorithms and then benchmark the following methods: the Adiabatically Assisted VQE (AAVQE) (Garcia-Saez and Latorre (2018)), the Variational Adiabatic Quantum Computing (VAQC) (Harwood et al (2022)), and the Adiabatic Quantum Computing with Parametrized Quantum Circuits (AQC-PQC) (Kolotouros et al (2025)) algorithms. Second, we introduce a novel hybrid approach termed G-AQC-PQC, which generalizes the AQC-PQC method, and combines adiabatic-inspired initialization with the low-memory BFGS optimizer, reducing the quantum computational cost of the method. Third, we compare the accuracy of the methods for chemistry applications using the beryllium hydride molecule (BeH$_2$). We compare the approaches across a number of different choices (ansätze types, depth, discretization steps, initial Hamiltonian, adiabatic schedules and method used). Our results show that the G-AQC-PQC outperforms conventional VQE. We further discuss limitations such as the zero-gradient problem and identify regimes where adiabatically-inspired methods offer a tangible advantage for near-term quantum chemistry applications.

Abstract: We explore the quantum-metrological potential of subwavelength-spaced emitter arrays coupled to a one-dimensional nanophotonic waveguide. In this system, strong dipole--dipole interactions profoundly modify the collective optical response, leading to the emergence of ultranarrow subradiant resonances. Through an eigenmode analysis of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we derive a universal scaling law for the decay rate of the most subradiant state, which exhibits an $ N^{-3} $ scaling with even-odd oscillatory behavior in the deep-subwavelength regime. This scaling is directly observable in the single-photon scattering spectrum, enabling the detection of minute changes in atomic separation with a figure of merit that scales as $ N^3 $. The quantum Fisher information (QFI) scales as $N^6$ and can be closely approached by measuring spectral shifts near the steepest slope of the most subradiant resonance. These enhancements remain robust under realistic positional disorder, confirming that dipole--dipole-engineered subradiance provides a viable resource for quantum metrology. Our work bridges many-body waveguide quantum electrodynamics and high-precision sensing, opening a route toward scalable quantum sensors on integrated nanophotonic platforms.

Abstract: Nonlocality is a defining feature of quantum mechanics and has long served as a key indicator of quantum resources since the formulation of Bell's inequalities. Identifying the contribution of nonlocality to extractable work remains a central problem in quantum thermodynamics. We address this by introducing a quantifier of nonlocal contributions to extractable work in bipartite systems. It is shown that closed form expressions can be calculated for our quantity in terms of the Schmidt coefficients. Further for strictly non-interacting Hamiltonian, the direct relationship between ergotropy and correlations is established. Our results reveal that nonlocal resources invariably enhance extractable work under non-interacting Hamiltonians, while in the presence of interactions, their contribution can either increase or diminish depending on the structure of the state and the Hamiltonian.

Abstract: With the latest advances in quantum computing technology, we are gradually moving from the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era characterized by hardware limited in the number of qubits and plagued with quantum noise, to the age of quantum utility where both the newest hardware and software methods allow for tackling problems which have been deemed difficult or intractable with conventional classical methods. One of these difficult problems is the simulation of one-dimensional (1D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, a major tool to learn about the structure of molecules, helping the design of new materials or drugs. Using advanced error mitigation and error suppression techniques from Q-CTRL together with the latest commercially available superconducting-qubit quantum computer from IBM and trapped-ion quantum computer from IonQ, we present the quantum Hamiltonian simulation of liquid-state 1D NMR spectra in the high-field regime for spin systems up to 34 spins. Our pipeline has a major impact on the ability to execute deep quantum circuits with the reduction of quantum noise, improving mean square error by a factor of 22. It allows for the execution of deep quantum circuits and obtaining salient features of the 1D NMR spectra for both 16-spin and 22-spin systems, as well as a 34-spin system, which lies beyond the regime where unrestricted full Liouvillespace simulations are practical (32 spins, the Liouville limit). Our work is a step toward near-term quantum utility in NMR spectroscopy.

Abstract: Continuously operating atom-light interfaces represent a key prerequisite for steady-state quantum sensors and efficient quantum processors. Here, we demonstrate continuous accumulation of sub-Doppler-cooled atoms in a shallow intracavity dipole trap, realizing this regime. The key ingredient is a light-shift manipulation that creates spatially varying cooling parameters, enabling efficient capture and accumulation of atoms within a cavity mode. Demonstrated with rubidium atoms, a continuous flux from a source cell is funneled through the magneto-optical trap into the cavity mode, where the atoms are cooled and maintained below $10~μ\text{K}$ in steady state without time-sequenced operation. We characterize the resulting continuously maintained ensemble of millions of atoms and its collective coupling to the cavity field, establishing a route toward continuously operated cavity-QED systems and long-duration atomic and hybrid quantum sensors.

Abstract: Cloud quantum platforms give users access to many backends with different qubit technologies, coupling layouts, and noise levels. The execution of a circuit, however, depends on internal allocation and routing policies that are not observable to the user. A provider may redirect jobs to more error-prone regions to conserve resources, balance load or for other opaque reasons, causing degradation in fidelity while still presenting stale or averaged calibration data. This lack of transparency creates a security gap: users cannot verify whether their circuits were executed on the hardware for which they were charged. Forensic methods that infer backend behavior from user-visible artifacts are therefore becoming essential. In this work, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based forensic framework that predicts per-qubit and per-qubit link error rates of an unseen backend using only topology information and aggregated features extracted from transpiled circuits. We construct a dataset from several IBM 27-qubit devices, merge static calibration features with dynamic transpilation features and train separate GNN regressors for one- and two-qubit errors. At inference time, the model operates without access to calibration data from the target backend and reconstructs a complete error map from the features available to the user. Our results on the target backend show accurate recovery of backend error rate, with an average mismatch of approximately 22% for single-qubit errors and 18% for qubit-link errors. The model also exhibits strong ranking agreement, with the ordering induced by predicted error values closely matching that of the actual calibration errors, as reflected by high Spearman correlation. The framework consistently identifies weak links and high-noise qubits and remains robust under realistic temporal noise drift.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) faces exponential measurement requirements and noise sensitivity in multi-qubit systems, bottlenecking practical quantum technologies. We present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework integrating quantum mechanical constraints via adaptive weighting, a residual-and-attention-enhanced architecture, and differentiable Cholesky parameterization for physical validity. Evaluations on 2--5 qubit systems and arbitrary-dimensional states show PINN consistently outperforms traditional neural networks (TNNs), achieving highest fidelity across all dimensions. PINN outperforms baselines, with marked improvements in moderately high-dimensional systems, superior noise robustness (slower performance degradation), and consistent dimensional robustness. Theoretical analysis shows physical constraints reduce Rademacher complexity and mitigate the curse of dimensionality via constraint-induced dimension and sample complexity reduction, effective regardless of qubit number. While experiments are limited to 5-qubit systems due to computational constraints, our theoretical framework (convergence guarantees, generalization bounds, scalability theorems) justifies PINN's advantages will persist and strengthen in larger systems (6+ qubits), where constraint-induced dimension reduction benefits grow with system size. Practically, this advances quantum error correction and gate calibration by reducing measurement requirements from O(4^n) to O(2^n) while maintaining high fidelity, enabling faster error correction cycles and accelerated calibration critical for scalable quantum computing.

Abstract: We study the fair sampling properties of hybrid quantum-classical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems with degenerate ground states. While quantum optimization heuristics such as quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) are known to induce biased sampling, hybrid quantum-classical MCMC incorporates quantum dynamics only as a proposal transition and enforces detailed balance through classical acceptance steps. Using small Ising models, we show that MCMC post-processing corrects the sampling bias of quantum dynamics and restores near-uniform sampling over degenerate ground states. We then apply the method to random $k$-SAT problems near the satisfiability threshold. For random 2-SAT, a hybrid MCMC combining QAOA-assisted neural proposals with single spin-flip updates achieves fairness comparable to that of PT-ICM. For random 3-SAT, where such classical methods are no longer applicable, the hybrid MCMC still attains approximately uniform sampling. We also examine solution counting and find that the required number of transitions is comparable to that of WalkSAT. These results indicate that hybrid quantum-classical MCMC provides a viable framework for fair sampling and solution enumeration.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The structure and quantification of entanglement in the W-class states are investigated under physically motivated transformations that induce mixed-state dynamics. A rigorous condition is established linking global separability to the behavior of pairwise entanglement, showing that the absence of pairwise entanglement is sufficient to guarantee complete separability of the system, provided the Hilbert-space basis is preserved. This result motivates the identification of the sum of two-tangles as a natural and effective entanglement quantifier for the W-class states. Furthermore, the commonly used $π$-tangle becomes ineffective for the maximally entangled $n$-qubit W state as the system size increases, vanishing in the large-$n$ limit. To address this limitation, the sum of $π$-tangles is introduced, which, like the sum of two-tangles, successfully quantifies the entanglement of the maximally entangled $n$-qubit W state in the large-$n$ limit. In addition, a new condition for entanglement measures is introduced, which facilitates the formulation of a well-behaved and physically meaningful entanglement measure.

Abstract: This work presents the first thorough exploration of how reset operations in cloud-based quantum computers could be exploited to run quantum circuits for free. This forms a new type of attack on the economics of cloud-based quantum computers. All major quantum computing companies today offer access to their hardware through some type of cloud-based service. Due to the noisy nature of quantum computers, a quantum circuit is run many times to collect the output statistics, and each run is called a shot. The fees users pay for access to the machines typically depend on the number of these shots of a quantum circuit that are executed. Per-shot pricing is a clean and straightforward approach as users are charged a small fee for each shot of their circuit. This work demonstrates that per-shot pricing can be exploited to get circuits to run for free when users abuse recently implemented mid-circuit qubit measurement and reset operations. Through evaluation on real, cloud-based quantum computers this work shows how multiple circuits can be executed together within a shot, by separating each user circuit by set of reset operations and submitting all the circuits, and reset operations, as one larger circuit. As a result, the user is charged per-shot pricing, even though inside each shot are multiple circuits. Total per-shot cost to run certain circuits could be reduced by up to $900$\% using methods proposed in this work, leading to significant financial losses to quantum computing companies. To address this novel finding, this work proposes a clear approach for how users should be charged for their execution, while maintaining the flexibility and usability of the mid-circuit measurement and reset~operations.

Abstract: In adaptive quantum circuits classical results of mid-circuit measurements determine the upcoming gates. This allows POVMs, quantum channels or more generally quantum instruments to be implemented sequentially, so that fewer qubits need to be used at each of the $N$ measurement steps. In this paper, we mathematically describe these problems via adaptive sequence of instruments (ASI) and show how any instrument can be decomposed into it. Number of steps $N$ and number of ancillary qubits $n_A$ needed for actual implementation are crucial parameters of any such ASI. We show an achievable lower bound on the product $N.n_A$ and we determine in which situations this tradeoff is likely to be optimal. Contrary to common intuition we show that for quantum instruments which transform $n$ to $m(>n)$ qubits, there exist $N$-step ASI implementing them just with $(m-n)$ ancillary qubits, which are remeasured $(N-1)$ times and finally used as output qubits.

### [64] [Improved Lower Bounds for QAC0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14643)
*Malvika Raj Joshi,Avishay Tal,Francisca Vasconcelos,John Wright*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper establishes strong lower bounds for QAC^0 circuits, showing limitations in computing PARITY and MAJORITY, and suggests classical circuits may match quantum performance for classical problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the computational limits of QAC^0 circuits, particularly their ability to compute or approximate functions like PARITY and MAJORITY, and to compare their power with classical AC^0 circuits.

Method: The paper employs new techniques for simulating QAC^0 circuits classically in AC^0. It relaxes the output requirement to a single bit for stronger depth 2 approximation bounds and compares quantum circuits with classical ones.

Result: (1) Depth 3 QAC^0 circuits cannot compute PARITY and require at least Ω(exp(√n)) gates for MAJORITY. (2) Depth 2 circuits cannot approximate high-influence Boolean functions. (3) Depth 2 QAC^0 circuits cannot exactly synthesize n-target nekomata states.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that QAC^0 circuits, even with polynomially many ancillae and gates, have significant limitations in computing functions like PARITY and MAJORITY. It also highlights that depth 2 QAC^0 circuits cannot approximate high-influence Boolean functions, suggesting that constant-depth quantum circuits do not inherently outperform classical counterparts for classical decision problems.

Abstract: In this work, we establish the strongest known lower bounds against QAC$^0$, while allowing its full power of polynomially many ancillae and gates. Our two main results show that:
  (1) Depth 3 QAC$^0$ circuits cannot compute PARITY regardless of size, and require at least $Ω(\exp(\sqrt{n}))$ many gates to compute MAJORITY.
  (2) Depth 2 circuits cannot approximate high-influence Boolean functions (e.g., PARITY) with non-negligible advantage in depth $2$, regardless of size.
  We present new techniques for simulating certain QAC$^0$ circuits classically in AC$^0$ to obtain our depth $3$ lower bounds. In these results, we relax the output requirement of the quantum circuit to a single bit (i.e., no restrictions on input preservation/reversible computation), making our depth $2$ approximation bound stronger than the previous best bound of Rosenthal (2021). This also enables us to draw natural comparisons with classical AC$^0$ circuits, which can compute PARITY exactly in depth $2$ using exponential size. Our proof techniques further suggest that, for inherently classical decision problems, constant-depth quantum circuits do not necessarily provide more power than their classical counterparts. Our third result shows that depth $2$ QAC$^0$ circuits, regardless of size, cannot exactly synthesize an $n$-target nekomata state (a state whose synthesis is directly related to the computation of PARITY). This complements the depth $2$ exponential size upper bound of Rosenthal (2021) for approximating nekomatas (which is used as a sub-circuit in the only known constant depth PARITY upper bound).

Abstract: We present results of a photon-free exchange-correlation functional within the local density approximation (pxcLDA) for quantum electrodynamics density functional theory (QEDFT) that efficiently describes the electron density of many-electron systems across weak to strong light-matter coupling. Building on previous work [I-Te. Lu et al., Phys. Rev. A 109, 052823 (2024)] that captured electron-photon correlations via an exchange-correlation functional derived from the nonrelativistic Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian and tested on one-electron systems, we use a simple procedure to compute a renormalization factor describing electron-photon correlations and inhomogeneity in the weak-coupling regime by comparing it with quantum electrodynamics coupled-cluster, and previous QEDFT optimized effective potential methods. Across various atoms and molecules, pxcLDA reproduces cavity-modified densities in close agreement with these references. The renormalization factor approaches unity as the system size or collective coupling increases, reflecting an electron-photon exchange-dominated behavior and improved accuracy for larger systems. This approach now offers a practical route to applying QEDFT functionals based on electron density to realistic electron systems.

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures combining two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnets and semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer highly promising opportunities for tailoring 2D magnetism through interfacial proximity effects, enabling unique physical phenomena inaccessible in 3D systems and achieving functionalities beyond conventional spintronics. However, current fabrication of vdW heterostructures still relies heavily on the manual stacking of exfoliated 2D flakes, leading to critical challenges in scalability, interfacial quality, thickness control and device integration. This work reports on the realization of all-epitaxial, high-quality Fe5-xGeTe2(FGT)/WSe2 heterostructures exhibiting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and room-temperature ferromagnetism. The FGT/WSe2 system demonstrates temperature-driven magnetic transitions, higher-order PMA contributions and large anisotropic magnetoresistance, highlighting sublattice-specific contributions to magnetic and transport properties. Notably, the FGT/WSe2 heterostructures display unconventional physical phenomena, including thickness- and temperature-dependent sign reversal of exchange bias, a reversed thickness trend in the unconventional Hall effect, and a non-monotonic PMA-thickness dependence. These anomalies indicate pronounced interfacial contributions arising from proximity effects enhanced by epitaxial interface quality. Collectively, this study provides deep insights into the magnetic and transport properties of FGT/WSe2 vdW heterostructures, establishing a scalable platform for exploring emergent 2D physics and advancing next-generation 2D spintronic technologies.

Abstract: Spin spirals represent a fundamental class of noncollinear yet coplanar magnetic structures that give rise to diverse emergent phenomena reflecting spin chirality. We investigate metallic systems hosting commensurate spin spirals and uncover an unconventional anomalous Hall effect (AHE) induced by spiral magnetism. The spin spiral introduces odd-parity spin splitting with polarization perpendicular to the helical plane, forming spin-nodal lines in the electronic structure. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, we find that these nodal lines become gapped by finite magnetization, concentrating the Berry curvature near the gap and generating a distinctive AHE. We identify the interplay among the spin-orbit coupling, helical plane orientation, and magnetization direction as the key ingredient for this spiral-induced AHE, which is expected to occur across a wide range of materials hosting commensurate spin spirals.

Abstract: Diffusive approximations of Markov jump processes often fail to accurately capture large fluctuations. This is confounding, as the rare events triggered by these large fluctuations, such as the failure of electronic memories, are often the object of interest. In this paper we present an improved diffusive approximation, extending a method previously limited to equilibrium systems. Using new tools from stochastic thermodynamics, we prove its validity to linear order in departures from equilibrium and demonstrate its superior accuracy over the Kramers-Moyal expansion in predicting both steady-state and transient properties, including the error rate of a non-equilibrium electronic memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for new probes to investigate the electronic properties of 2D van der Waals materials due to the limitations of conventional methods.

Method: Second-order perturbation theory combined with solving the exciton-electron scattering problem to analyze the interaction between excitons and electrons in a moiré lattice.

Result: Excitons in a moiré lattice can act as optical probes for spatially resolved electron spin density correlations, with measurable energy shifts in the exciton spectrum.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme provides a novel optical method to probe electron spin density correlations in 2D materials, enabling insights into quantum phase transitions and superconducting phases.

Abstract: The rapidly growing class of atomically thin and tunable van der Waals materials is intensely investigated both in the context of fundamental science and for new technologies. There is in this connection a widespread need for new ways to probe the electronic properties of these layered materials, since their two-dimensional (2D) character make conventional probes less efficient. Here, we show how excitons trapped in a moiré lattice can be used as an optical probe for spatially resolved electron spin density correlations in such materials. The electrons in the material of interest virtually tunnel to the moiré lattice where they scatter on the excitons after which they tunnel back. This gives rise to an effective spin-dependent and spatially localised potential felt by the electrons, which in turn leads to energy shifts that can be measured spectroscopically in the exciton spectrum. Using second order perturbation theory combined with a solution to the exciton-electron scattering problem, we show that the electrons mediate an interaction between two excitons resulting in an energy shift proportional to their two-point spin density-density correlation function evaluated at the exciton positions. We then discuss two specific applications of our setup. First, we show that quantum phase transitions between different in-plane anti-ferromagnetic orders in a 2D lattice give rise to large and measurable shifts in the exciton spectrum in the critical regions. Second, we analyse how different pairing symmetries of superconducting phases can be probed. This demonstrates that our scheme opens up new ways to probe electron spin density correlations, which is a key property of many quantum phases predicted to exist in the new 2D materials.

Abstract: We analyze theoretically THz response of an electron-hole pair confined in a semiconductor nanoparticle. We show that the interplay of particle confinement and electron-hole Coulomb interaction leads to significant renormalizations and energy shifts in THz linear conductivity of the nanocrystal. We develop and evaluate models in the strong and the weak confinement regime in order to correctly address the effect of Coulomb interaction. In the weak confinement regime, we find solutions of the problem in a form similar to the Wannier wavefunction whose spatial extent is reduced as a consequence of the confinement. The resulting states are scalable down to the strong confinement regime, enabling a theoretical description of the exciton response for arbitrarily sized nanoparticles.

Motivation: Design a passive detector that directly converts input power to voltage without external bias modulation, addressing the need for efficient and scalable detectors for cosmological experiments.

Method: Numerical simulation of the full nonlinear thermal dynamical model of a Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction, considering heating on both sides of the junction.

Result: Noise Equivalent Power (NEP) of ~4×10^-17 W/√Hz, response time of ~200 ns, and integration time for SNR=1 of ~100 μs for an input power of ~10^-13 W.

Conclusion: The superconducting thermoelectric bolometer demonstrates promising performance for large-array cosmological applications, with advantages in fabrication and heat budget.

Abstract: We design a superconducting thermoelectric bolometer made of a Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction. Our detector has the advantage of being passive, as it directly transduces input power to a voltage without the need to modulate an external bias. We characterize the device via numerical simulation of the full nonlinear thermal dynamical model of the junction, considering heating of both sides of the junction. While estimating noise contributions, we found novel expressions due to the temperatures of both sides being different than the bath temperature. Numerical simulations show a Noise Equivalent Power ${\rm NEP}\sim 4\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm W}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for an input power of $\sim10^{-16}\,{\rm W}$, a response time of $τ_{th}\sim 200\, {\rm ns}$ and an integration time to obtain a Signal-to-Noise Ratio ${\rm SNR}=1$ of $τ_{\rm SNR=1}\sim 100\,μ{\rm s}$ for an input power $\sim 10^{-13}\,{\rm W}$. Therefore, the device shows promise for large-array cosmological experiment applications, also considering its advantages for fabrication and heat budget.

Abstract: Mechanical degrees of freedom very weakly couple to spins in semiconductors. The inefficient coupling between phonons and single electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) hinders their integration into on-chip acoustically coupled quantum hybrid systems. We propose a hybrid acousto-optical spin control method that circumvents this problem and effectively introduces acoustic spin rotation to QDs, complementing their rich couplings with external fields and quantum registers. We show that combining continuous-wave detuned optical coupling to a trion state and acoustic modulation results in spin rotation around an axis defined by the acoustic field. The optical field breaks spin conservation, allowing phonons to drive transitions between disrupted spin states when at resonance with the Zeeman frequency. Our method is compatible with pulse sequences that mitigate quasi-static noise effects, which makes trion recombination the primary limitation to gate fidelity under cooled nuclear-spin conditions. Numerical simulations indicate that spin rotation fidelity can be very high, if the trion lifetime is long and Zeeman splitting is sufficiently large, with a currently feasible 50~ns lifetime and 44~GHz splitting giving 99.9\% fidelity. Applying our advancement could enable acoustic QD spin state transfer to diverse solid-state systems and transduction between acoustic, optical, and microwave domains, all within an on-chip integration-ready setting.

Result: Demonstrated pronounced spin separation, controlled spin-selective transport, and strong enhancement of thermoelectric performance, with the spin figure of merit surpassing its charge counterpart.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significant role of lattice geometry and antiferromagnetic order in enhancing spin thermoelectric efficiency, offering a theoretical platform for designing advanced spin-caloritronic devices.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin-resolved thermoelectric transport in a triangular ladder geometry hosting antiferromagnetic spin alignment, where lattice topology and magnetic ordering jointly enable highly efficient spin-selective energy conversion. The inherent geometric frustration of the ladder, together with intrinsic spin-filtering mechanisms, is shown to promote a pronounced separation between spin channels. Implementing spin-dependent onsite modulations, such as binary asymmetric potentials, induces pronounced spin splitting in the transmission spectrum, enabling controlled spin-selective transport and highlighting the role of lattice engineering in tailoring spin-dependent thermoelectric response. Additional control is achieved through modulation of the hopping amplitudes, which activates multiple transport pathways and allows fine tuning of spin-dependent conduction. A detailed evaluation of charge and spin thermoelectric coefficients reveals a strong enhancement of the thermoelectric performance, with the dimensionless figure of merit ZT reaching large values in optimized parameter regimes. Notably, the spin figure of merit systematically surpasses its charge counterpart, underscoring the decisive role of lattice geometry and antiferromagnetic order in amplifying spin thermoelectric efficiency. Our findings provide a versatile theoretical platform for designing low-dimensional spin-caloritronic devices with enhanced functionality.

Abstract: Strain engineering enables quantum confinement in pristine graphene without degrading its intrinsic mobility and spin coherence. Here, we extend previously proposed strain-induced charge-qubit architectures by incorporating spin degrees of freedom through Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and Zeeman fields, enabling spin-qubit operation in single-layer graphene (SLG). In a graphene p-n junction, a strain-induced nanobubble generates a pseudo-magnetic field that forms double quantum dots with gate-tunable level hybridization. Tight-binding quantum transport simulations and a four-band model reveal two distinct avoided crossings: spin-conserving gaps at zero detuning and spin-flip gaps at finite detuning, the latter increasing with SOC strength while the former decreases. Time-domain simulations confirm detuning-dependent Rabi oscillations corresponding to these two operational regimes. These results demonstrate that strain-induced confinement combined with tunable SOC provides a viable mechanism for coherent spin manipulation in pristine graphene, positioning strained SLG as a promising platform for scalable spin-based quantum technologies.

Abstract: We develop a theory of thermomagnonic torques in insulating altermagnets and predict a spin-splitter magnonic torque arising from the spin Seebeck effect. Additionally, we predict an anisotropic entropic torque. We study the effects of these torques on magnetic-texture dynamics and identify various anisotropic responses to temperature gradients. In particular, we predict spin-current-induced domain-wall precession, which can slow domain-wall motion for certain temperature-gradient directions. We also predict a temperature-gradient-driven anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect that enables fast skyrmion motion in response to thermal gradients. Our findings will be useful for spintronic applications such as magnetic racetrack memories and will serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in insulating altermagnets with magnetic textures.

Motivation: The research is motivated by recent experiments in twisted MoTe2 that showed optical control of magnetization, aiming to explore magnetization dynamics in strongly correlated states.

Result: The study highlights the role of non-trivial quantum geometry in magnetization dynamics and the ability to dynamically access properties of chiral edge modes in quantum Hall ferromagnets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of nonequilibrium protocols for controlling and probing strongly correlated phases, particularly in twisted MoTe2 and graphene-based flat-band ferromagnets.

Abstract: Dynamical control of quantum matter is a challenging, yet promising direction for probing strongly correlated states. Motivated by recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$ that demonstrated optical control of magnetization, we propose a protocol for probing magnetization dynamics in flat-band ferromagnets. We investigate the nucleation and dynamical growth of magnetic bubbles prepared on top of a false vaccum in both itinerant ferromagnets and spin-polarized Chern insulators. For ferromagnetic metals, we emphasize the crucial role of a non-trivial quantum geometry in the magnetization dynamics, which in turn also provides a probe for the quantum metric. Furthermore, for quantum Hall ferromagnets, we show how properties of chiral edge modes localized at domain-wall boundaries can be dynamically accessed. Our work demonstrates the potential for nonequilibrium protocols to control and probe strongly correlated phases, with particular relevance for twisted MoTe$_2$ and graphene-based flat-band ferromagnets.

*Hui Yang,Ya-Hui Zhang*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Proposed a minimal model for bilayer nickelates showing how competition between magnetism and superconductivity leads to SDW order and superconductivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify the superconducting phase with the spin-density-wave (SDW) phase in bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 without external pressure or strain.

Method: Proposed a model with half-filled d_z^2 local moments interacting with itinerant d_x^2-y^2 electrons via strong Hund's coupling. Utilized iDMRG calculations on an L_y=4, L_z=2 cylinder to demonstrate competition between double-exchange ferromagnetism and in-plane superexchange.

Result: Demonstrated that competition between double-exchange ferromagnetism and in-plane superexchange generates period-4 stripe-like SDW order. Increasing interlayer exchange coupling suppresses magnetic order and stabilizes interlayer s-wave superconductivity.

Conclusion: The type-II t-J model is identified as a minimal framework for understanding the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ necessitates a minimal theoretical model that unifies the superconducting phase with the spin-density-wave (SDW) phase without external pressure or strain. We propose a model where half-filled $d_{z^{2}}$ local moments interact with itinerant $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ electrons via strong Hund's coupling $J_H$, which reduces to a bilayer type-II t-J model in the large $J_H$ limit. Using iDMRG calculations on an $L_y=4, L_z=2$ cylinder, we demonstrate that the competition between double-exchange ferromagnetism and in-plane superexchange generates period-4 stripe-like SDW order-a feature absent in one-orbital t-J model with only $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Furthermore, increasing the interlayer exchange coupling suppresses magnetic order and stabilizes interlayer s-wave superconductivity. These results identify the type-II t-J model as a minimal framework for capturing the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.

Abstract: We study the one-dimensional S=1 XXZ spin model with single-ion anisotropy. It is known that at the transition points between the Haldane and large-D phases, the model exhibits a quantum criticality described by the Gaussian theory, i.e., a conformal field theory with the central charge c=1. Using the bosonization approach, we investigate various correlation functions at the phase transition and derive their asymptotic forms. This allows us to clarify their peculiar behavior: the longitudinal (transverse) two-point spin correlation function has components that decay algebraically only in the uniform (staggered) sector. These theoretical predictions are verified by the numerical calculations using the density-matrix renormalization group method. The effect of weak bond alternation on the critical ground state at the phase transition is also discussed. It is shown that the bond alternation induces the missing power-law components in the correlation functions.

Abstract: We propose a method to determine the quantum phase boundaries of one-dimensional systems using sine-square deformation (SSD). Based on the proposition, supported by several exactly solved cases though not proven in full generality, that ``if a one-dimensional system is gapless, then the expectation value of any local observable in the ground state of the Hamiltonian with SSD exhibits translational symmetry in the thermodynamic limit," we determine the quantum critical point as the location where a local observable becomes site-independent, identified through finite-size scaling analysis. As case studies, we consider two models: the antiferromagnetic Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions. We calculate the ground state of these Hamiltonians with SSD using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm and evaluate the local transverse magnetization. For the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the quantum critical point can be accurately estimated by our procedure with systems of up to 84 sites, or even smaller, in good agreement with results from the literature. For the long-range model, we find that the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is slightly shifted relative to the nearest-neighbor case, leading to a reduced region of antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, we propose an experimental procedure to implement the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising couplings with SSD using Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers, which can be achieved within a very good approximation. Because multiple independent scaling conditions naturally emerge, our approach enables precise determination of quantum critical points and possibly even the extraction of additional critical phenomena, such as critical exponents, from relatively small system sizes.

Abstract: We investigate the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the ruby lattice with uniform first- and second-neighbor interactions, which forms a two-dimensional network of corner-sharing tetrahedra. Using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS), we study the ground state of the system to find that it assumes a gapped threefold-degenerate simplex crystal ground state, with strong singlets formed on pairs of neighboring triangles. We argue that the formation of the simplex singlet ground state at the isotropic point relates to the weak inter-triangle coupling limit where an effective spin-chirality Hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice exhibits an extensively degenerate ground state manifold of singlet coverings at the mean-field level. Under an applied Zeeman field, the iPEPS simulations uncover magnetization plateaus at $m/m_s = 0, 1/3, 1/2,$ and $2/3$, separated by intermediate supersolid phases, all breaking the sixfold rotational symmetry of the lattice. Unlike the checkerboard lattice, these plateaus cannot be described by strongly localized magnons.

TL;DR: Soft phonon modes in CeCoSi, linked to structural and magnetic transitions, were studied via x-ray scattering, revealing lattice instability due to 4f-5d hybridization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aimed to understand the structural transition and antiferromagnetic order in tetragonal CeCoSi by examining its soft phonon modes.

Method: High-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering was used to investigate the soft phonon modes in tetragonal CeCoSi.

Result: Pronounced softening was detected in the transverse acoustic modes, consistent with the experimentally determined triclinic structure. The softening persists up to the zone boundary, indicating a short correlation length of the lattice instability.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the observed soft phonon modes in tetragonal CeCoSi are a result of on-site 4f-5d hybridization, driven by the lack of inversion symmetry at the Ce sites. The persistence of softening up to the zone boundary suggests a short correlation length of the lattice instability.

Abstract: Soft phonon modes in tetragonal CeCoSi, which undergoes a structural transition at $T_0=12$ K followed by antiferromagnetic order at $T_{\text{N}}=9.5$ K, have been investigated using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering. Pronounced softening was detected in the transverse acoustic modes corresponding to the $(yz+zx)$-type monoclinic distortion, consistent with the experimentally determined triclinic structure. Remarkably, the softening persists up to the zone boundary along (0, 0, $q$), indicating a short correlation length of the lattice instability. This instability, characterized by a Curie-type strain susceptibility, is interpreted as a consequence of the on-site $4f$-$5d$ hybridization, which is intrinsic to this crystal structure due to the lack of inversion symmetry at the two Ce sites.

Abstract: Analysis of the thermal and baric evolution of resistance in $LaBa_2Fe_3O_{8+δ}$ enabled the construction of its pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagram, which prominently displays a critical boundary, $P^{MIT}_c(T)$, marking the transition from localized to hole-type extended states. The relatively low critical pressures [$P^{MIT}_c(T) \approx 3$-8 GPa] suggest that, as $P \rightarrow P_c$ in this narrow-gap, strongly correlated charge-transfer system, both the hybridization strength and the charge-transfer character are progressively enhanced - ultimately leading to the emergence of metallicity. Emphasizing the electronic nature of this transition, pressure-dependent structural analyses at room temperature reveal no associated structural phase transition at $P^{MIT}_c(T)$; the system retains a (weakly tetragonally distorted) quasicubic perovskite structure with Murnaghan-type compressibility up to 30\,GPa. The emergence of hole delocalization and metallic conduction, coupled with suppressed antiferromagnetism, suggests proximity to quantum criticality.

TL;DR: Analysis of lattice geometry's impact on magnetic transitions shows DMFT overestimates transition temperatures, mitigated by nonlocal corrections in DΓA, with frustration eliminating order in fcc lattices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how lattice geometry and correlation effects influence magnetic transitions in strongly interacting electron systems.

Method: The research employs dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and dynamical vertex approximation (DΓA) to analyze magnetic transitions, comparing results for different lattice geometries including 3d-sc, 4d-sc, bcc, and fcc lattices.

Result: Nonlocal correlations substantially reduce DMFT transition temperatures, with the effect diminishing as coordination number increases. The fcc lattice's ordered phase vanishes in DΓA due to geometric frustration.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of considering nonlocal correlations in accurately predicting magnetic transition temperatures, with DMFT overestimating these temperatures, especially in less frustrated lattices. The fcc lattice's strong geometric frustration leads to the vanishing of the ordered phase within DΓA.

Abstract: We analyze the impact of the lattice geometry on the thermodynamic transition to magnetically ordered phases in strongly interacting electron systems for various Bravais lattices in three and four dimensions, including both local and nonlocal correlation effects. In a first step we use the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which takes into account purely local correlations, to calculate the magnetic susceptibilities of the Hubbard model on three (3d-sc) and four dimensional (4d-sc) simple cubic/hypercubic, as well as on three dimensional body- (bcc) and face-centered (fcc) cubic lattices, and determine the transition temperature to the corresponding magnetically-ordered state. In a second step, we exploit the dynamical vertex approximation (D$Γ$A), a diagrammatic extension of DMFT, to include the effect of nonlocal correlations which are particularly important in the vicinity of the corresponding phase transition. For the bipartite 3d-sc, 4d-sc and bcc lattices nonlocal fluctuations lead to a substantial reduction of the DMFT transition temperature consistent to the overall tendency of mean-field approaches to overestimate the stability of ordered phases. As expected, the magnitude of the difference between the DMFT, being exact in the limit of large connectivity/dimensions, and D$Γ$A transition temperatures decreases with increasing coordination number. On a more practical perspective, these results also provide a reasonable guidance to evaluate the expected overestimation of the DMFT ordering temperature for different material geometries. For the fcc lattice, on the other hand, the ordered phase observed in DMFT vanishes completely within D$Γ$A which is consistent with the existence of strong geometric frustration in this lattice.

Abstract: We propose a single-layer tensor network framework for the variational determination of ground states in two-dimensional quantum lattice models. By combining the nested tensor network method [Phys. Rev. B 96, 045128 (2017)] with the automatic differentiation technique, our approach can reduce the computational cost by three orders of magnitude in bond dimension, and therefore enables highly efficient variational ground-state calculations. We demonstrate the capability of this framework through two quantum spin models: the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice and the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model. Even without GPU acceleration or symmetry implimention, we have achieved the bond dimension of 9 and obtained accurate ground-state energy and consistent order parameters compared to prior studies. In particular, we confirm the existence of an intermediate empty-plaquette valence bond solid ground state in the Shastry-Sutherland model. We have further discussed the convergence of the algorithm and its potential improvements. Our work provides a promising route for large-scale tensor network calculations of two-dimensional quantum systems.

Abstract: It is generally argued that Mermin-Wagner theorem excludes the possibility of long-range order in two dimensional bosonic systems at non-zero temperatures. In contrast, we show here that generic bilayer semiconductors could demonstrate true Bose-Einstein condensation of interlayer excitons. We show that the key requirements include (i) reduction of the interlayer band gap using an applied electric field so that excitons spontaneously appear in the ground state, (ii) band structure that allows for long-range electron-hole exchange interaction, and (iii) a finite magnetic field. Our results indicate that superfluidity and ferroelectric order can co-exist in two dimensional excitonic insulators.

Abstract: The ferroelectric semiconductor α-GeTe(111) has attracted significant attention in the last decade due to its unique properties, with extensive studies focusing on its occupied electronic bandstructure. In contrast, its unoccupied states - particularly those near the conduction band minimum - remain largely unexplored. In an effort to characterize those states, we surprisingly observe three image potential states (IPS) in α-GeTe(111) extending up to 0.8 eV above the vacuum level. Using time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we resolve the full parabolic dispersions of the first three IPS and determine their binding energies. Our analysis, combined with Bloch spectral function calculations, reveals that the unexpected persistence of IPS above the vacuum level originates from strong dipole transitions and the presence of large electron reservoirs in GeTe.
