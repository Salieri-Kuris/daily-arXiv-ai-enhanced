Abstract: Quantum teleportation is a foundational protocol for sending quantum information through entanglement distribution and classical communication. Assuming ideal classical communication, the reliability of quantum teleportation is limited by the fidelity of the shared EPR pairs. This reliability can be improved through two mechanisms: entanglement purification and quantum error correction (QEC). Using both techniques in concert requires flexible QEC rates, since purification alters the structure of errors induced by imperfect-EPR teleportation, and fixed-rate codes cannot be uniformly effective across purification regimes or reliability targets. In this work, we supplement purification with punctured QEC codes, providing a family of code variants that can be adapted to error-channel characteristics and reliability targets. Punctured codes improve teleportation reliability across a broader range of purification regimes, enabling target reliability to be met without hardware-level code switching. This is corroborated by numerical results, showing that different punctured codes achieve the lowest logical error probability in different operating regimes, and that selecting among them reduces logical error relative to fixed-rate encoded teleportation. This reduction relaxes the requirement on the initial EPR fidelity or purification needed to achieve a target reliability. Overall, puncturing enables adaptation to varying entanglement conditions and reliability requirements while reusing a single stabilizer structure.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Quasi-probabilities appear across diverse areas of physics, but their conceptual foundations remain unclear: they are often treated merely as computational tools, and operations like conditioning and Bayes' theorem become ambiguous. We address both issues by developing a principled framework that derives quasi-probabilities and their conditional calculus from structural consistency requirements on how statements are valued across different universes of discourse, understood as finite Boolean algebras of statements.We begin with a universal valuation that assigns definite (possibly complex) values to all statements. The central concept is Syntactic Locality: every universe can be embedded within a larger ambient one, and the universal valuation must behave coherently under such embeddings and restrictions. From a set of structural principles, we prove a representation theorem showing that every admissible valuation can be re-expressed as a finitely additive measure on mutually exclusive statements, mirroring the usual probability sum rule. We call such additive representatives pre-probabilities. This representation is unique up to an additive regraduation freedom. When this freedom can be fixed canonically, pre-probabilities reduce to finite quasi-probabilities, thereby elevating quasi-probability theory from a computational device to a uniquely determined additive representation of universal valuations. Classical finite probabilities arise as the subclass of quasi-probabilities stable under relativisation, i.e., closed under restriction to sub-universes. Finally, the same framework enables us to define a coherent theory of conditionals, yielding a well-defined generalized Bayes' theorem applicable to both pre-probabilities and quasi-probabilities. We conclude by discussing additional regularity conditions, including the role of rational versus irrational probabilities in this setting.

Abstract: Feedback-based methods have gained significant attention as an alternative training paradigm for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in solving combinatorial optimization problems such as MAX-CUT. In particular, Quantum Lyapunov Control (QLC) employs feedback-driven control laws that guarantee monotonic non-decreasing objective values, can substantially reduce the training overhead of QAOA, and mitigate barren plateaus. However, these methods might require long control sequences, leading to sub-optimal convergence rates. In this work, we propose a hybrid method that incorporates per-layer gradient estimation to accelerate the convergence of QLC while preserving its low training overhead and stability guarantees. By leveraging layer-wise gradient information, the proposed approach selects near-optimal control parameters, resulting in significantly faster convergence and improved robustness. We validate the effectiveness of the method through extensive numerical experiments across a range of problem instances and optimization settings.

Abstract: Distributed quantum protocols rely on classical feedforward information to process measurement outcomes, but heterogeneous hardware and uncertain local timing can make the causal order of measurements ambiguous when inferred solely from arrival times. Even in simple line networks with only Pauli measurements, end nodes cannot distinguish whether a missing outcome is caused by slow measurement or by delayed classical propagation. To resolve this ambiguity, we propose a time-division architecture for quantum networks in which nodes perform measurements in pre-assigned slots, ensuring a unique causal interpretation of outcomes. We formalize this temporal framework and derive the feedforward and adjacency constraints required to preserve measurement causality. For simple network topologies, we present an algorithm that yields optimal measurement schedules. Overall, the proposed time-division model provides a practical coordination layer that bridges the classical network timing with quantum measurement processing, enabling reliable and scalable measurement-based quantum networking.

Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising research direction that integrates quantum information processing into reinforcement learning frameworks. While many existing QRL studies apply quantum agents to classical environments, it has been realized that the potential advantages of QRL are most naturally explored in environments that exhibit intrinsically quantum characteristics, where the agent's observations and interactions arise from quantum processes. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning environment formulated as a challenge-response task with hidden information. In the proposed environment, Alice encodes a classical bit into the parameters of a quantum circuit, while Bob, with a trained reinforcement learning agent, interacts with a limited number of quantum state copies to infer the hidden bit. The agent must select measurement strategies and decide when to terminate the interaction under explicit resource constraints. To study the solvability of the proposed environment, we consider three agents: a purely classical agent, a lightweight hybrid agent and a deep hybrid agent. Through experiments, we analyze the trade-off between inference accuracy and quantum resource consumption under varying interaction penalties. Our results show that the lightweight hybrid agent achieves reliable inference using as few as two quantum state copies, outperforming both the classical baseline and the deep hybrid agent in highly resource-constrained regimes. We further evaluate robustness under realistic quantum noise models and discuss the relevance of the proposed environment for security-oriented applications, including quantum-assisted authentication.

Abstract: Within quantum machine learning, parametrized quantum circuits provide flexible quantum models, but their performance is often highly task-dependent, making manual circuit design challenging. Alternatively, quantum architecture search algorithms have been proposed to automate the discovery of task-specific parametrized quantum circuits using systematic frameworks. In this work, we propose an evolution-inspired heuristic quantum architecture search algorithm, which we refer to as the local quantum architecture search. The goal of the local quantum architecture search algorithm is to optimize parametrized quantum circuit architectures through a local, probabilistic search over a fixed set of gate-level actions applied to existing circuits. We evaluate the local quantum architecture search algorithm on two synthetic function-fitting regression tasks and two quantum chemistry regression datasets, including the BSE49 dataset of bond separation energies for first- and second-row elements and a dataset of water conformers generated using the data-driven coupled-cluster approach. Using state-vector simulation, our results highlight the applicability of local quantum architecture search algorithm for identifying competitive circuit architectures with desirable performance metrics. Lastly, we analyze the properties of the discovered circuits and demonstrate the deployment of the best-performing model on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.

Abstract: Working within the quantum filtering framework, we establish a dynamic programming principle in an infinite-dimensional setting by embedding the state space into the Hilbert-Schmidt space. We then study a stabilization problem for continuously monitored Ising-coupled qubits and, in the mean-field limit, demonstrate quantum state reduction together with exponential convergence toward prescribed eigenstates under suitable feedback laws.

Abstract: Estimating many local expectation values over time is a central measurement bottleneck in quantum simulation and device characterization. We study the task of reconstructing the Pauli-signal matrix $S_{ij}=\text{Tr}(O_i ρ(t_j))$ for a collection of $M$ low-weight Pauli observables $\{O_i\}_{i=1}^M$ over $N$ timesteps $\{t_j\}_{j=1}^N$, while minimizing the total number of device shots. We propose a Compressed Sensing Shadow Tomography (CSST) protocol that combines two complementary reductions. First, local classical shadows reduce the observable dimension by enabling many Pauli expectation values to be estimated from the same randomized snapshots at a fixed time. Second, compressed sensing reduces the time dimension by exploiting the fact that many expectation-value traces are spectrally sparse or compressible in a unitary (e.g., Fourier) transform basis. Operationally, CSST samples $m\ll N$ timesteps uniformly at random, collects shadows only at those times, and then reconstructs each length-$N$ signal via standard $\ell_1$-based recovery in the unitary transform domain. We provide end-to-end guarantees that explicitly combine shadow estimation error with compressed sensing recovery bounds. For exactly $s$-sparse signals in a unitary transform basis, we show that $m=O \left(s\log^2 s \log N\right)$ random timesteps suffice (with high probability), leading to total-shot savings scaling as $\widetildeΘ(N/s)$ (i.e., up to polylogarithmic factors) relative to collecting shadows at all $N$ timesteps. For approximately sparse signals, the reconstruction error decomposes into a compressibility (tail) term plus a noise term. We present numerical experiments on noisy many-qubit dynamics that support strong Fourier compressibility of Pauli traces and demonstrate substantial shot reductions with accurate reconstruction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Estimating thermal expectation values of observables is a fundamental task in quantum physics, quantum chemistry, and materials science. While recent quantum algorithms have enabled efficient quantum preparation of thermal states, observable estimation via sampling remains costly: a straightforward implementation separates successive measurements by a full mixing time in order to ensure samples are approximately independent. In this work, we show that the sampling cost can be substantially reduced by using a single Gibbs-sampling trajectory. After a single burn-in period, we interleave coherent measurements that satisfy detailed balance with respect to the target Gibbs state. The efficiency of this approach rests on the fact that, in many settings, the autocorrelation time can be significantly shorter than the mixing time. For energy estimation (and more generally for observables commuting with the Hamiltonian), we implement the required measurements using Gaussian-filtered quantum phase estimation with only logarithmic overhead. We also introduce a weighted operator Fourier transform technique to mitigate measurement-induced disturbance for general observables.

Abstract: We present a rigorous and comprehensive classification of the asymptotic behavior of time-quasiperiodic Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equations under the assumption of Hermitian jump operators. Our main contributions are twofold: first, we establish a criterion for the uniqueness of steady states. The criterion is formulated in terms of the algebra generated by the GKSL generators and provides a necessary and sufficient condition when the generators are analytic functions of time. We demonstrate the utility of our criterion through prototypical examples, including quantum many-body spin chains. Second, we extend the concept of strong symmetry for time-dependent GKSL equations by introducing two distinct forms, strong symmetry in the Schrödinger picture and that in the interaction picture, and completely classify the asymptotic dynamics with them. More concretely, we rigorously uncover that the strong symmetry in the interaction picture is responsible for non-trivial time-dependent steady states, such as coherent oscillations, whereas that in the Schrödinger picture controls the existence of time-independent steady states. This classification not only encompasses established mechanisms underlying non-trivial oscillatory steady states, such as strong dynamical symmetry and Floquet dynamical symmetry, but also reveals symmetry-predicted, time-dependent asymptotic dynamics in a novel class of open quantum systems. Our framework thus provides a rigorous foundation for controlling dissipative quantum systems in a time-dependent manner.

Abstract: We establish a systematic classification scheme for multipartite entanglement structures. We define Sperner states -- a broad class of states where apparent multipartite entanglement decomposes into fewer-partite entanglement among subsystems of each party. Each class of Sperner states is associated with one antichain hypergraph and each hypergraph encodes the maximal entanglement structure permissible under its constraints. We introduce a Multi-entanglement Measure Space (MEMS) where each Sperner class corresponds to a linear subspace defined by the vanishing of specific linear combinations of bipartite and multipartite measures. The nonvanishing of such combinations signals multipartite entanglement beyond the associated hypergraph, thereby distinguishing entanglement structures. We build a two way connection between each hypergraph entanglement structure and a distinct set of combinations, thereby quantifying the entanglement pattern and providing a unified basis for classifying all multipartite entanglement.

Abstract: Floquet quantum error-correcting codes provide an operationally economical route to fault tolerance by dynamically generating stabilizer structures using only two-body Pauli measurements. But while it is well established that stabilizer codes in higher spatial dimensions gain additional levels of intrinsic robustness, higher-dimensional Floquet codes have hitherto been explored only in limited scope. Here we introduce a 3d generalization of a Floquet code whose instantaneous stabilizer group realizes a 3d fermionic toric code, while crucially preserving all three logical qubits throughout the entire measurement sequence. One central ingredient is the identification of a 3d lattice geometry that generalizes the features of the Kekulé lattice underlying the 2d Hastings-Haah code - specifically, a structure where deleting any one edge color yields a two-color subgraph that decomposes into short, closed loops rather than homologically nontrivial chains. This loop property avoids the collapse of logical information that plagues naive sequential two-color measurement schedules on many 3d lattices. Although, for our lattice geometry, a simple 3-round cycle that sequentially measures the three types of parity checks does not expose the full error syndrome set, we show that one can append a measurement sequence to extract the missing syndromes without disturbing the logical subspace. Beyond code design, 3d tricoordinated lattice geometries define a family of 3d monitored Kitaev models, in which random measurements of the non-commuting parity checks give rise to dynamically created entangled phases with nontrivial topology. In discussing the general structure of their underlying phase diagrams and, in particular, the existence of certain quantum critical points, we again make a connection to the general preservation of logical information in time-ordered Floquet protocols.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning in cloud environments requires protecting sensitive data while enabling remote computation. Here we demonstrate the first realistic implementations of a perfectly-secure quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) scheme applied to quantum neural networks (QNN). Using efficient Clifford+$T$ decomposition, we implement quantum convolutional neural networks for two complementary scenarios: (i) reverse delegated training, where encrypted data from multiple providers trains a user's network via federated aggregation; (ii) private inference, where users process encrypted data with remote quantum networks. Moreover, analysis of server circuit privacy reveals probabilistic model protection through Pauli gate concealment. These results establish perfectly-secure QHE as a practical framework for multi-party quantum machine learning.

Abstract: A quantum backflow state refers to a quantum state exhibiting negative probability density flux albeit a completely positive momentum spectrum. Extending earlier work that uses single laser pulse to prepare quantum backflow state in an ultracold atomic BEC [1], we theoretical investigated flexible quantum backflow state preparation via large momentum transfer technique, which to our knowledge, has not been studied before. By combining atom interferometry theory and non-interacting BEC wave function, we solve for the evolution of a BEC wavepacket under atom interferometry sequence. Simulation results show a highly tunable backflow flux and critical density under our scheme, and can be manipulated to go beyond existing numbers.

Abstract: Packages capable of supporting large arrays of high-coherence superconducting qubits are vital for the realisation of fault-tolerant quantum computers and the necessary high-throughput metrology required to optimise fabrication and manufacturing processes. We present a wafer-scale packaging architecture supporting over 500 qubits on a single 3-inch die. The package is engineered to suppress parasitic RF modes, and to mitigate material loss through simulation-informed design while managing differential thermal contraction to ensure robust operation at millikelvin temperatures. System-level heat-load calculations from a large wiring payload show this package may be operated in commercial dilution refrigerators. Measurements of the qubits loaded into the package show median $T_1$, $T_{2e} \sim 100~μ$s ($\sim$100 qubits) alongside readout with median fidelity of 97.5% (54 qubits) and a median qubit temperature of 36 mK (54 qubits). These results validate the performance of these packages and demonstrate that large-scale integration can be achieved without compromising device performance. Finally, we highlight the utility of these packages as a tool for high throughput feedback on qubit figures of merit over large sample sizes, allowing identification of performance outliers in the tails of the coherence distribution, a critical capability for informing fabrication and manufacture of high-quality quantum qubits and quantum processors.

Abstract: The temperature sensitivity of a probe in equilibrium can be gauged by its thermal quantum Fisher information (QFI). It is known that probes exhibiting degeneracy in their energy-level structure can achieve larger sensitivities, while probes with a more uniform spectrum may remain sensitive over a broader temperature range. Here, we study the thermometric performance of a multilevel quantum Rabi model in which two well-separated atomic manifolds of near-degenerate levels couple to a single cavity mode. We generalise the standard quantum Rabi treatment in the adiabatic regime to find an approximate closed-form expression for the thermal QFI. We then characterise two complementary limits. On the one hand, a large dark-state manifold (dark-manifold saturation) produces a robust peak in thermal sensitivity due to bright--dark population transfer. Such increase in sensitivity is further maximised at an intermediate light--matter coupling strength. Maximising instead the number of bright states (bright-manifold saturation) generates a broadband thermal response that becomes increasingly stable under random light--matter couplings as the number of levels is increased. The rich spectral structure of our cavity-QED model thus makes it a versatile and sensitive equilibrium thermometer over a broad range of temperatures.

Abstract: We present a technique for measuring ion temperature using cavity-based electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) applicable for cavity-qed systems in the strong coupling regime. This method enables efficient extraction of the ion's phonon occupation number following sub-Doppler cooling close to the motional ground state. The proposed method relies on monitoring the cavity probe transmission while scanning the probe laser frequency once cavity EIT is established using the control beam, significantly simplifying the measurement procedure. We theoretically establish a model that demonstrates influence of thermal state of the trapped ion vis a vis the EIT linewidth measured. We show how the cavity EIT transmission may be used as a thermometry tool to deduce the ion temperature as well as the motional state for an ion in the sub-Doppler cooling regime. The current method can only be used for operation in the resolved-sideband regime, where individual motional states can be selectively addressed for all relevant transitions either by selecting appropriate energy levels for the three-level system or by employing strong confinement with high secular frequencies ($\sim 10 MHz$).

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing hinges on efficient logical compilation, in particular, translating high-level circuits into code-compatible implementations. Gate-by-gate compilation often yields deep circuits, requiring significant overhead to ensure fault-tolerance. As an alternative, we investigate the compilation of primitives from quantum simulation as single blocks. We focus our study on the [[n,n-2,2]] code family, which allows for the exhaustive comparison of potential compilation primitives on small circuit instances. Based upon that, we then introduce a methodology that lifts these primitives into size-invariant, depth-efficient compilation strategies. This recovers known methods for circuits with moderate Hadamard counts and yields improved realizations for sparse and dense placements. Simulations show significant error-rate reductions in the compiled circuits. We envision the approach as a core component of peephole-based compilers. Its flexibility and low hand-crafting burden make it readily extensible to other circuit structures and code families.

Abstract: Polar molecules, with their rich internal structure, offer immense potential for fundamental physics, quantum technology, and controlled chemistry. However, their utilization is currently limited because of slow and imperfect state detection and weak dipolar interaction, limiting fast and large-scale entanglement generation. We propose and analyze a scheme for quantum logic control and measurement-based state preparation in a hybrid platform of polar molecules and neutral atoms. The method leverages fast, high-fidelity atom-molecule gates and high-fidelity atomic ancilla measurements to overcome the common challenges in molecule-only platforms, while preserving their diverse structural advantages. The proposed atom-molecule controlled-phase gate is based on resonant dipole-dipole exchange between a molecular rotational transition and an atomic Rydberg transition, rendering it three orders of magnitude faster than any direct molecule-molecule entangling gate. We further study several applications of our scheme including the preparation of molecular GHZ states for quantum enhanced precision measurements, the preparation of exotic molecular qudit states with topological order, and measurement-altered criticality. Our scheme is applicable to any polar molecule. It expands the paradigm of quantum logic control and paves the way to large-scale molecular entangled states. More generally, it highlights a concrete hybrid quantum system in which each qubit is utilized in an optimal way and where the measurement-based approach can yield a significant advantage in near-term devices.

Abstract: Most quantum metrology protocols harness highly entangled probe states and globally accessible measurements to surpass the standard quantum limit. However, it is challenging to satisfy these requirements in realistic many-body sensors. We demonstrate that both of these constraints can be overcome in quantum chaotic sensors. Crucially, we establish that even in the presence of partial measurement accessibility, chaotic dynamics enables initial unentangled states to exhibit Heisenberg scaling of the quantum Fisher information, $I_α$ with time. In the weakly chaotic regime, we identify spin-coherent states placed at the edge of the regular islands in the mixed classical phase space as optimal initial states for enhanced sensitivity. On the other hand, in the strongly chaotic regime, $I_α$ is insensitive to the choice of the initial state. Notably, quantum-enhanced sensitivity is achieved even when a very low fraction ($\sim 5\%$) of the qubits are accessible. These results establish quantum chaos as a robust resource for quantum-enhanced sensing under realistic accessibility constraints on accessibility.

Abstract: We present an effective potential that allows quantum thermal expectation values of a position-dependent observable to be estimated as a classical ensemble average of the corresponding function. We follow the approach of Feynman and Hibbs, but perform the mean-field treatment of quantum fluctuations about the path starting point rather than the path centroid. Furthermore, rather than performing a full variational optimization of the potential, we explore approximate functional forms that yield a numerical robustness. The resulting closed-form potential is exact in the classical and harmonic limits; benchmarks against exact position distributions for one-dimensional quartic, Morse, and double-well potentials, show good agreement for potentials with harmonic support.

A wide variety of applications are currently being developed for scientific and technological purposes, however, most research relies on the use of highly entangled resource states that are challenging to generate and control in a given physical system. Here, we study the use of weighted graph states as more accessible resources for quantum metrology, which yield a favorable precision beyond the classical limit, approaching the Heisenberg limit. We find a notable robustness to variation in weights and less challenging weight requirements compared to standard graph states, which require a maximal weight at all edges. Both of these aspects reduce the practical demands in a physical setup, with the latter implying significantly less entanglement is required to gain a quantum advantage in metrology. We study the quantum Fisher information and optimized estimator variance of two identified sub classes of weighted graph states for an arbitrary number of N qubits, providing analytical forms and investigating their scaling. Our work opens up opportunities for using weakly entangled states in quantum-enhanced metrology.

Abstract: We present a quantum reservoir computing (QRC) framework based on a small-scale quantum system comprising at most six interacting qubits, designed for nonlinear financial time-series forecasting. We apply the model to predict future daily closing trading volumes of 20 quantum-sector publicly traded companies over the period from April 11, 2020, to April 11, 2025, as well as minute-by-minute trading volumes during out-of-market hours on July 7, 2025. Our analysis identifies optimal reservoir parameters that yield stock trend (up/down) classification accuracies exceeding $86 \%$. Importantly, the QRC model is platform-agnostic and can be realized across diverse physical implementations of qubits, including superconducting circuits and trapped ions. These results demonstrate the expressive power and robustness of small-scale quantum reservoirs for modeling complex temporal correlations in financial data, highlighting their potential applicability to real-world forecasting tasks on near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: A fundamental question asks how uniformly finite sets of pure quantum states can be distributed in a Hilbert space. The Welch bounds address this question, and are saturated by $k$-designs, i.e. sets of states reproducing the $k$-th Haar moments. However, these bounds quickly become uninformative when the number of states is below that required for an exact $k$-design. We derive strengthened Welch-type inequalities that remain sharp in this regime by exploiting rank constraints from partial transposition and spectral properties of the partially transposed Haar moment operator. We prove that the deviation from the Welch bound captures the average-case approximation error, hence characterizing a natural notion of minimum achievable error at fixed cardinality. For $k=3$, we prove that SICs and complete MUB sets saturate our bounds, making them optimal approximate 3-designs of their cardinality. This leads a natural variational criterion to rule out the existence of a complete set MUBs, which we use to obtain numerical evidence against such set in dimension $6$. As a key technical ingredient, we compute the complete spectrum of the partially transposed symmetric-subspace projector, including multiplicities and eigenvectors, which may find applications beyond the present work.

Abstract: Pauli channels are widely used to describe errors in quantum computers, particularly when noise is shaped via Pauli twirling. A common assumption is that such channels admit a Markovian generator, namely a Pauli-Lindblad model with non-negative rates, but the validity of this assumption has not been systematically examined. Here, using CP-indivisibility as our criterion for non-Markovianity, we study multi-qubit Pauli channels from a single snapshot of the dynamics. We find that while the generator always has the same structure as the standard Pauli-Lindblad model, the rates may be negative or complex. We show that random Pauli channels are almost always non-Markovian, with the probability of encountering a negative rate converging doubly exponentially to unity with the number of qubits. For physically motivated noise models shaped by Pauli twirling, including single-qubit over-rotations and two-qubit amplitude damping errors, we find that negative rates are generic, even when the underlying physical noise is Markovian. We generalize probabilistic error amplification and cancellation to non-Markovian generators, and quantify the sampling overhead introduced by negative and complex rates. Experiments on superconducting qubits confirm that allowing negative rates in the learned noise model yields more accurate predictions than restricting to non-negative rates.

Abstract: The Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) provides the standard starting point for strong-coupling thermodynamics, yet explicit operator forms are known only in restricted settings. We present a quenched density framework that uses the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to rewrite the reduced equilibrium state as an average over local propagators in imaginary time. This approach rigorously separates the statistical definition of the environment from the algebraic structure of the system response. We apply this framework to the minimal case of a harmonic environment with a coupling commuting with the system Hamiltonian. In this scenario the correction to the HMF has an exact, closed-form expression. We validate this result against finite-bath trace-out calculations and stochastic imaginary-time sampling in a five-level projector-coupled model.

Abstract: We report the results of magnetotransport experiments carried out on low-disorder 2D hole gases (2DHG) in the strongly correlated liquid regime, hosted in dopant-free (100) GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunctions. Over a wide range of 2DHG densities (from 0.7 $\times$ 10$^{15}$/m$^2$ to $2 \times 10^{15}$/m$^2$), Fourier analysis of low-field (B < 1 T) Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations reveals two spin-orbit-split heavy-hole (HH) subbands with distinct effective masses contributing to transport. Surprisingly, the lighter-mass HH subband exhibits a parabolic dispersion with Fermi wavevector below the anticrossing between the heavy-hole and light-hole subbands, while the heavier HH subband is non-parabolic throughout. Quantitative comparison with numerical calculations based on the Luttinger model reveals that both effective masses are enhanced by a common factor ($\approx$ 2.3), which we attribute to many-body interactions. This common scaling factor has a very weak dependence on the 2DHG density, likely due to band hybridization. Our measured hole masses are compared with published cyclotron resonance and magnetotransport values. We propose a cohesive framework reconciling the long-standing three-way discrepancy between Luttinger theory, magnetotransport, and cyclotron resonance measurements of density-dependent effective masses in partially spin-orbit-polarized heavy-hole systems in GaAs.

Abstract: We theoretically study the effects of magnonic Kerr nonlinearity on magnon-polaritons (MPs) with a soft-mode in easy-axis ferromagnets coupled to a microwave cavity. Using an effective circuit model capable of describing MPs up to the nonperturbative strong-coupling regime, we show that chaotic and frequency-comb-like behaviors of MPs emerge at the original modes crossing point. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Kerr nonlinearity induces a finite excitation gap in the soft-mode, particularly in the strong-coupling regime.

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the nonlinear magneto-optical shift conductivity in the surface states of the prototypical topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ under a perpendicular quantizing magnetic field. By describing the electronic states as Landau levels and using a perturbative approach, we derive the microscopic expression for the shift conductivity $σ^{(2);αβγ}(-ω,ω)$, where $α,β,γ=\pm$ stand for the circular polarization of light and $ω$ is the light frequency; the spectra are further decomposed into contributions from the interband and intraband optical transitions, for which the selection rules are identified. Considering that the system possesses $C_3$ point group of symmetry, the nonzero components of the conductivity tensor are $σ^{(2);-++}=[σ^{(2);+--}]^\ast$. Therefore, a pure circularly polarized light generates zero shift current. In the clean limit, the conductivities are nonzero only for discrete photon energies because of the discrete Landau levels and energy conservation, and they become Lorentzian lineshapes with the inclusion of damping, which relaxes the condition of energy conservation. The dependence of the spectra on the damping parameters, the magnetic fields, and the chemical potentials is investigated in detail. Our results reveal that the shift current is highly tunable by the chemical potential and the magnetic field. These results underscore the potential of topological insulators for tunable, strong nonlinear magneto-optical applications.

Abstract: We study crossed Andreev reflection occurring in quantum dots connected to one superconducting lead and two normal leads at low temperatures $T$. Specifically, we derive an exact formula for the conductance up to order $T^2$ in the large superconducting gap limit, which is expressed in terms of the transmission probabilities of Cooper pairs and interacting Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Our formulation is based on the latest version of Fermi-liquid theory for the Anderson impurity model, which has clarified the quasiparticle energy shifts of order $ω^2$ and $T^2$ -- that is, corrections of the same order as those arising from the finite lifetime of quasiparticles -- can be exactly taken into account through three-body correlations of impurity electrons. We also demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve and affect the Cooper-pair tunneling as the Andreev level moves away from the Fermi level, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The results demonstrate that the Cooper-pair contribution to the $T^2$ term of the nonlocal conductance becomes comparable to the Bogoliubov-quasiparticle contribution in the parameter region where superconducting proximity effects dominate over the Kondo effect.

Abstract: The discovery of critical points that can host quantized nonlocal order parameters and degenerate edge modes relocate the study of symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs) to gapless regions. In this letter, we reveal gapless SPTs (gSPTs) in systems tuned out-of-equilibrium by periodic drivings and non-Hermitian couplings. Focusing on one-dimensional models with sublattice symmetry, we introduce winding numbers by applying the Cauchy's argument principle to generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ), yielding unified topological characterizations and bulk-edge correspondence in both gapped phases and at gapless critical points. The theory is demonstrated in a broad class of Floquet bipartite lattices, unveiling unique topological criticality of non-Hermitian Floquet origin. Our findings identify gSPTs in driven open systems and uncover robust topological edge modes at phase transitions beyond equilibrium.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the plasmon modes of alternating-twist multilayer graphene. In multilayer systems, interlayer coupling gives rise to distinctive plasmon modes, but calculations in moiré systems remain challenging due to their complex tunneling structures. Using the Kac-Murdock-Szegő Toeplitz formalism, we derive that the in-phase mode exhibits the conventional $\sqrt{q}$ behavior, while the out-of-phase modes acquire plasmon gaps determined by specific interband transitions between Dirac cones with different velocities in the long-wavelength limit. We demonstrate that these out-of-phase modes remain undamped in the weak Coulomb-interaction limit when the twist angle exceeds a critical value ($θ\gtrsim 2.75^\circ$ for the alternating-twist trilayer case), regardless of the carrier density as long as the low-energy effective Dirac Hamiltonian remains valid. Furthermore, we consider the effect of a perpendicular electric field, and demonstrate how plasmon modes can be tuned by a gate voltage.

Abstract: We provide a systematic framework to investigate the magnetoplasmons of multilayer two-dimensional electron systems by using the Kac--Murdock--Szegő (KMS) Toeplitz matrix to consider interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of interlayer tunneling, we show that the single-layer magnetoplasmon branch splits into $N$ collective modes -- one in-phase mode and $N-1$ out-of-phase modes -- and derive their asymptotic behaviors in the long-wavelength limit, as well as in the limit of large layer separation and strong magnetic fields. When interlayer tunneling is present, we clarify the magnetoplasmon dispersion, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by identifying the magnetoplasmon mode associated with each interband transition, as well as tunneling magnetoplasmons arising from interband transitions with the same Landau level index. Our study presents the hybridization between the modes governed by underlying symmetries, along with an enhanced tunneling magnetoplasmon gap exceeding the associated interband gap. The KMS-based analytic formalism thus provides a comprehensive physical understanding of magnetoplasmons in multilayer structures.

Abstract: Charging energy ($E_C$) is essential in quantum dot (QD) devices. Previous studies on PbTe QDs have reported both the presence and absence of $E_C$. To resolve this ambiguity, we vary the QD size, i.e. the cross-sectional area of PbTe nanowires, and track the evolution of $E_C$. For large crosssectional areas ($\sim$ 16000 nm$^2$), the PbTe QDs exhibit no measurable $E_C$, while quantized levels are well resolved. Decreasing this area successively to 5000, 1500, and 500 nm$^2$, $E_C$ becomes finite and increases to 80, 160, and 210 $μ$eV, respectively. We further demonstrate the strong tunability of local gates, which can tune the PbTe device from the QD regime to the regime of ballistic transport. These results address concerns regarding the large dielectric constant of PbTe and provide key insights in engineering advanced PbTe quantum devices.

Abstract: The dispersion curves for the electrons and holes in CsPbI$_3$ in the orthorhombic phase are calculated using the density functional theory (DFT), with the spin-orbit coupling taken into account. The effective masses of the charge carriers are obtained using the parabolic approximation of the dispersion curves in different directions in the $k$-space. It is found that the dispersion curves demonstrate strong nonparabolicity at energies above 0.2 eV for electrons and above 0.1 eV for holes, available for experimental study by the means of optical spectroscopy. We propose a model that describes the dispersion dependences of charge carriers at those energies, where the effective masses of the quasiparticles depend quadratically on the wave vector. An expression is obtained according to the model, which can accurately approximate the dispersion curves for the electron and the hole in all symmetric directions from the center to the boundary of the Brillouin zone.

Abstract: Strong light fields have unlocked previously unthinkable possibilities to tailor coherent electron trajectories, engineer band structures and shape emergent phases of matter all-optically. Unravelling the underlying quantum mechanisms requires a visualisation of the lightwave-driven electron motion directly in the band structure. While photoelectron momentum microscopy has imaged optically excited electrons averaged over many cycles of light, actual subcycle band-structure videography has been limited to small electron momenta. Yet lightwave-driven elementary processes in quantum materials often occur throughout momentum space. Here, we introduce attosecond-precision, subcycle band-structure videography covering the entire first Brillouin zone (BZ) and visualize one of the most fundamental but notoriously elusive strong-field processes: non-adiabatic Landau-Zener-Majorana (LZM) tunnelling. The interplay of field-driven acceleration within the Dirac-like band structure of graphene and periodic LZM interband tunnelling manifest in a coherent displacement and distortion of the momentum distribution at the BZ edge. The extremely non-thermal electron distributions also allow us to disentangle competing scattering processes and assess their impact on coherent electronic control through electron redistribution and thermalization. Our panoramic view of strong-field-driven electron motion in quantum materials lays the foundation for a microscopic understanding of some of the most discussed light-driven phenomena in condensed matter physics.

Abstract: We proof the non-renormalization of the Hall viscosity by Coulomb interactions for integer and fractional quantum Hall Jain states building on previous results obtained for the Hall conductivity. We employ Wigner-Weyl calculus in order to represent the Hall viscosity in terms of a topological invariant comprised of Green functions and work within the composite fermion field theory model of Jain states of the fractional quantum Hall fluid presented by Lopez and Fradkin. The topological expression is first derived within the free field theory of electrons and explicitly calculated for this case as well as in the mean field approximation of the composite fermion theory Jain states. The topological orbital spin of composite fermions distinguishes their mean field treatment from that of electrons resulting in an additional topological contribution. We then argue that the introduction of Coulomb interactions does not lead to perturbative corrections of the Hall viscosity in both integer and fractional quantum Hall fluids. The proof relies on the assumptions of homogeneity and rotational invariance of an underlying sample modulo the vector potential giving rise to the homogeneous external magnetic field. These conditions imply a Hall viscosity per emergent quasiparticle number density quantized in units of one half times the average quasiparticle orbital spin or one quarter times the Wen-Zee shift. The latter features a contribution from the composite fermion topological orbital spin relative to that of electrons.

Abstract: Recent works have shown how the electrical properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) show a size-dependence in terms of resistivity, charge neutrality point (CNP) and band structure once their widths drop below approximately 50 nm. It has been observed that the CNP switches sign below a certain GNR width, and in this article, we explore this via computational modelling of the electric field and the conductance of GNRs in the presence of an AFM tip. We show that CNP is expected to shift towards lower values as GNR width reduces as a result of the significantly enhanced electric field around edges, but that a change in sign is not expected. We also show experimentally via high-resolution Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) that there does not appear to be any significant difference between the edges and the bulk of a GNR, indicating that the switch in CNP is not due to differential doping, and may instead be due to variations in the band structure as a function of size.

Abstract: We study a variant of the Haldane honeycomb model that has non-reciprocal hoppings between the next-nearest neighbours. The system on a torus hosts time-reversal symmetry protected exceptional rings(ER) in the spectrum. The ERs act as Berry-curvature flux tubes i.e the Berry curvature is non-zero only inside the ERs. The system on a cylinder having zig-zag boundaries (and transverse momentum $k_x$) hosts edge-states that have zero group velocity at $k_x=π$ and are therefore `non-chiral'. The edge states undergo a bifurcation transition at an exceptional point(EP)in the BZ and delocalise into the bulk. As the non-reciprocity is increased, the bulk states that are approaching each other are converted into pairs of EPs due to non-Hermiticity. As the non-reciprocity is further increased, there is a `Russian doll'-like nested proliferation of pairs of EPs, leading to an EP-cascade. The proliferation of EPs takes place only at specific values of the non-hermiticity parameter, leading to a step-like structure in the EP-pair density when plotted as a function of non-Hermiticity. Further, using wave packet dynamics, we find a tunable regime where the non-chiral edge states can be dynamically stabilised for large timescales. The `self-acceleration' term in the equations of motion tends to diffuse the wave packets into the bulk, thus making them `ephemeral edge states'. But we find that for small non-hermiticity, the edge localisation is stabilised until late times for sufficiently wider wave packets. Thus, we have brought forth an intriguing phenomenology of the exceptional phase of the non-reciprocal Haldane model, which may bear direct relevance for systems such as disordered Kitaev honeycomb model, wherein such ERs have been predicted.

Abstract: We propose and investigate a novel two-dimensional (2D) tight-binding model defined on a diamond-dodecagon lattice geometry that hosts multiple flat bands (FBs) and supports topological phase transitions driven by a magnetic flux. This lattice exhibits three completely flat, non-dispersive bands in the band structure in the absence of magnetic flux due to destructive interference in the electron hoppings, leading to the emergence of compact localized states (CLS). These CLS are analytically constructed and exhibit real-space confinement of the electrons, arising solely due to the lattice's geometrical frustration. It has been shown that these FBs are very robust against the introduction of weak random onsite disorder in the system. By tuning the uniform magnetic flux threaded through the diamond plaquettes, we demonstrate a tunable evolution of the band structure and show that certain bands develop nontrivial topological features with nonzero integer values of the Chern number. Additionally, we have computed the multi-terminal transport properties for this 2D lattice system, which display the flux-tunable resonances and transmission suppression linked to the FBs, establishing a clear interplay between the localization, topology, and transport. Our findings put forward the diamond-dodecagon lattice as a robust and tunable platform for studying the flat-band physics and magnetic flux-controlled topological phenomena, offering promising experimental feasibility in photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems.

Abstract: Correlation functions and correlation lengths are frequently used to describe phase transitions in quantum systems, but they require an explicit choice of observables. The recently introduced information lattice instead provides an observable-independent way to identify where and at which scale information is contained in quantum lattice models. Here, we use it to study the difference between the metallic and insulating regime of one-dimensional tight-binding chains. We find that the information per scale follows a power law in metals at low temperature and that Friedel-like oscillations are visible in the information lattice. At high temperature or in insulators at low temperature, the information per scale decays exponentially. Thus, the information lattice is a useful tool for analyzing the metal-insulator transition.

Abstract: The recent discovery of robust quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has established a highly versatile platform for correlated topological matter. This review synthesizes the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these interaction-driven topological phases. Experimentally, the landscape has rapidly expanded from initial Chern insulators in trilayer systems to fully quantized QAH states in thicker systems. Theoretically, it is believed that moiré potential and electron-electron interaction cooperate and produce the QAH effect in such systems. Theoretical calculations also bring interesting questions, such as the formation of an interaction-driven topological phase known as an anomalous Hall crystal (AHC). This review comprehensively covers the experimental hallmarks, the theoretical frameworks, including continuum models and many-body approaches, and the ensuing physical picture that reconciles the roles of interactions, displacement fields, and the moiré potentials. We conclude by outlining outstanding open questions and future directions, positioning RMG/hBN systems at the forefront of topological quantum matter.

Abstract: Identifying whether a many-body ground state is gapped or gapless is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially in quantum spin liquids. In this work, we develop a gap-diagnostic scheme based on the polarization amplitude defined via a twist operator, evaluated within the infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) framework. As a benchmark, analysis of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain demonstrates that the polarization amplitude clearly distinguishes the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid from the gapped Néel phase. We then extend this framework to infinite cylinders of the spin-$1/2$ XY-$J_χ$ model on the square lattice. We find that the polarization amplitude sharply detects the transition between the gapless XY phase and the gapped chiral spin liquid phase. These results show that polarization amplitudes provide a strong energy-gap diagnostic in two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum spin liquids.

Abstract: We analyze the magnetization curve of the spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg model in a magnetic field. Using state-of-the-art variational wavefunctions based on neural networks, we confirm the presence of robust magnetization plateaus at $m=1/3$, $5/9$ and $7/9$ of the saturation value, stabilized by a spontaneous symmetry breaking of lattice translations with a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ unit cell. Regarding the more challenging $m=1/9$ plateau, we find two competing valence bond crystals depending on the system size, both breaking translation as well as point group symmetries and with a larger $3\times 3$ unit cell. Such quantum states with local modulations of the magnetization average values could be observed experimentally in the near future.

Abstract: The earlier theory [1] of the quantum phase transitions related to the change of the Fermi Surface Topology (FST) is advanced. For such transitions the Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold determined by the Lee-Yang zeros, the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ as the $d$-volume of the Fermi sea, and the special FST universality class were introduced in [1]. The exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) $d$-dimensional ($d=1,2,3$) model of interacting fermions is analyzed. We explore the relation between the Lee-Yang zeros, the Luttinger and the plateau (Oshikawa) theorems. The validity of the Luttinger theorem in the HK model is confirmed. It is shown that the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ and the FST universality class describe the transitions between metal and band/Mott insulators, as well as the Lifshitz and van Hove gapless-to-gapless transitions. The gapless phases are established to be the Landau Fermi liquids (metals). In addition to the conventional paradigm with a continuous order parameter, we apply the homology theory to analyze the FST transitions. They are critical points of the Morse function. To quantify FST we use the Euler characteristic, which is calculated for each phase of the HK model. We claim that the FST universality class is robust with respect to interactions and other model details, under the condition that the critical points are non-degenerate.

Abstract: Energy flows among coupled subsystems are essential for ultrafast dynamics and high-speed technologies. In magnetic materials, spin fluctuations -- magnons -- mediate these flows in ultrafast magnetism. Yet momentum-resolved access to low-energy magnons governing the microscopic dynamics has been lacking. Using time-resolved resonant diffuse scattering alongside complementary time-resolved X-ray techniques and quantum-kinetic simulations, we unveil the hierarchical energy pathways among correlated systems in the photoexcited antiferromagnet CuO. Above-bandgap excitation triggers near-instantaneous spin disorder, generating non-thermal magnons throughout reciprocal space within femtoseconds. Real-time momentum-resolved tracking reveals picosecond magnon quasi-thermalization, followed by nanosecond recovery via momentum-selective magnon-phonon scattering. The quasiparticle dispersion mismatch creates recovery bottlenecks that control non-equilibrium lifetimes. This microscopic framework transcends phenomenological models and generalizes across materials, establishing design principles for ultrafast control of material properties.

Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a resonant level model coupled to a strongly interacting electron bath modeled by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Different from the well-investigated case of a structureless non-interacting Fermi gas bath leading to a temperature-independent exponential decay of the impurity orbital occupation, we find a temperature-dependent oscillatory decay. We attribute this difference to the lack of quasiparticles in the SYK model, which is reflected in its singular density of states at the Fermi level. Our results are exact and can be obtained analytically by mapping to a suitably structured Fermi gas bath as an ancillary model for the SYK bath.

Abstract: We present a rigorous derivation of the orbital magnetization for interacting electrons within the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. Our method also allows us to derive formulas for the orbital magnetic susceptibility. The results are expressed entirely in terms of the self-consistent wavefunctions and the Hartree-Fock energy spectrum at zero magnetic field. We find that the formula for the orbital magnetization is the same as in the non-interacting case, provided that the Hamiltonian and Bloch wave functions are replaced by their Hartree-Fock counterparts. By contrast, the orbital magnetic susceptibility contains an additional interaction-induced contribution that cannot be obtained by such a replacement. We test the formulas on an interacting Rashba model, finding an agreement with calculations performed at a small but non-zero external magnetic field.

Abstract: We investigate measurement-induced localization in a continuously monitored one-dimensional Aubry--André--Harper model, focusing on the quantum Zeno regime in which the measurements dominate coherent dynamics. The presence of a quasiperiodic potential renders the problem analytically tractable and enables a controlled study of the interplay between monitoring and disorder. We develop an analytical description based on an instantaneous Schrödinger equation with a measurement-induced effective potential constructed self-consistently from individual quantum trajectories, without relying on postselection. In the quantum Zeno regime, an emergent dominant energy scale reduces the problem to a transfer-matrix formulation of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which allows direct computation of the Lyapunov exponent. Complementarily, we extract the localization length numerically from long-time steady-state quantum state diffusion trajectories by reconstructing the intrinsic localized single-particle wave functions and analyzing their spatial decay. These numerical results show quantitative agreement with the effective theory predictions, with controlled corrections of order $J^2/[λ^2+(γ/2)^2]$ (where $J$ is the hopping amplitude, $γ$ the measurement strength, and $λ$ the quasiperiodic potential). Our results underscore the connection between the effective non-Hermitian description and the stochastic monitored dynamics, showing the interplay between Zeno-like localization, coherent hopping, and quasiperiodic-disorder-induced localization, while also laying the groundwork for understanding and exploiting measurement-induced localization as a tool for quantum control and state preparation.

Abstract: The transition to global synchronization in coupled dynamical systems is governed by the interplay between coupling strength and structural topology. Although abrupt, first-order-like synchronization transitions have been extensively reported in heterogeneous networks, it is unclear whether comparable accelerated onset behavior can emerge purely from coordination geometry in spatially homogeneous, regular lattices. In this study, we investigate large-scale ($N=10^5$) stochastic Stuart-Landau oscillator networks defined on regular lattices with controlled coordination number. Using topological data analysis (TDA), simplicial-complex characterization, and optimal-transport-based geometric diagnostics, we identify a coordination-controlled crossover in synchronization onset dynamics at approximately $z_{c} \approx 7$ within the class of regular lattices considered. Low-coordination lattices ($z < z_{c}$) exhibit persistent $H_2$ topological features in the dynamical amplitude field that correlate with delayed coherence and surface-limited propagation. In contrast, higher-coordination lattices ($z > z_{c}$) display rapid fragmentation of these features, reduced interface roughness, and predominantly positive Ricci curvature. This is consistent with enhanced path redundancy and improved transport efficiency. In this regime, the global order parameter exhibits accelerated exponential-like growth during the onset stage. Throughout this work, abrupt synchronization refers specifically to this exponential onset behavior rather than to thermodynamic first-order hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that increasing coordination density induces a qualitative reorganization of higher-order topological structure that strongly correlates with synchronization efficiency in regular lattice systems.

Abstract: Diffusion-driven instability is a fundamental mechanism underlying pattern formation in spatially extended systems. In almost all existing works, diffusion across the links of the underlying network is modeled through scalar weights, possibly complemented by cross-diffusion terms that are homogeneous across links. In this work, we investigate the emergence of Turing patterns on Matrix Weighted Networks (MWNs), a recently introduced framework in which each edge is associated with a matrix weight. Focusing on the class of coherent MWNs, we provide a novel characterization of coherence in terms of node-dependent orthonormal matrices, showing that link transformations can be written as relative rotations between nodes. This representation allows us to deal with coherent MWNs of any size and to introduce an orthonormal change of variables capable to reduce diffusion on a coherent MWN to diffusion on a standard weighted network with scalar weights. Building on this, we extend the classical Turing instability analysis to MWNs and derive the conditions under which a homogeneous equilibrium of the local dynamics loses stability due to matrix-weighted diffusion. Our results show how network topology, scalar weights, and inter-node transformations jointly shape pattern formation, and provide a constructive framework to analyze and design Turing patterns on matrix-weighted and higher-order networked systems.

Abstract: How much work does it cost for a propelled particle to stay localised near a stationary target, defying both thermal noise and a constant flow that would carry it away? We study the control of such a particle in finite time and find optimal protocols for time-dependent swim velocity and diffusivity, without feedback. Accuracy, quantified via the mean squared deviation from the target, and energetic cost turn out to be related by a trade-off, which complements the one between precision and cost known in stochastic thermodynamics. We show that accuracy better than a certain threshold requires active driving, which comes at a cost that increases with accuracy. The optimal protocols have discontinuous swim velocity and diffusivity, switching between a passive drift state with vanishing diffusivity and an active propulsion state. This study highlights how a time-dependent diffusivity enhances optimal control and sets benchmarks for cost and accuracy of artificial self-propelled particles navigating noisy environments.

Abstract: Roughly twenty reports (as of 2025) of time-reversal-symmetry breaking (TRSB) states in low critical temperature (T$_c$) superconducting (SC), otherwise conventional Fermi liquid, metals have emerged primarily from muon spin relaxation ($μ$SR) data. The detected fields, inferred from the current interpretation of depolarization data, are similar in magnitude and not far above the lower limit of detection, corresponding to magnetizations of no more than 10$^{-3}$ $μ_B$/atom. These materials comprise a new class of {\it fragile magnetic superconductors} modeled as triplet pairing. The measured SC state properties, excepting only the fields detected below T$_c$, are representative of low T$_c$ singlet BCS SCs, not showing unusual coherence lengths or critical fields. While it is recognized that the muon does affect the sample by displacing nearby atoms and impacting magnetic interaction parameters, the measurement process, changing the system from sample $\rightarrow$ sample+$μ^+$ thereby breaking TRS, may deserve further scrutiny. This overview provides a survey of the environment of the muon, from the normal state to the superfluid state, where the induced supercurrent and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov gap states provide coupling of the muon moment to the superfluid. The unusual topological superconductor LaNiGa$_2$, currently modeled as non-unitary triplet, is used as a case study. Supposing that the prevailing $μ$SR inference of a small spontaneous field within the bulk of theSC obtains, the current picture of (possibly non-unitary) triplet pairing is discussed and an attractive alternative for LaNiGa$_2$ is noted.

Abstract: Superconductivity is one of the most amazing properties that metallic conductors exhibit. Electrical resistance is completely eliminated below the critical temperature (Tc), which is the most important parameter in superconductivity. Since the discovery of copper oxide superconductors 39 years ago, many solid state chemists have made significant contributions to the field by discovering new compounds and producing high-quality samples for physical measurements. However, superconductivity research remains challenging for most solid state chemists because it requires knowledge of complicated solid state physics. This manuscript aims to provide a simple, intuitive introduction to superconductivity using only fundamental physics concepts that solid state chemists are familiar with. The author investigates a wide range of materials and classifies them according to the superconductivity mechanisms that may drive them. Specifically focusing on a series of copper oxide superconductors with the highest Tc at ambient conditions, the remarkable material dependence of Tc and the underlying, unconventional superconductivity mechanism that leads to the high Tc are thoroughly examined. Although our understanding of cuprate superconductivity is still fragmented, the author believes that once the branches and leaves are removed, the story will be fairly simple, similar to the phonon-based superconductivity mechanism revealed by the BCS theory. Furthermore, potential strategies for raising the Tc of cuprates and other superconductors are discussed. The author hopes that this article will pique interest in superconductors in young solid state chemists and encourage them to pursue the discovery of still unknown and unexplored room-temperature superconductors in the future.

Abstract: We investigate thermal and non-local electrical transport in four-terminal Josephson junctions formed by a normal region coupled to two transverse chiral superconducting leads, supporting phases characterized by Chern numbers ${\cal C}=0,\,1$\,and\,2. We identify the conditions under which a single chiral Majorana mode (${\cal C}=1$) produces a robust half-quantized thermal conductance, while non-local electrical conductance remains strongly suppressed by particle-hole symmetry. Thermal conductance quantization occurs near a superconducting phase difference $π$, but only in the low-doping regime of the central region and in the intermediate- to long-junction limits. At finite Zeeman fields, the thermal response broadly follows the topology of the isolated superconducting leads for the $C=1$ phase while, in the ${\cal C}=2$ phase, the thermal conductance generally deviates from quantization, depending on the momentum-space location of the Majorana modes. Our results establish clear criteria for probing chiral Majorana modes in Josephson junctions and highlight the essential role of momentum-space structure, finite-size geometry, and sample parameters in thermal transport.

Abstract: Understanding vortex matter in type-II superconductors is central to controlling dissipation and flux pinning in superconducting materials and devices. Here, we use cryogenic scanning nitrogen vacancy magnetometry (NVM) to image Abrikosov vortices in the cuprate superconductors BSCCO-2212 and YBCO under controlled field-cooled conditions. Measurements, which are performed using continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cw-ODMR) in a closed-cycle cryostat, yield quantitative magnetic-field maps with nanoscale spatial resolution. In BSCCO-2212 at 71 K, we resolve a well-ordered triangular vortex lattice, whose symmetry and spacing are confirmed through 2D Fourier analysis and are consistent with flux quantization. YBCO thin films imaged at 3 K exhibit a more disordered vortex arrangement reflecting stronger pinning, while maintaining quantitative agreement between measured vortex density and the applied magnetic field. These results render our cryogenic scanning NVM a reliable quantitative tool for real-space studies of vortices in high-$T_c$ superconductors, in particular since such a remarkable magnetic resolution has been achieved within relatively short acquisition times of 2 to 4 h.
