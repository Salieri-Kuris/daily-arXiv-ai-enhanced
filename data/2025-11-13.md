### [1] [High-quality nanostructured diamond membranes for nanoscale quantum sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08632)
*Alexander Pakpour Tabrizi,Artur Lozovoi,Sean Karg,Tecla Bottinelli Mondandon,Melody Leung,Kai-Hung Cheng,Nathalie P. de Leon*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A low-damage diamond nanostructure fabrication method preserves NV center properties for quantum sensing and enables integration with diverse targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of subsurface damage and surface defects in diamond etching, which degrade the performance of NV center quantum sensors.

Method: The paper describes a novel procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes and a pick-and-place transfer method for integration.

Result: The fabrication scheme preserves optical and spin properties of NV centers near the surface and provides photonic enhancement.

Conclusion: The study successfully develops a low-damage fabrication procedure for diamond nanostructures, preserving NV center properties and enabling integration with diverse sensing targets.

Abstract: Deploying nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for condensed matter and materials physics requires placing the NV centers close to the sensing target. One solution is to fabricate diamond nanostructures and integrate them with materials and devices. However, diamond etching and ion milling can introduce subsurface damage and surface defects that degrade the charge stability and spin coherence of NV centers near the surface. Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets.

### [2] [Dephasing-induced Quantum Hall Criticality in the Quantum Anomalous Hall system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08635)
*Fei Yang,Dong E. Liu*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Pure dephasing alone can induce integer quantum Hall criticality, confirmed by simulations and theoretical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To show that pure dephasing, without elastic disorder, can generate θ-driven criticality similar to the integer quantum Hall effect.

Method: Derived an open system nonlinear σ model (NLσM) for class A with a topological θ term, and used boundary-driven simulations of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model with local dephasing.

Result: Predicted a quantum Hall critical point at σₓₓ=1/2 with finite σₓₓ, confirming nonperturbative instantons govern the flow of (σₓₓ, σₓₓ).

Conclusion: The paper reframes plateau physics in open solid-state and cold atom platforms, offering practical diagnostics for topological transport in nonunitary matter.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that static disorder is indispensable to the integer quantum Hall effect, underpinning both quantized plateaus and the plateau-plateau transition. We show that pure dephasing, without elastic disorder, is sufficient to generate the same $θ$ driven criticality. Starting from a Keldysh formulation, we derive an open system nonlinear $σ$ model (NL$σ$M) for class A with a topological $θ$ term but no Cooperon sector, and we demonstrate that nonperturbative instantons still govern a two parameter flow of $(σ_{xx},σ_{xy})$. Evaluating $θ$ in a dephasing quantum anomalous Hall setting, we predict a quantum Hall critical point at $σ_{xy}=1/2$ with finite $σ_{xx}$ the hallmark of the integer quantum Hall universality class realized without Anderson localization. Boundary driven simulations of the Qi_Wu_Zhang model with local dephasing confirm this prediction and provide an experimentally aligned protocol to extract $(σ_{xx},σ_{xy})$ from Hall potential maps. By establishing dephasing as a self contained route to Hall criticality, our framework reframes plateau physics in open solid state and cold atom platforms and offers practical diagnostics for topological transport in nonunitary matter.

*Simon Hettler,Raul Arenal*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: In-situ TEM study shows a nano-sized gap in a misfit layered compound affects electrical properties under vacuum, revealing voltage dependence on environment and heating history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how specific crystal orientations and phenomena related to electrical currents influence the (thermo)electric properties of misfit layered compounds using in-situ TEM.

Method: Used an in-situ TEM device to mechanically bend a misfit layered compound via differential heating currents, analyzing the relationship between (thermo)electric properties and crystal orientations.

Result: The nano-sized gap at a grain boundary enabled controllable mechanical bending and significantly affected the device's electrical properties, leading to a high intrinsic voltage influenced by the vacuum environment and heating history.

Conclusion: Interior surfaces, such as the nano-sized gap in the misfit layered compound, can significantly influence electrical properties even under high vacuum conditions, as demonstrated by the device's high intrinsic voltage and its dependence on vacuum environment and heating history.

Abstract: In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has become an important technique to study dynamic processes at highest spatial resolution and one branch is the investigation of phenomena related with electrical currents. Here, we present experimental results obtained from a peculiar in-situ TEM device, which was prepared with the aim to analyze the relationship between (thermo)electric properties and specific crystal orientations of a misfit layered compound. The formation of a nano-sized gap at a grain boundary facilitated a precisely controllable mechanical bending of the device by application of differential heating currents. The devices' electrical properties were found to be substantially influenced by the gap, leading to a high intrinsic voltage. This voltage additionally depends on the vacuum environment and on the history of applied heating currents. These findings are largely attributed to the presence of adsorbed molecules within the gap region. The electrical in-situ TEM studies of this work illustrate that interior surfaces can strongly influence electrical properties even under high vacuum conditions.

### [4] [Dynamical Orbital Angular Momentum Induced by Chiral Phonons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09271)
*Dapeng Yao,Dongwook Go,Yuriy Mokrousov,Shuichi Murakami*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Electrons' orbital angular momentum is induced by chiral phonons through Berry phase and orbital overlap modulation, with applications in orbitronics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of electrons is dynamically induced by chiral phonons, originating from the adiabatic evolution and Berry phase acquisition.

Method: By introducing a tight-binding model with p orbitals on a honeycomb lattice, we show a microscopic picture that chiral phonons modulate orbital overlaps of electrons, and calculate the generated OAM. We then construct an effective model for valley phonons with different phonon pseudoangular momenta (PAM) and identify their distinct intervalley-scattering channels.

Result: The induced OAM originates from the adiabatic evolution where electrons dynamically acquire Berry phase. The sign of the OAM depends on phonon chirality, and the model obeys the selection rule between phonons and electrons with the orbital degree of freedom.

Conclusion: Our results reveal a direct lattice-OAM transfer mechanism that emerges even in materials with weak spin-orbital coupling, opening a new promising way for orbitronics applications.

### [5] [Interface tuned Enhanced and Low Temperature Quenching of Orbital Hall Currents Induce Torque and magnetoresistance in Light Metal/Nickel Bilayers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09349)
*Dhananjaya Mahapatra,Harekrishna Bhunia,Manu S Pattelath,Partha Mitra*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Study shows orbital Hall effect in Ti/Ni bilayers, with Cu interlayer and Ti thickness enhancing OHT and UOMR, while temperature reduction decreases both.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate orbital current induced effects from the orbital Hall effect in light-metal/ferromagnet bilayers and understand the role of interfacial and bulk mechanisms.

Method: Second-harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltage measurements on Ti/Ni bilayers under applied a.c. current, with variations in Ti thickness and temperature.

Result: Insertion of a Cu interlayer enhances OHT efficiency and UOMR; both increase with Ti thickness and decrease with temperature, suggesting bulk orbital Hall effect dominance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the orbital Hall effect in light-metal/ferromagnet bilayers, particularly with a Cu interlayer, enhances orbital Hall torque efficiency and unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance, with temperature-dependent behaviors indicating a common underlying mechanism.

Abstract: We investigate orbital current induced effects arising from the orbital Hall effect in light-metal/ferromagnet bilayers. Thin films of Ti in ohmic contact with Ni were studied using second-harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltage measurements under an applied a.c. current. From these signals, we extract the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). Insertion of a Cu interlayer between the Ni/Ti interface leads to an enhancement of both OHT efficiency and UOMR compared to both Ni/Ti and Ni/Cu bilayers. Furthermore, systematic variation of Ti thickness reveals that both OHT efficiency and UOMR increase with increasing Ti thickness, indicating that the observed phenomena predominantly originate from the bulk orbital Hall effect rather than purely from interfacial mechanisms and Lowering the temperature leads to a clear reduction in both the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). The nearly linear and correlated temperature dependence of both parameters suggests a common underlying mechanism, namely, the orbital Hall effect in the light-metal layer, which governs both the generation of orbital current and its subsequent influence on the ferromagnet through orbital torque and orbital magnetoresistance.

### [6] [Spin and orbital-to-charge conversion in noncentrosymmetric materials: Hall versus Rashba-Edelstein effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09511)
*Diego Garcia Ovalle,Aurelien Manchon*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Study redefines spin/orbit-to-charge conversion in nonmagnetic materials, finding Rashba-Edelstein effect dominates in GeTe, with smaller Rashba parameter than expected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate spin- and orbital-to-charge conversion phenomena in nonmagnetic materials with broken inversion symmetry, addressing the contributions from the Hall effect and the Rashba-Edelstein effect.

Method: Development of a general formalism based on macroscopic observables, validated through a case study of ferroelectric GeTe and analysis using a drift-diffusion model.

Result: The effective Rashba parameter in ferroelectric GeTe is smaller than previously reported, and the charge current is primarily governed by the Rashba-Edelstein effect.

Conclusion: The study redefines spin- and orbit-to-charge interconversion coefficients using measurable observables, encouraging further research in quantum materials with broken inversion symmetry.

Abstract: We investigate spin- and orbital-to-charge conversion phenomena in nonmagnetic materials with broken inversion symmetry, treating the contributions from the Hall effect and the Rashba-Edelstein effect on an equal footing. We develop a general formalism for this interconversion based solely on macroscopic observables. The theory is validated through a case study of ferroelectric GeTe, where we find that the effective Rashba parameter obtained is smaller than previously reported values for the same material. Incorporating these parameters into a drift-diffusion model, we show that the generated charge current is primarily governed by the Rashba-Edelstein effect, rather than by the spin or orbital Hall effects. Our work redefines the spin- and orbit-to-charge interconversion coefficients in terms of directly measurable observables, encouraging the community to revisit these processes in other quantum materials lacking inversion symmetry.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore and solve the Schrödinger equation in non-trivial coordinate systems (Moon and Spencer's toroidal and electromagnetic toroidal--poloidal coordinates) where fractional angular momentum arises due to the torus's geometry.

Abstract: We present, for the first time, exact solutions for the Schrödinger equation in Moon and Spencer's toroidal coordinates, and in the electromagnetic toroidal--poloidal coordinate systems. Curiously, both systems present a fractional angular momentum, because of the torus's hole. We achieve these novel solutions using the irregular $\mathcal{R}$-separation of variables, an unexplored approach in Physics, which results in a wavefunction with fractional angular momentum eigenvalues. Numerous solutions for the Schrödinger equation in a variety of external potentials are shown, including an external magnetic field. A plane-wave expansion and a Green function are also presented, setting the stage for future progress in this area.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: DDQAOA dynamically adjusts circuit depth for QAOA, outperforming standard QAOA with fewer CNOT gates and better results on CSPP instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard QAOA's performance heavily depends on pre-selecting a circuit depth without clear guidance, limiting its practicality for NP-hard problems on NISQ hardware.

Method: DDQAOA adaptively expands circuit depth from p=1 to p=10 by transferring learned parameters based on convergence criteria, avoiding the need for pre-selecting a fixed depth.

Result: DDQAOA achieved superior performance on 100 instances of CSPP (10 and 16 qubit scales) with fewer CNOT gates, notably outperforming standard QAOA at p=15 (217% and 159.3% more CNOT gates for 10 and 16 qubit instances, respectively).

Conclusion: The DDQAOA variant outperforms standard QAOA by achieving better approximation ratios and success probabilities with fewer CNOT gate evaluations, demonstrating its practical applicability for combinatorial optimization on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) has emerged as a promising approach for solving NP hard combinatorial optimization problems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, its performance is critically dependent on the selection of the circuit depth a parameter that must be specified a priori without clear guidance. In this paper, we introduce a variant of QAOA called dynamic depth Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (DDQAOA) that resolves the challenge of pre selecting a fixed circuit depth. Our method adaptively expands circuit depth, starting from p = 1 and progressing up to p = 10, by transferring learned parameters to deeper circuits based on convergence criteria. We tested this approach on 100 instances of the Constrained Shortest Path Problem (CSPP) at 10 qubit and 16 qubit scales. Our DDQAOA achieved superior approximation ratios and success probabilities with fewer CNOT gate evaluations than the standard QAOA for p = 3, 5, 10, and 15. In particular, while standard QAOA at p = 15 achieved results close to our approach, it used 217% and 159.3% more CNOT gates for 10 qubit and 16 qubit instances, respectively. This demonstrates the performance and practical applicability of DDQAOA to solve combinatorial optimization problems on near term devices.

Abstract: We propose and demonstrate an experimental scheme to engineer thermal baths with independently tunable temperatures and dissipation rates for the motional modes of a trapped-ion system. This approach enables robust thermal-state preparation and quantum simulations of open-system dynamics in bosonic and spin-boson models at well-controlled finite temperatures. We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps. We then employ our scheme to study local-temperature effects in a two-mode vibrationally assisted exciton transfer system, where we observe thermally activated interference pathways for excitation transfer.

### [10] [Fractal structure of multipartite entanglement in monitored quantum circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08690)
*Vaibhav Sharma,Erich J Mueller*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Study shows entanglement depth in monitored quantum circuits scales as a power law with system size, with exponents varying by phase and linked to fractal dimensions of entangled clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of entanglement in quantum circuits with measurement-induced phase transitions, specifically the scaling of entanglement depth and its relation to the spatial distribution of entangled clusters.

Method: Analyzing the distribution of multipartite entanglement in states produced by a one-dimensional random monitored quantum circuit with local Clifford unitaries and single-site measurements, calculating entanglement depth and studying the spatial distribution of entangled clusters.

Result: Entanglement depth scales as a power law with system size in both volume law and area law phases, with the exponent varying continuously between 1 and 0. The largest entangled cluster exhibits fractal dimensions between 0 and 1, matching the power law exponent away from the critical point.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the largest cluster of entangled qubits exhibits fractal behavior, with the fractal dimension matching the power law exponent of entanglement depth, providing insights into the spatial distribution of entanglement in monitored quantum circuits.

Abstract: We analyze the distribution of multipartite entanglement in states produced in a one-dimensional random monitored quantum circuit where local Clifford unitaries are interspersed with single-site measurements performed with a probability $p$. This circuit has a measurement-induced phase transition at $p=p_c$, separating a phase in which the entanglement entropy scales with the system size (a volume law state) and one in which it scales with the boundary (an area law state). We calculate the entanglement depth, corresponding to the size of the largest cluster of entangled qubits, finding that it scales as a power law with system size in both the phases. The power law exponent is 1 in the volume law phase ($p < p_c$) and continuously decreases to 0 as $p \to 1$ in the area law phase. We explain this behavior by studying the spatial distribution of entangled clusters. We find that the largest cluster of entangled qubits in these states has a fractal dimension between 0 and 1 and appears to be self-similar. Away from the critical point, this fractal dimension matches the entanglement depth power law exponent.

*Katy Aruachan,Sanoj Raj,Yamil J. Colón,Daniel Aravena,Felipe Herrera*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study uses dynamical methods to model molecular spin qubits, revealing T1 and T2 scaling behaviors influenced by spin-lattice and magnetic noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fundamental limits of quantum coherence in solid-state molecular qubits with open-shell ground states is challenging due to complex qubit environments.

Method: A random Hamiltonian approach with fluctuating molecular g-tensors from molecular dynamics simulations is used to construct Redfield quantum master equations, predicting relaxation (T1) and dephasing (T2) times for copper porphyrin qubits.

Result: T1 scales as 1/B experimentally due to combined spin-lattice and magnetic noise contributions, while T2 scales strictly as 1/B^2 due to low-frequency dephasing from magnetic field noise.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the potential of dynamical methods for modeling the open quantum system dynamics of molecular spin qubits, highlighting the importance of both spin-lattice and magnetic noise contributions.

Abstract: Solid-state molecular qubits with open-shell ground states have great potential for addressability, scalability, and tunability, but understanding the fundamental limits of quantum coherence in these systems is challenging due to the complexity of the qubit environment. To address this, we develop a random Hamiltonian approach where the molecular $g$-tensor fluctuates due to classical lattice motion obtained from molecular dynamics simulations at constant temperature. Atomistic $g$-tensor fluctuations are used to construct Redfield quantum master equations that predict the relaxation $T_1$ and dephasing $T_2$ times of copper porphyrin qubits in a crystalline framework. Assuming one-phonon spin-lattice interaction processes, $1/T$ temperature scaling and $1/B^3$ magnetic field scaling of $T_1$ are established using atomistic bath correlation functions. Atomistic $T_1$ predictions overestimate the available experimental data by orders of magnitude. Quantitative agreement with measurements at all magnetic fields is restored by introducing a magnetic field noise model to describe lattice nuclear spins, with field-dependent noise amplitude in the range $δB\sim 10\,μ{\rm T}- 1\,{\rm mT}$ for the copper porphyrin system. We show that while $T_1$ scales as $1/B$ experimentally due to a combination of spin-lattice and magnetic noise contributions, $T_2$ scales strictly as $ 1/B^2$ due to low-frequency dephasing processes associated with magnetic field noise. Our work demonstrates the potential of dynamical methods for modeling the open quantum system dynamics of molecular spin qubits.

Result: 成功应用于研究自旋玻色模型中库的渐近加热，并展示了如何通过局部驱动稳定两个量子比特的瞬态纠缠。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了研究强阻尼量子系统稳态和瞬态动力学的透明理论和数值框架。

Abstract: We present an approach for efficiently simulating strongly damped quantum systems subjected to periodic driving, employing a periodic matrix product operator representation of the influence functional. This representation enables the construction of a numerically exact Floquet propagator that captures the non-Markovian open system dynamics, thus providing a dissipative analogue to the Floquet Hamiltonian of driven isolated quantum systems. We apply this method to study the asymptotic heating of a reservoir in spin-boson models, characterizing the deviation from equilibrium conditions. Moreover, we show how a local driving of two qubits can be utilized to stabilize a transient entanglement buildup of the qubits originating from the interaction with a common environment. Our results make it possible to directly study both stationary and transient dynamics of strongly damped and driven quantum systems within a transparent theoretical and numerical framework.

*João V. Cordeiro,Eduardo I. Duzzioni,Edgard P. M. Amorim*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum transport in lattice with complex-phase defects and time-dependent protocols enhances ballistic spreading and reveals Parrondo's paradox.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how complex-phase defects and time-dependent protocols can influence the quantum transport of delocalized states in continuous-time quantum walks, and to explore the enhancement of ballistic spreading in such systems.

Method: The research involves modeling a one-dimensional lattice with a single defect represented by complex-valued hopping amplitudes. A time-dependent alternation protocol between two distinct defect configurations is implemented to study their combined effect on quantum transport.

Result: A single defective site enhances ballistic spreading of an initially Gaussian wave packet. Combining two unfavorable defect configurations improves transport efficiency, revealing a manifestation of Parrondo's paradox in quantum walks.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the interplay between quantum interference and graph engineering, through complex-phase defects and time-dependent protocols, can significantly enhance quantum transport in continuous-time quantum walks with delocalized initial states.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum transport of delocalized states in continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on a one-dimensional lattice containing a single defect. The defect is modeled by assigning complex-valued hopping amplitudes to the edges that connect the site corresponding to the mean position of the initial delocalized state to its nearest neighbors. We find that this single defective site is sufficient to enhance the ballistic spreading of an initially Gaussian wave packet. Extending these results, we implement a time-dependent alternation protocol between two distinct defect configurations, each individually yielding poor propagation of the state. The combination of these two unfavorable configurations improves the transport efficiency of the quantum walker, revealing a manifestation of Parrondo's paradox in CTQWs with delocalized initial states. This study provides new insights into the role of complex-phase defects and time-dependent protocols in CTQWs, demonstrating that the interplay between quantum interference and graph engineering can effectively enhance quantum transport in discrete lattices.

TL;DR: A cold-atom method for vectorial magnetic sensing, resolving milli-Gauss fields via polarity-reversed absorption imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable vectorial magnetic sensing without spectroscopic interrogation, leveraging standard cold-atom setups.

Method: Using a cold-atom cloud in a magnetic quadrupole, with absorption imaging to determine cloud displacement under polarity reversal.

Result: Achieves milli-Gauss level resolution for transverse magnetic field components relative to the imaging axis.

Conclusion: The technique bridges traditional macroscopic magnetic field probes and atomic-physics-based precision sensors, offering a practical tool for field compensation.

Abstract: We present a technique for vectorial magnetic sensing using a cold-atom cloud trapped in a magnetic quadrupole. The center of the trapped cloud is determined by absorption imaging and compared for opposite polarities of the quadrupole. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the displacement of the cloud depends on both the field's direction and magnitude. By analyzing this shift under polarity reversal, we infer the two transverse components of a homogeneous external magnetic field relative to the imaging axis, without requiring spectroscopic interrogation. Assuming micron-scale position sensitivity and typical magnetic field gradients, the method enables resolution at the milli-Gauss level. It is compatible with standard cold-atom setups and offers a practical tool for field compensation in magnetically sensitive experimental stages. As such, it establishes a bridge between traditional macroscopic magnetic field probes and atomic-physics-based precision sensors.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines a stochastic trajectory framework for quantum dynamics, finding divergent solutions limit its use and strong quantum features are not recoverable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the applicability of a stochastic trajectory framework for sampling quantum dynamics in many-body quantum systems interacting with light.

Method: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) sampling the positive P phase-space representation with complex-valued dynamical variables.

Result: Numerical implementation shows divergent solutions, limiting the framework's use to finite propagation times. Divergences are mathematically essential, and regularization attempts only extend the valid time boundary slightly.

Conclusion: The framework's applicability is limited due to divergent solutions in phase-space methods, and it fails to capture strong quantum features like quantum collapse and revival.

Abstract: We critically explore the applicability of a recently proposed framework to sample the quantum dynamics of a many-body quantum system interacting with light by stochastic trajectories, applying it to the closed and open Tavis-Cummings model (TCM). The stochastic differential equations (SDEs) sample the positive P phase-space representation by analog complex-valued dynamical variables that are linked to the quantum operators. Statistical average over the stochastic trajectories yields the evolution of the quantum mechanical expectation values. However, numerical implementation of these SDEs for the TCM indicates divergent solutions, also known from other phase-space methods. This limits the applicability of the framework to finite propagation times, that are strongly dependent on the physical parameters and initial conditions of the system. We outline the underlying mathematical reason for these divergences and show that their contribution to the averages are, however, essential. To attempt to regularize the divergences, we transform the SDEs to an equivalent set of SDEs with different noise realisations, thereby pushing the valid time boundary. Quantum collapse and revival of the TCM, however, cannot be recovered by the stochastic trajectory approach, pointing to the general difficulty of the applicability of stochastic phase-space sampling methods to systems with strong quantum features.

TL;DR: A Ramsey interferometry protocol is proposed to directly probe anyonic statistics in fractional Chern insulators, using impurities for precise control and isolating geometric phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coherent control and braiding of anyons remain central challenges in realizing topologically protected quantum operations. The study aims to directly access the geometric phases associated with anyons in fractional Chern insulators.

Method: The approach employs Ramsey interferometry and spin-echo sequences to isolate the Aharonov-Bohm and exchange contributions to the geometric phase. It uses impurities with individually addressable internal states to bind and control anyons adiabatically.

Result: The protocol provides an unambiguous probe of anyonic statistics and is feasible in cold-atom quantum simulators and van der Waals heterostructures. Finite-size simulations highlight the role of edge effects.

Conclusion: The results establish impurity-based interferometry as a feasible route toward direct anyon braiding experiments in quantum simulators, laying the groundwork for future explorations of non-Abelian braiding and topological quantum control.

Abstract: Coherent control and braiding of anyons remain central challenges in realizing topologically protected quantum operations. We propose a Ramsey interferometry protocol to directly access the geometric phases associated with anyons in fractional Chern insulators. Our approach employs impurities with individually addressable internal states that bind to the anyons, allowing their adiabatic motion and exchange under full spatial control. By combining Ramsey and spin-echo sequences, the protocol isolates the Aharonov-Bohm and exchange contributions to the total geometric phase, providing an unambiguous probe of anyonic statistics. Our scheme can potentially be implemented in cold-atom quantum simulators as well as in van der Waals heterostructures. Complementary finite-size simulations in non-interacting Chern insulators quantify the system sizes required to faithfully extract geometric phases, highlighting the role of edge effects. Our results establish impurity-based interferometry as a feasible route toward direct anyon braiding experiments in quantum simulators and lay the groundwork for future explorations of non-Abelian braiding and topological quantum control.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: New compilation techniques for early fault-tolerant quantum computing reduce qubit requirements by up to 60% while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing need for compilation strategies suited for early FTQC systems, which face stringent resource constraints (fewer physical qubits and limited distillation capacity), in contrast to present-day techniques that assume abundant resources.

Method: The paper introduces compilation techniques tailored for early FTQC systems, including distillation-adaptive qubit layouts and routing techniques, and employs simple greedy heuristics to optimize resource efficiency.

Result: The techniques achieve a 53% reduction in qubits compared to theoretical lower bounds, with only a 1.2X overhead in execution time, demonstrating their effectiveness.

Conclusion: The developed compilation techniques offer significant reductions in qubit requirements (up to 60%) with minimal execution time overhead (1.2X), making them highly practical for early FTQC systems with limited resources.

Abstract: Fault-tolerance is the future of quantum computing, ensuring error-corrected quantum computation that can be used for practical applications. Resource requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) are daunting, and hence, compilation techniques must be designed to ensure resource efficiency. There is a growing need for compilation strategies tailored to the early FTQC regime, which refers to the first generation of fault-tolerant machines operating under stringent resource constraints of fewer physical qubits and limited distillation capacity. Present-day compilation techniques are largely focused on overprovisioning of routing paths and make liberal assumptions regarding the availability of distillation factories. Our work develops compilation techniques that are tailored to the needs of early FTQC systems, including distillation-adaptive qubit layouts and routing techniques. In particular, we show that simple greedy heuristics are extremely effective for this problem, offering up to 60% reduction in the number of qubits compared to prior works. Our techniques offer results with an average overhead of 1.2X in execution time for a 53% reduction in qubits against the theoretical lower bounds. As the industry develops early FTQC systems with tens to hundreds of logical qubits over the coming years, our work has the potential to be widely useful for optimising program executions.

Abstract: Extending the quantum formulation of [Phys. Rev. X 3, 041003 (2013)] to a more general setting for studying the thermodynamics of information processing including initial correlations, we generalize the second law of thermodynamics to account for information processing in such autonomous systems. We consider a composite quantum system consisting of a principal system, heat bath, memory, and work source, and adopt an autonomous Hamiltonian framework. We derive constraints on the total Hamiltonian that ensure the work source to act as a catalyst preserving its original randomness, namely that the total unitary evolution must have a unitary partial transpose. We show that this requirement is equivalent to the commutativity of operators acting on the joint system of the principal system, bath, and memory, which underlies the Hamiltonian structure. Next, we generalize the quantum speed limit for the joint dynamics of system and memory to the quantum thermodynamic speed limit, from which we obtain a dynamical version of Landauer's bound. More importantly, we also interpret this quantum thermodynamic speed limit in the context of quantum hypothesis testing.

Abstract: Massive quantum systems have emerged as compelling tabletop interface-systems for testing the quantum nature of gravity. However, conventional schemes that focus on directly using gravity to induce entanglement suffer from overwhelming environmental decoherence: maintaining entanglement between two oscillators requires an impractically high mechanical quality factor. In this work, we put forward an alternative reservoir-engineered scheme, whose core function is to quantify how gravity modifies (rather than prepares) the steady-state entanglement. Compared to quantum gravity, classical gravity introduces additional dissipative channels, which in turn give rise to distinct entanglement characteristics and thus enable the discrimination between the two types of gravity. Notably, this entanglement difference can still be maintained even when the mechanical quality factor is far below the threshold required by conventional schemes. Moreover, it demonstrates significant robustness against non-gravitational couplings, specifically, those like Casimir and Coulomb forces that are inherent in experimental setups. Our scheme relaxes the experimental requirements for verifying quantum gravity, thereby paving a new path toward its near-term realization.

TL;DR: Electrical spin readout for hBN boron vacancies enables compact quantum devices, advancing quantum sensing and information applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optical methods for reading spin states of boron vacancies in hBN are limiting for compact and miniaturized quantum devices, which could otherwise be highly promising for quantum sensing and information tasks.

Method: A photoelectric spin readout technique is developed for boron vacancies in hBN, leveraging spin-dependent ionization dynamics and non-radiative transitions to a metastable state.

Result: Successful electrical detection of spin states, including dynamical decoupling sequences (e.g., CPMG) and nuclear spins via electron-nuclear double resonance, was achieved.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a pathway for on-chip integration and real-field applications of quantum functionalities using 2D materials, potentially advancing quantum sensing and information technologies.

Abstract: Negatively charged boron vacancy ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is the most extensively studied room-temperature quantum spin system in two-dimensional (2D) materials. Nevertheless, the current effective readout of $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ spin states is carried out by systematically optical methods. This limits their exploitation in compact and miniaturized quantum devices, which would otherwise hold substantial promise to address quantum sensing and quantum information tasks. In this study, we demonstrated a photoelectric spin readout technique for $\mathrm{V_B^-}$ spins in hBN. The observed photocurrent signals stem from the spin-dependent ionization dynamics of boron vacancies, mediated by spin-dependent non-radiative transitions to a metastable state. We further extend this electrical detection technique to enable the readout of dynamical decoupling sequences, including the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) protocols, and of nuclear spins via electron-nuclear double resonance. These results provide a pathway toward on-chip integration and real-field exploitation of quantum functionalities based on 2D material platforms.

Conclusion: ALD is established as a viable low-temperature deposition technique for superconducting quantum circuits, and all-nitride ALD qubits are positioned as a promising platform for operation at elevated temperatures.

Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum processors benefits from superconducting qubits that can operate at elevated temperatures and be fabricated with scalable, foundry-compatible processes. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is increasingly being adopted as an industrial standard for thin-film growth, particularly in applications requiring precise control over layer thickness and composition. Here, we report superconducting qubits based on NbN/AlN/NbN trilayers deposited entirely by ALD. By varying the number of ALD cycles used to form the AlN barrier, we achieve Josephson tunneling through barriers of different thicknesses, with critical current density spanning seven orders of magnitude, demonstrating the uniformity and versatility of the process. Owing to the high critical temperature of NbN, transmon qubits based on these all-nitride trilayers exhibit microsecond-scale relaxation times, even at temperatures above 300 mK. These results establish ALD as a viable low-temperature deposition technique for superconducting quantum circuits and position all-nitride ALD qubits as a promising platform for operation at elevated temperatures.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates a quantum teleportation scheme that outperforms direct photon transmission by a factor of 2.95, overcoming photon loss challenges in quantum communications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photon loss is a significant barrier in quantum communications, making advanced applications like loophole-free Bell tests and device-independent quantum key distribution challenging. Quantum teleportation, relying on quantum entanglement, could overcome this loss but has not outperformed direct transmission experimentally.

Method: An all-optical scheme for remote preparation of entangled photons is proposed and demonstrated, achieving an 82% heralding efficiency for event-ready entangled photons through a 15-dB channel loss.

Result: The teleportation-based transmission shows a 2.95-fold enhancement in efficiency over direct transmission, overcoming the limitations of photon loss.

Conclusion: The study establishes an unconditional teleportational advantage by demonstrating a 2.95-fold enhancement in transmission efficiency compared to direct photon transmission.

Abstract: Photon loss is the biggest enemy in quantum communications. Direct transmission typically results in a small fraction of photons surviving over long distances, hindering advanced applications such as loophole-free Bell tests and device-independent quantum key distribution. Quantum teleportation offers a "disembodied" way of transferring particles through a virtual channel--quantum entanglement--which, in principle, could overcome the photon transmission loss. Experimentally, however, no previous quantum teleportation of single photons has shown a higher survival probability than using direct transmission. To overcome this challenge, here we first propose and demonstrate an all-optical scheme for remote preparation of entangled photons. Through an effective 15-dB channel loss, we realize a heralding efficiency of 82% for event-ready entangled photons. Based on the prior distributed entanglement, we demonstrate that teleportation-based transmission efficiency offers a 2.95-fold enhancement, compared to using direct transmission through the same channel, therefore establishing an unconditional teleportational advantage.

Motivation: To understand the phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems with PT symmetry and their implications for wave scattering and device design.

Method: Investigation of a two-parametric family of one-dimensional non-Hermitian complex potentials with PT symmetry, exploration of phase transitions, and construction of exact bound state solutions under specific parameter conditions.

Result: Two distinct types of phase transitions identified: one related to spectral singularities (SSs) and the other to the collision of pairs at the bottom of the continuous spectrum. A universal relationship governing the number of SSs was established.

Conclusion: The study provides a fundamental theoretical framework for manipulating wave scattering in non-Hermitian systems, with implications for designing advanced optical and quantum devices.

Abstract: We investigate a two-parametric family of one-dimensional non-Hermitian complex potentials with parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. We find that there exist two distinct types of phase transitions, from an unbroken phase (characterized by a real spectrum) to a broken phase (where the spectrum becomes complex). The first type involves the emergence of a pair of complex eigenvalues bifurcating from the continuous spectrum. The second type is associated with the collision of such pairs at the bottom of the continuous spectrum. The first transition type is closely related to spectral singularities (SSs), at which point the transmission and reflection coefficients are divergent simultaneously. The second is associated with the emergence of bound states. In particular, under specific parameter conditions, we construct an exact bound state solution. By systematically exploring the parameter space, we establish a universal relationship governing the number of SSs in these potentials. These findings provide a fundamental theoretical framework for manipulating wave scattering in non-Hermitian systems, offering promising implications for designing advanced optical and quantum devices.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore how relativistic motion affects the performance of quantum thermal machines, particularly in regimes where classical thermodynamic limits may be violated.

Method: The authors investigate a two-qubit SWAP thermal machine using Unruh-DeWitt qubit detectors as the working medium. They analyze the system in the presence of relative motion between the detectors and thermal baths at different temperatures, deriving thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) to study the trade-offs.

Result: The results show that relativistic motion can lead to stronger violations of classical TURs and enhance the performance of the thermal machine (as a heat engine or refrigerator) beyond standard Carnot limits.

Conclusion: The study concludes that relativistic motion can enhance the performance of quantum thermal machines beyond classical Carnot limits, while also leading to stronger violations of classical thermodynamic uncertainty relations.

Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit SWAP thermal machine -- a streamlined analogue of the four-stroke Otto cycle -- whose working medium comprises inertially moving Unruh-DeWitt qubit detectors, each coupled to a thermal quantum field bath prepared at a different temperature. In the presence of relative motion between the working medium and the thermal baths, we derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) that quantify the trade-off between performance, entropy production, and power fluctuations. Our analysis identifies regimes where relativistic motion leads to stronger violation of classical TURs, previously observed in static quantum setups. In addition, we establish generalized performance bounds for the thermal machine operating as either a heat engine or a refrigerator, and discuss how relativistic motion can enhance their performances beyond the standard Carnot limits defined by rest-frame temperatures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance operational stealth in quantum LiDAR by making beam steering inherently unpredictable, overcoming the predictability of raster-scanned telescope pointing in prior demonstrations.

Method: A novel stealth beam steering method using quantum LiDAR, where probe photons diffract unpredictably at a grating due to wavelength randomness, while heralding photons' arrival times determine the diffraction direction.

Result: The method successfully detects multiple targets in parallel, achieving up to a 1000-fold enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio compared to classical LiDAR.

Conclusion: The breakthrough establishes a new paradigm for quantum-enhanced sensing, impacting quantum metrology, secure communications, and other fields.

Abstract: Quantum LiDAR offers noise resilience and stealth observation capabilities in low-light conditions. In prior demonstrations, the telescope pointing was raster-scanned, making the observation direction predictable from the pointing direction. However, while Quantum LiDAR can enable stealth observation, operational stealth is enhanced by inherently unpredictable beam steering. Here, we introduce a novel stealth beam steering method that is fundamentally immune to prediction. In a photon pair, the probe photon undergoes diffraction in an unpredictable direction at a grating due to wavelength randomness. The arrival time of the heralding photon, delayed by propagation through a dispersive medium, enables the determination of the probe photon's diffraction direction. Our method successfully detects multiple targets in parallel, demonstrating up to a 1000-fold enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio compared to classical LiDAR. This breakthrough establishes a new paradigm for quantum-enhanced sensing, with far-reaching implications for quantum metrology, secure communications, and beyond.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the relationship between coherent measurements and SDI steering, and to develop a resource theory for SDI steering that connects to standard steering and measurement incompatibility.

Method: The research leverages coherent measurements to demonstrate SDI steering and local randomness generation, formulating a one-to-one mapping between SDI steerable correlations and measurement coherence.

Result: Coherent measurements are identified as necessary and sufficient for SDI steering, and a nonconvex monotone is derived for quantifying local randomness in two-qubit states.

Conclusion: The study establishes a nonconvex resource theory for SDI steering and derives a nonconvex monotone for quantifying local randomness from two-qubit states without entanglement certification.

Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that a set of coherent measurements leverages semi-device-independent (SDI) steering and local randomness generation. To this end, we show that coherent measurements are a necessary resource for demonstrating SDI steering. Conversely, through one-to-one mapping of an SDI steerable correlation to a set of measurements, the coherence of the measurements, in turn, is a necessary and sufficient criterion for SDI steering. This result aligns with the relationship between the standard steering scenario and the measurement incompatibility. Then a nonconvex resource theory for SDI steering is formulated and a nonconvex monotone of the resource is obtained in the two-setting scenario using the above-mentioned one-to-one mapping. Finally, we apply this monotone to the quantification of local randomness from two-qubit states without requiring entanglement to be certified.

Conclusion: 采用连续变量态和典型损耗攻击假设的PRQS协议在实践中能更精确地量化估计误差和隐私保护水平。

Abstract: Private remote quantum sensing (PRQS) aims at estimating a parameter at a distant location by transmitting quantum states on an insecure quantum channel, limiting information leakage and disruption of the estimation itself from an adversary. Previous results highlighted that one can bound the estimation performance in terms of the observed noise. However, if no assumptions are placed on the channel model, such bounds are very loose and severely limit the estimation. We propose and analyse a PRQS using, for the first time to our knowledge, continuous-variable states in the single-user setting. Assuming a typical class of lossy attacks and employing tools from quantum communication, we calculate the true estimation error and privacy of our protocol, both in the asymptotic limit of many channel uses and in the finite-size regime. Our results show that a realistic channel-model assumption, which can be validated with measurement data, allows for a much tighter quantification of the estimation error and privacy for all practical purposes.

Abstract: One-dimensional quantum systems that undergo spontaneous symmetry-breaking, having a symmetric (non-degenerate) and a broken-symmetry (doubly-degenerate) phase, have been intensely studied in different branches of physics. In most cases, the spontaneously-broken symmetry is parity. However, it is possible to obtain similar phases in systems without parity symmetry, through an antiunitary symmetry that implies a two-fold symmetry either on momentum or coordinate in the system's classical limit. To illustrate this phenomenon, we use a Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) with one- and two-photon drives that, despite the breaking of parity symmetry, may have doubly-degenerate levels. Different realizations of squeezed KPOs convey a great deal of attention, as effective Hamiltonians for driven superconducting circuits and the occurrence of degeneracy in such systems could be of practical interest in their application to obtain protected qubits in parity-breaking setups. In addition to this, the reported spectral features strongly indicate the existence of additional symmetries in the system.

However, achieving this potential requires overcoming several fundamental challenges. One key limitation arises at the prediction stage, where the intrinsic randomness of quantum model outputs necessitates repeated executions, resulting in substantial overhead. To overcome this, we propose a novel measurement strategy for a variational quantum classifier that allows us to define the unambiguous quantum classifier. This strategy achieves near-deterministic predictions while maintaining competitive classification accuracy in noisy environments, all with significantly fewer quantum circuit executions. Although this approach entails a slight reduction in performance, it represents a favorable trade-off for improved resource efficiency. We further validate our theoretical model with supporting experimental results.

Abstract: Motivated by the perspective of advanced time-series prediction and exploitation of Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC), we explored the design and implementation of a Hybrid Photonic-Quantum Reservoir Computing (HPQRC) paradigm. It brings together the high-speed parallelism of photonic systems with the quantum reservoir's capacity of modeling complex, nonlinear dynamics, and hence acts as a powerful tool for performing real-time prediction in resource resource-constrained environment with low latency.

Result: Demonstrated accurate short-term trajectory reconstruction, faithful attractor geometry capture, and robust forecasting beyond several Lyapunov times.

Conclusion: The study establishes tensor networks as a universal paradigm for complex dynamical system modeling, offering interpretability and potential applications in climate systems and hybrid quantum-classical simulations.

Abstract: We present a tensor network model (TNM) for forecasting nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, bridging quantum many-body methods with classical complex systems. The TNM leverages hierarchical tensor contractions to encode non-Markovian temporal correlations and multiscale structures, enabling compact and interpretable representations of chaotic flows. Using the Lorenz and Rössler systems as benchmarks, we show that the TNM accurately reconstructs short-term trajectories and faithfully captures the attractor geometry. The model enables robust short-term forecasting beyond several Lyapunov times, offering a meaningful horizon for data-driven prediction under chaos. Inhomogeneous parametrization of weight tensors improves convergence and robustness compared to homogeneous parametrization, while scaling with bond dimension reveals saturation beyond modest values, consistent with the low intrinsic dimensionality of the chaotic attractor. This work establishes tensor networks as a universal paradigm for data-driven modeling of complex dynamical systems, offering physically motivated control of model expressivity and opening pathways toward applications in climate systems and hybrid quantum-classical simulations.

Result: The proposed method achieves a 50% reduction in qubit resources compared to prior protocols, validated through numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a hybrid-code system with triorthogonal code and its paired code supports a fully transversal Toffoli gate, enabling a more efficient Toffoli state distillation protocol.

Abstract: We study the transversality of the Toffoli gate in a hybrid-code system that employs two quantum error correction codes with special structure. We find that a system using a triorthogonal code with its paired code supports a fully transversal implementation of the Toffoli gate. Through circuit-level analysis, we prove the transversality of the Toffoli operation in this system. Based on this hybrid-code framework, we propose a Toffoli state distillation protocol that does not rely on pre-distilled $\mathbf{T}$-gate magic states. In our approach, the Toffoli state is directly distilled layer by layer within the hybrid-code system using only transversal operations. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method uses approximately 50\% fewer qubit resources than previously reported protocols.

Abstract: The generation of quantum entanglement is important for a wide range of quantum technology protocols. In nanophotonics, a promising platform for quantum technologies, entanglement generation via plasmon-mediated coupling in quantum dot qubits is often modeled within the dipole limit, where only dipolar plasmons of the mediating nanoparticle are considered, and the local response approximation, where nonlocal corrections are ignored. However, multipolar effects manifest strongly at coupling distances less than the nanoparticle size, while nonlocal optical effects stem from a size-induced dielectric response. We investigated these two important effects in the generation of two-qubit entanglement mediated by plasmonic coupling. A cavity quantum electrodynamic approach is employed, where the induced plasmonic effects lead to modified transition rates in the dynamics of the coupled quantum dot qubits. We find that multipolar modes and size-dependent damping lead to entanglement decay at small coupling distances and limit mediated entanglement with certain particle sizes. We discuss potential implications of multipolar modes in entanglement-based quantum sensing.

Abstract: This study systematically benchmarks classical optimization strategies for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm when applied to Generalized Mean-Variance Problems under near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum conditions. We evaluate Dual Annealing, Constrained Optimization by Linear Approximation, and the Powell Method across noiseless, sampling noise, and two thermal noise models. Our Cost Function Landscape Analysis revealed that the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm angle parameters $γ$ were largely inactive in the noiseless regime. This insight motivated a parameter-filtered optimization approach, in which we focused the search space exclusively on the active $β$ parameters. This filtering substantially improved parameter efficiency for fast optimizers like Constrained Optimization by Linear Approximation (reducing evaluations from 21 to 12 in the noiseless case) and enhanced robustness, demonstrating that leveraging structural insights is an effective architecture-aware noise mitigation strategy for Variational Quantum Algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional Fermion-to-qubit mappings, which produce high-weight Pauli terms and are inefficient for realistic chemical systems with dense two-body interactions.

Method: The method includes path optimization within the Hamiltonian's interaction graph to minimize operator weight, multi-edge graph structures for error detection, and a stabilizer measurement framework using Clifford simulation.

Result: GSE outperforms prior encodings in accuracy and hardware efficiency, with notable improvements in absolute and correlation energy estimates for simulations of $(H_2)_2$ and $(H_2)_3$ systems under realistic noise.

Conclusion: The work establishes the Generalized Superfast Encoding (GSE) as a highly attractive mapping for molecular quantum simulations, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and hardware efficiency.

Abstract: Simulating molecular systems on quantum computers requires efficient mappings from Fermionic operators to qubit operators. Traditional mappings such as Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev often produce high-weight Pauli terms, increasing circuit depth and measurement complexity. Although several local qubit mappings have been proposed to address this challenge, most are specialized for structured models like the Hubbard Hamiltonian and perform poorly for realistic chemical systems with dense two-body interactions. In this work, we utilize a suite of techniques to construct compact and noise-resilient Fermion-to-qubit mappings suitable for general molecular Hamiltonians. Building on the Generalized Superfast Encoding (GSE) and other similar works, we demonstrate that it outperforms prior encodings in both accuracy and hardware efficiency for molecular simulations. Our improvements include path optimization within the Hamiltonian's interaction graph to minimize operator weight, introduction of multi-edge graph structures for enhanced error detection without added circuit depth, and a stabilizer measurement framework that directly maps logical terms and stabilizers to the Z-basis using Clifford simulation. Applying these methods to simulations of $(H_2)_2$ and $(H_2)_3$ systems yields significantly improved absolute and correlation energy estimates under realistic hardware noise, with further accuracy gains achieved by increasing code distance. We also propose a [[2N, N, 2]] variant of GSE compatible with square-lattice and (quasi-)linear hardware topologies, demonstrating a twofold reduction in RMSE for orbital rotations on IBM Kingston hardware. These results establish GSE as a very attractive mapping for molecular quantum simulations.

Motivation: To investigate the generation of correlated photon pairs using finite energy Airy beams and explore their spatial and momentum correlations in near-field and far-field configurations.

Method: The research utilizes spontaneous parametric down-conversion of an optical pump in the form of a finite energy Airy beam. The optical system function is computed to study the propagation of down-converted beams. The spectral function is used to calculate the biphoton amplitude for coincidence counts in both far-field and near-field configurations. Spatial Schmidt modes are examined to analyze correlations.

Result: The study successfully reconstructs the finite energy Airy beam in the spatial correlation of down-converted beams in near-field scenarios. In far field, the coincidence counts reflect the biphoton momentum's anti-correlation. Longer crystals exhibit tighter real-space correlations but higher-dimensional angular correlations, while shorter crystals show fewer momentum-space modes and broader multimode correlations in position space.

It also highlights the impact of crystal length on real-space and momentum-space correlations.

Abstract: We describe the generation of correlated photon pairs by means of spontaneous parametric down-conversion of an optical pump in the form of a finite energy Airy beam. The optical system function, which contributes to the propagation of the down-converted beam before being registered by the detectors, is computed. The spectral function is utilized to calculate the biphoton amplitude for finding the coincidence count of the inbound Airy photons in both far-field and near-field configurations. We report the reconstruction of the finite energy Airy beam in the spatial correlation of the down-converted beams in near field scenario. In far field, the coincidence counts resembles the probability density of the biphoton in momentum space, revealing a direct mapping of the anti-correlation of the biphoton momentum. By examining the spatial Schmidt modes, we also demonstrate that longer crystals have tighter real-space correlations, but higher-dimensional angular correlations, whereas shorter crystals have fewer modes in momentum space and broader multimode correlations in position space.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of identifying an efficiently computable and accurate multipartite entanglement measure due to the complexity of quantum many-body systems.

Method: A family of two-parameter multipartite entanglement measures for mixed states, termed unified-entropy concentratable entanglements, was introduced. The measures were validated through theoretical proofs and practical demonstrations on near-term quantum devices.

Result: The unified-entropy concentratable entanglements were shown to be well-defined entanglement monotones with properties like subadditivity and continuity. They effectively distinguish between GHZ and W states and exhibit greater sensitivity in detecting certain quantum network states.

Conclusion: The proposed unified-entropy concentratable entanglements offer a versatile and effective framework for quantifying multipartite entanglement in quantum systems, with practical applications in distinguishing between entangled states like GHZ and W states.

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is regarded as a crucial physical resource in quantum network communication. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of quantum many-body systems, identifying a multipartite entanglement measure that is both efficiently computable and capable of accurately characterizing entanglement remains a challenging problem. To address these issues, we propose a family of two-parameter multipartite entanglement measures for mixed states, termed unified-entropy concentratable entanglements. Many well-known multipartite entanglement measures are recovered as special cases of this family of measures, such as the entanglement of formation and the concentratable entanglements introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 140501 (2021)]. We demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements constitutes a well-defined entanglement monotones, and establish several desirable properties it satisfies, such as subadditivity and continuity. We further investigate the ordering relations of unified-entropy concentratable entanglements and discuss how these quantities can be efficiently estimated on near-term quantum devices. As an application, we demonstrate that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements can effectively distinguish between multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and W states. The ordering relations of these entanglement measures are further validated using four-partite star quantum network states and four-qubit Dicke states. Moreover, we find that the unified-entropy concentratable entanglements exhibit greater sensitivity than the original concentratable entanglements in detecting certain four-partite star quantum network states.

Motivation: Quantum noise typically hinders quantum computation, but its potential beneficial effects on quantum neural networks' generalization performance are explored.

Method: A pre-training procedure is proposed to determine the optimal quantum noise level, analyzed using the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix.

Result: Optimal noise induces parameter equalization, improving generalization, as evidenced by numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that an optimal level of quantum noise can positively influence the generalization performance of quantum machine learning algorithms by equalizing variational parameters.

Abstract: Quantum noise is known to strongly affect quantum computation, thus potentially limiting the performance of currently available quantum processing units. Even models of quantum neural networks based on variational quantum algorithms, which were designed to cope with the limitations of state-of-the art noisy hardware capabilities, are affected by noise-induced barren plateaus, arising when the noise level becomes too strong. However, the generalization performances of such quantum machine learning algorithms can also be positively influenced by a proper level of noise, despite its generally detrimental effects. Here, we propose a pre-training procedure to determine the quantum noise level leading to desirable optimization landscape properties. We show that an optimal quantum noise level induces an ``equalization'' of variational parameters: the least important parameters gain relevance in the computation, while the most relevant ones lose it. We analyse this noise-induced equalization through the lens of the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix, thus providing a recipe that allows to estimate the noise level inducing the strongest equalization. Then, we report on extensive numerical simulations providing evidence of the beneficial noise effects in the neighborhood of the best equalization, often leading to improved generalization.

Abstract: Entanglement classification of pure multipartite quantum states is a challenging problem in quantum information theory that can be mathematically stated as orbit classification for some given group action on the ambient Hilbert space. The group action depends on the grained classification one expects, the finer-grained one being the classification up to local unitary transformation (LU). In this article, we show how a variational quantum circuit approach can be used to learn entanglement orbits, and we apply our findings to build a classifier for four-qubit states.

Abstract: As established in the seminal work by Berry et al.[1], expanding the time evolution operator using truncated Taylor series (up to some order $K$) makes a good candidate for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics. Here, we adapt the method but present an alternative quantum circuit that maintains an equivalent asymptotic elementary gate cost but has an exponentially reduced number of ancilla qubits. This is realized by utilizing mid-circuit measurements (with early abort-and-restart of circuit execution), and transforming a series of multi-controlled$(H^k)$ to a series of singly-controlled$(H^{k'})$, where $H$ is a linear combination of unitaries and $k, k'$ are integers. The proposed circuit utilizes a total of $\lceil \log(K) \rceil + \lceil \log(L) \rceil +n$ qubits, where $L$ is the number of terms in the Hamiltonian and $n$ is the system qubit size. Our shorter width circuit with mid-measurements protocol is implemented and evaluated using the programming language Guppy[2,3].

Abstract: Implementing quantum gates on quantum computers can require the application of carefully shaped pulses for high-fidelity operations. We explore the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for quantum optimal control to assess their usefulness in predicting such pulses. Our PINN is a feedforward neural network that utilizes an unsupervised learning approach, whose loss function includes terms that enforce the equations that govern the evolution of a quantum system, measure how close the learned unitary is to the target unitary operation, and ensure state normalization. We use a sinusoidal activation function and adopt variance-type weight initialization, tailored to our activation function. By analyzing the model's performance with important machine learning metrics, we demonstrate that the choice of our architecture is well-suited for this type of problem. We ensure that our network avoids the vanishing and exploding gradients with our relevant choices.

Motivation: Addressing the limitations of conventional noise characterization methods that assume stationarity, leading to suboptimal decoding performance under time-dependent noise.

Method: A rigorous analytical framework using syndrome statistics, sliding-window estimation with optimal window sizes, an iterative algorithm for multiple drift frequencies, and an overlapping window algorithm for rapid noise drifts.

Result: Validation through simulations shows robust tracking of multi-frequency noise drifts, alignment of estimated logical error rates with ground-truth, and error suppression over static models.

Conclusion: The framework proposed in this paper effectively captures and adapts to time-dependent Pauli noise, improving decoding performance and logical error rate suppression compared to static models.

Abstract: Advancing quantum information processors and building fault-tolerant architectures rely on the ability to accurately characterize the noise sources and suppress their impact on quantum devices. In practice, noise often drifts over time, whereas conventional noise characterization and decoding methods typically assume stationarity or provide only a time-average behavior of the noise. This treatment can result in suboptimal decoding performance. In this work, we present a rigorous analytical framework to capture time-dependent Pauli noise, by exploiting the syndrome statistics of quantum error correction experiments. We propose a sliding-window estimation method which allows us to recover the frequency components of the noise, by using optimal window sizes that we derive analytically. We prove the noise-filtering behavior of sliding windows, linking window size to spectral cutoff frequencies, and provide an iterative algorithm that captures multiple drift frequencies. We further introduce an overlapping window algorithm that enables us to capture rapid multi-frequency noise drifts in a single-pass fashion. Simulations for both phenomenological and circuit-level noise models validate our framework, demonstrating robust tracking of multi-frequency drift. The logical error rate obtained from our estimated models consistently align with the ground-truth logical error rate, and we find suppression of logical errors compared to static error models. Our window-based estimation methods and adaptive decoding offer new insights into noise spectroscopy and decoder optimization under drift using only syndrome data.

*Octave Mestoudjian,Matt Wilson,Augustin Vanrietvelde,Pablo Arrighi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper generalizes locality and causality in quantum subsystems using splitting maps and proves equivalence between semi-causality and semi-localisability for all subsystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the process-theoretic view of locality and causality in subsystems beyond the tensor product case to general quantum systems, including non-factor finite-dimensional Von Neumann algebras.

Method: The paper introduces splitting maps in dagger symmetric monoidal categories to generalize locality and causality in subsystems, utilizing a comprehension preorder and categorical trace adaptation.

Result: The comprehension preorder captures the inclusion partial order between Von Neumann algebras, and the splitting map trace aligns with the natural Von Neumann algebra trace. The equivalence between semi-causality and semi-localisability is proven for all subsystems.

Conclusion: The paper extends the equivalence between semi-causality and semi-localisability from factor subsystems to all subsystems, including non-factor ones, using the developed diagrammatic tools.

Abstract: We extend the usual process-theoretic view on locality and causality in subsystems (based on the tensor product case) to general quantum systems (i.e. possibly non-factor, finite-dimensional Von Neumann algebras). To do so, we introduce a primitive notion of splitting maps within dagger symmetric monoidal categories. Splitting maps give rise to subsystems that admit comparison via a preorder called comprehension, and support an adaptation of the usual categorical trace. We show that the comprehension preorder precisely captures the inclusion partial order between Von Neumann algebras, and that the splitting map trace captures the natural notion of Von Neumann algebra trace. As a consequence of the development of these diagrammatic tools, we prove that the known equivalence between semi-causality and semi-localisability for factor subsystems extends to all (including non-factor) subsystems.

TL;DR: The paper defines and studies vital rank-one POVMs for pure-state information completeness, proving upper bounds on their size in different dimensions and providing constructions to achieve these bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand and characterize the minimal sets of measurements (POVMs) that are sufficient for reconstructing pure quantum states, which is a fundamental problem in quantum state tomography.

Method: The study focuses on rank-one POVMs and their properties, specifically their minimal sufficiency for determining pure states up to a global phase. It utilizes mathematical proofs and constructions to establish the bounds.

Result: The results include sharp upper bounds on the size of vital rank-one POVMs: at most (n+1 choose 2) over ℝ and n² over ℂ, along with constructions that achieve these bounds. A connection to block designs is also demonstrated.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by proving sharp upper bounds on the size of vital rank-one POVMs in different dimensions and provides constructions that attain these bounds. It also explores a connection to block designs in the real case.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography seeks to reconstruct an unknown state from measurement statistics. A finite measurement (POVM) is \emph{pure-state informationally complete} (PSI-Complete) if the outcome probabilities determine any pure state up to a global phase. We study \emph{rank-one} POVMs that are minimally sufficient for this task. We call such a POVM \emph{vital} if it is PSI-Complete but every proper subcollection is not PSI-Complete.
  We prove sharp upper bounds on the size of vital rank-one POVMs in dimension \(n\): the size is at most \(\binom{n+1}{2}\) over \(\mathbb{R}\) and at most \(n^{2}\) over \(\mathbb{C}\), and we give constructions that attain these bounds. In the real case, we further exhibit a connection to block designs: whenever \(w \mid n(n-1)\), an \((n,w,w-1)\) design produces a vital rank-one POVM with \(n + n(n-1)/w\) outcomes. We provide explicit constructions for \(w=2,n-1\), and \(n\).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to clarify entanglement, a fundamental yet counterintuitive quantum phenomenon, and distinguish it from classical correlations, while making it accessible to a broad audience.

Method: The tutorial approach involves explaining entanglement through illustrative examples (e.g., Schrödinger's cat), reviewing key criteria like Heisenberg-type uncertainty relations and the CHSH inequality, and discussing operational entanglement witnesses.

Result: The paper provides tools and examples to help readers understand and experimentally verify quantum entanglement, highlighting its distinction from classical correlations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding entanglement as a foundational concept in quantum mechanics and its practical applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Entanglement, a defining property of quantum mechanics in which two physical subsystems cannot be seen as independent entities, challenges our everyday experience and classical intuition. However, only such strong quantum correlations enable quantum technologies, including quantum computing or communication, while revealing the limits of our classical worldview by violating local realism. Given its importance in modern quantum science, we present this tutorial addressing the questions: What is entanglement, how does it differ from classical correlations, and how can it be experimentally verified? Using celebrated examples, such as Schrödinger's cat, we highlight the distinction between classical and quantum correlations and illustrate the definition of entangled and separable states. We review entanglement criteria by discussing Heisenberg-type uncertainty relations for continuous variables and the CHSH inequality for discrete systems. Focusing on concepts of quantum correlations and operational entanglement witnesses, we provide accessible tools and illustrative examples aimed at demystifying entanglement for a broad readership.

TL;DR: A new framework for quantum compilation in topological systems is introduced, demonstrated with the controlled-NOT gate in a non-semisimple Ising system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of explicitly constructing quantum gates in topological quantum computing, where proofs of universal quantum computation were previously existential.

Method: Application of Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming to the quantum compilation problem, specifically using braiding operations in a non-semisimple Ising topological system.

Result: Successful demonstration of the framework's utility by constructing the controlled-NOT operation and its local equivalence class.

Conclusion: The Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming framework is effective for explicitly constructing quantum gates in topological systems, as demonstrated with the controlled-NOT operation in the non-semisimple Ising system.

Abstract: We introduce the Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming framework for the quantum compilation problem and apply it in the context of topological quantum computing. In this setting, quantum gates are realized by sequences of elementary braids of quasiparticles with exotic fractional statistics in certain two-dimensional topological condensed matter systems, described by effective topological quantum field theories. We specifically focus on a non-semisimple version of topological field theory, which provides a foundation for an extended theory of Ising anyons and which has recently been shown by Iulianelli et al., Nature Communications {\bf 16}, 6408 (2025), to permit universal quantum computation. While the proofs of this pioneering result are existential in nature, the mixed integer programming provides an approach to explicitly construct quantum gates in topological systems. We demonstrate this by focusing specifically on the entangling controlled-NOT operation, and its local equivalence class, using braiding operations in the non-semisimple Ising system. This illustrates the utility of the Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming for topological quantum compilation.

*John Bostanci,Jonas Haferkamp,Chinmay Nirkhe,Mark Zhandry*

TL;DR: The paper constructs a classical oracle proving QMA is strictly larger than QCMA via spectral Forrelation, using query complexity and compressed oracle techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and demonstrate the inherent differences between quantum verifiers with quantum witnesses (QMA) and those with classical witnesses (QCMA), by constructing a relativized separation between the two complexity classes.

Method: The paper employs a classical oracle for the spectral Forrelation problem, leverages query complexity insights, and introduces a 'second quantization' perspective on compressed oracle techniques to prove lower bounds.

Result: A classical oracle is constructed showing that QMA strictly contains QCMA, with spectral Forrelation as the separating problem. The proof involves novel techniques in query complexity and compressed oracles.

Conclusion: The paper successfully constructs a classical oracle proving that QMA problems are strictly more expressive than QCMA in a relativized setting, introducing the novel problem of spectral Forrelation to demonstrate this separation.

Abstract: We construct a classical oracle proving that, in a relativized setting, the set of languages decidable by an efficient quantum verifier with a quantum witness (QMA) is strictly bigger than those decidable with access only to a classical witness (QCMA). The separating classical oracle we construct is for a decision problem we coin spectral Forrelation -- the oracle describes two subsets of the boolean hypercube, and the computational task is to decide if there exists a quantum state whose standard basis measurement distribution is well supported on one subset while its Fourier basis measurement distribution is well supported on the other subset. This is equivalent to estimating the spectral norm of a "Forrelation" matrix between two sets that are accessible through membership queries.
  Our lower bound derives from a simple observation that a query algorithm with a classical witness can be run multiple times to generate many samples from a distribution, while a quantum witness is a "use once" object. This observation allows us to reduce proving a QCMA lower bound to proving a sampling hardness result which does not simultaneously prove a QMA lower bound. To prove said sampling hardness result for QCMA, we observe that quantum access to the oracle can be compressed by expressing the problem in terms of bosons -- a novel "second quantization" perspective on compressed oracle techniques, which may be of independent interest. Using this compressed perspective on the sampling problem, we prove the sampling hardness result, completing the proof.

TL;DR: The phonon thermal Hall effect in SrTiO$_3$ is intrinsic, sensitive to disorder, and not linked to parasitic signals, as shown by annealing and contact experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The phonon thermal Hall effect is poorly understood despite its ubiquity in insulators, with significant sample-dependent variations suggesting uncontrolled experimental parameters.

Method: Using SrTiO$_3$ as a model system, the researchers analyzed the impact of disorder, strain, and annealing on the thermal Hall effect, alongside measurements with metallic and insulating contacts.

Result: High thermal conductivity crystals show a substantial thermal Hall angle, while disordered samples exhibit virtually no effect. Annealing restores the effect partially without affecting longitudinal thermal conductivity.

Conclusion: The study highlights the phonon thermal Hall effect as an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice, highly sensitive to disorder and strain, and not simply dependent on phonon mean free path. It also rules out parasitic signals as the origin of the effect.

Abstract: The phonon thermal Hall effect (THE) is a ubiquitous yet poorly understood phenomenon in insulators. Its microscopic origin remains debated, partly due to significant sample-dependent variations that hint at uncontrolled experimental parameters. Using SrTiO$_3$ as a model system, we identify disorder and uncontrolled strain as suppressors of a thermal Hall signal. Crystals with high thermal conductivity exhibit a substantial thermal Hall angle $\nabla T_y / \nabla T_x$ (up to 0.3\% at 9 T), whereas the effect is virtually absent in disordered samples. Crucially, annealing (in air atmosphere) these disordered samples partially restores the THE (approximately 0.1\% at 9 T) with little effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity. This decoupling reveals that the amplitude of THE is not simply set by the phonon mean free path. Furthermore, measurements performed with metallic and insulating contacts yield identical results on the same sample. This definitively rules out parasitic signals as the effect's origin. Our work, by establishing the phonon THE as an intrinsic property of the crystal lattice and extremely sensitive to disorder, sharply constrains theoretical scenarios.

Result: Two distinct antiferromagnetic transitions were observed at 4.1 and 5.9 K, along with multiple metamagnetic transitions between magnetization plateaus. Fermi surface reconstruction was suggested by anomalous Hall contributions at low temperatures.

Conclusion: The study establishes Ce3ScBi5 and related materials as a unique platform for exploring low-dimensional quantum fluctuations in bulk crystals, emphasizing the role of geometric frustration in Kondo and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida frameworks.

Abstract: Kondo metals with geometric frustration offer fertile ground for exploring exotic states of matter with a field-induced fractional magnetization platform and nonsaturating magnetoresistance. Herein, a Ce3ScBi5 single crystal with anti-Hf5Sn3Cu hexagonal structure was successfully synthesized via the bismuth self-flux method, leading to the formation of cerium cations arranged in a frustrated structure within a distorted kagome lattice. Magnetic measurements exhibit two distinct antiferromagnetic transitions at 4.1 and 5.9 K. Specifically, the occurrence of multiple metamagnetic transitions between magnetization plateaus is evidenced upon applying magnetic fields perpendicular to the c axis. Transport measurements highlight remarkable Kondo-lattice characteristics and anisotropic magnetoresistance in Ce3ScBi5. The anomalous Hall contributions are observed at low temperatures under critical fields, suggesting Fermi surface reconstruction in a subset of the metamagnetic transitions. We have constructed a temperature-field phase diagram to provide comprehensive information on the complex magnetic structures arising from competitive interactions. Our work establishes Ce3ScBi5 and related materials as a unique platform for exploring low-dimensional quantum fluctuations in bulk crystals, and analyzes the critical role of geometric frustration in Kondo and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida physical frameworks.

Result: The study reveals noncollinear AFM moments confined within Q2D kagome planes with minimal in-plane anisotropy and strong AFM coupling in Q1D zigzag chains, partially due to RKKY interaction.

Conclusion: The study highlights the promising potential of the Ln3ScBi5 family for investigating mixed-dimensional frustration, with Pr3ScBi5 showing unique magnetic ground states and spin fluctuations influenced by its mixed-dimensional structure.

Abstract: Low-dimensional physics provides profound insights into strongly correlated interactions, leading to enhanced quantum effects and the emergence of exotic quantum states. The Ln3ScBi5 family stands out as a chemically versatile kagome platform with mixed low-dimensional structural framework and tunable physical properties. Our research initiates with a comprehensive evaluation of the currently known Ln3ScBi5 (Ln = La-Nd, Sm) materials, providing a robust methodology for assessing their stability frontiers within this system. Focusing on Pr3ScBi5, we investigate the influence of the zigzag chains of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) motifs and the distorted kagome layers of quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) networks in the mixed-dimensional structure on the intricate magnetic ground states and unique spin fluctuations. Our study reveals that the noncollinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) moments of Pr3+ ions are confined within the Q2D kagome planes, displaying minimal in-plane anisotropy. In contrast, a strong AFM coupling is observed within the Q1D zigzag chains, significantly constraining spin motion. Notably, the magnetic frustration is partially the consequence of coupling to conduction electrons via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) interaction, highlighting a promising framework for future investigations into mixed-dimensional frustration in Ln3ScBi5 systems.

Conclusion: 通过模拟相关参考模型并利用有限尺寸标度分析，该方法为研究存在符号问题的系统中的相变提供了新框架。

Abstract: The sign-problematic generalized Baxter-Wu (GBW) model with asymmetric complex couplings is mapped onto a one-dimensional quantum model. Utilizing the model's exactly known critical properties, we study the relation between the conventional and the modified average signs and the phase transitions in the GBW model. We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume. We propose that the universal properties of the original model can be investigated through simulating the related reference model, based on the universality assumption. Using finite-size scaling analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the validity of this method, which thereby provides a novel framework for investigating phase transitions in systems plagued by the sign problem.

Motivation: To understand the emergence of weak ergodicity breaking in quantum many-body systems following quenches, specifically addressing contradictions in the literature.

Method: The study investigates the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum $O(n)$ models on a lattice, revisiting previous contradictory results.

Result: The study demonstrates that lattice discretization leads to weak ergodicity breaking and resolves contradictions in universal scaling and equilibration results.

Conclusion: The study concludes that lattice discretization is a key factor in the emergence of weak ergodicity breaking in quantum quenches, and resolves previous contradictions by accounting for lattice effects.

Abstract: Sudden quenches in quantum many-body systems often lead to dynamical evolutions that unveil surprising physical behaviors. In this work, we argue that the emergence of weak ergodicity breaking following quantum quenches in certain local many-body systems is a direct consequence of lattice discretization. To support this claim, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum $O(n)$ models on a lattice. In doing so, we also revisit two puzzling results in the literature on quantum $O(n)$ models, concerning universal scaling and equilibration, and demonstrate how these apparent contradictions can be resolved by properly accounting for lattice effects.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian PT-symmetric models have been extensively studied in recent years. Following the seminal work that reduced classical random matrix ensembles to a tridiagonal form, several efforts have aimed to generalize this framework to non-Hermitian extensions of the so-called \b{eta}-ensembles. In particular, while the transition of eigenvalues from the real axis to the complex plane has been well characterized for the \b{eta}-Hermite ensemble under symmetry breaking, the behavior of the \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble in a similar non-Hermitian setting remains
  less understood. In this work, we investigate an ensemble of unstable matrices isospectral to the \b{eta}-Laguerre ensemble. Introducing a small non-Hermitian perturbation breaks the symmetry and drives the eigenvalues into the complex plane. We derive analytical expressions for the loci of complex-conjugate eigenvalue pairs, which organize into a balloon-like structure in the complex plane, followed by a discrete finite line of real eigenvalues. The asymptotic behavior of these eigenvalues is analyzed in the large matrix-size limit, and our theoretical predictions are supported by numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The thesis explores the behavior of physical systems in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, highlighting the emergence of memory effects, glassy behavior, and the optimization of connection times between states.

Abstract: This thesis is devoted to the study of physical systems embedded within the field of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Specifically, the state of the systems of interest constitutes a stochastic process that can be externally driven by a set of controllable parameters. On the one hand, for systems in contact with a thermal bath, we have studied the emergence of strong memory effects and glassy behaviour upon varying the bath temperature, and how these are related to the existence of non-equilibrium attractors governing the dynamics. On the other hand, for overdamped harmonic systems, we have studied the problem of minimising the connection time between arbitrary stationary (either equilibrium or non-equilibrium) states, by suitably varying either the bath temperature or the stiffnesses of the potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in a one-dimensional spin-1 chain, despite theoretical prohibitions.

Method: Matrix product state methods and perturbative renormalization group calculations were employed.

Result: Observation of finite perpendicular magnetization, long-range order in correlation functions, and characteristic dynamical structure factor features.

Conclusion: The study reveals a non-perturbative fixed point with distinct critical exponents, suggesting the need for a field-theory approach to improve quantitative results.

Abstract: In this work, we present evidence for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in a nearest-neighbour interacting spin-1 chain tuned to a quantum critical point at $T=0$ between two XY quasi-long-range order phases differing by the spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Despite the one-dimensional nature of the system, which typically prevents such a continuous symmetry breaking due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the presence of a Berry phase term in the quantum model allows us to observe, using matrix product state methods, a finite perpendicular magnetization. Moreover, the quasi-long-range decay of the correlation function becomes truly long-range order, and the dynamical structure factor displays a characteristic Bragg peak together with sharp gapless modes. Our results imply the quantum phase transition has an anomalous dimension of $η\simeq 1$ together with the dynamical critical exponent $z\simeq 3/2$, known from the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class in one dimension. We perform a perturbative renormalization group calculation about the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$ that we could close at second loop order. We find an interacting fixed point with critical exponents distinct from the Ising ones. Together, our findings suggest the nature of the fixed point to be non-perturbative. We propose a field-theory that we believe to improve the quantitative results.

Motivation: Understanding and quantifying the irreversibility and dissipation of non-equilibrium stochastic processes, especially in protein folding dynamics.

Method: Categorizing displacements of individual molecules into groups based on their initial and final positions to measure irreversibility without needing detailed system information.

Result: The irreversibility measurement is sensitive to detailed features of the energy landscape and serves as a lower bound to entropy production.

Conclusion: The method provides a model-free estimate of irreversibility, validated through single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments.

Abstract: Quantifying the irreversibility and dissipation of non-equilibrium processes is crucial to understanding their behavior, assessing their possible capabilities, and characterizing their efficiency. We introduce a physical quantity that quantifies the irreversibility of stochastic Langevin systems from the observation of individual molecules' displacements. Categorizing these displacements into a few groups based on their initial and final position allows us to measure irreversibility precisely without the need to know the forces and magnitude of the fluctuations acting on the system. Our model-free estimate of irreversibility is related to entropy production by a conditional fluctuation theorem and provides a lower bound to the average entropy production. We validate the method on single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments of proteins subject to force ramps. We show that irreversibility is sensitive to detailed features of the energy landscape underlying the protein folding dynamics and suggest how our methods can be employed to unveil key properties of protein folding processes.

Motivation: To understand the equilibrium transition in the DNLS model between homogeneous and localized phases at positive and negative absolute temperatures.

Method: Mean-field theory was applied to analyze the DNLS model, showing its semi-quantitative correctness in the phase diagram and exactness near the transition.

Result: The mean-field approximation is semi-quantitatively accurate across the phase diagram and becomes exact near the transition.

Conclusion: The passage from stable positive-temperature to metastable negative-temperature states in the DNLS model is smooth, as demonstrated by the mean-field theory.

Abstract: The Discrete Non Linear Schrödinger (DNLS) model, due to the existence of two conserved quantities, displays an equilibrium transition between a homogeneous phase at positive absolute temperature and a localized phase at negative absolute temperature. Here, we provide a mean-field theory of DNLS and show that this approximation is semi-quantitatively correct in the whole phase diagram, becoming exact in proximity of the transition. Our mean-field theory shows that the passage from stable positive-temperature to metastable negative-temperature states is smooth.

Motivation: 广义Langevin方程广泛用于粗粒度物理过程建模，但因其包含历史速度积分项，传统的马尔可夫近似模型难以直接应用。本文旨在扩展现有算法以解决这一限制。

Result: 扩展后的算法成功建模了S形粒子在平面基底滑动产生的二维速度过程，并在整个自相关数据非零时间区间内实现了高精度拟合。

Conclusion: 本文的结论是将两种算法扩展到向量值过程可以有效地近似具有记忆项的广义Langevin方程，适用于二维速度过程。这两种算法通过10-20个辅助变量提供了给定自相关数据的非常准确的拟合。

Abstract: The generalized Langevin equation is used as a model for various coarse-grained physical processes, e.g., the time evolution of the velocity of a given larger particle in an implicitly represented solvent, when the relevant time scales of the dynamics of the larger particle and the solvent particles are not strictly separated. Since this equation involves an integrated history of past velocities, considerable efforts have been made to approximate this dynamics by data-driven Markov models, where auxiliary variables are used to compensate for the memory term. In recent works we have developed two algorithms which can be used for this purpose, provided the dynamics in question are scalar processes. Here we extend these algorithms to vector-valued processes. As a physical test bed we consider an S-shaped particle sliding on a planar substrate, which gives rise to a truly two-dimensional velocity process. The two algorithms provide Markov approximations of this process with 10-20 auxiliary variables and a very accurate fit of the given autocorrelation data over the entire time interval where these data are non-negligible.

### [66] [Discontinuous transition in explosive percolation via local suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09225)
*Young Sul Cho*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: A discontinuous transition occurs in an explosive percolation model with finite local rewiring, challenging the need for global information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether a discontinuous transition can occur in a percolation model with limited local information (finite rewiring nodes) and link rewiring, challenging the previous assumption that global information was necessary for such transitions.

Method: The model involves randomly adding a link and allowing neighboring nodes to rewire their links to suppress the growth of large clusters, starting from the node closest to the added link.

Result: A discontinuous transition emerges even when the total number of rewiring nodes after each link addition is finite, proving that local information combined with rewiring can induce such transitions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a discontinuous transition can emerge in an explosive percolation model even with finite local information and link rewiring, extending previous findings that required global information without rewiring.

Abstract: We study an explosive percolation model in which a link is randomly added and neighboring nodes sequentially rewire their links to suppress the growth of large clusters. In this manner, the rewiring nodes spread outward starting from the initial node closest to the added link. We show that a discontinuous transition emerges even when the total number of rewiring nodes after each link addition is finite. This finding implies that adding a link using the information of the cluster sizes attached to a finite set of link candidates (local information) can lead to a discontinuous transition if link rewiring is allowed. This result thus extends the previous result that a discontinuous transition arises only when a link is added using the information of the cluster sizes attached to an infinite number of link candidates (global information) in the absence of rewiring.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamic structure factor of a crystal with vacancies and identify the contributions of sound propagation, heat diffusion, and vacancy diffusion to the spectral function.

Method: The spectral function of density fluctuations (dynamic structure factor) was derived from macroscopic transport equations for a monatomic cubic crystal with vacancies.

Result: Analytical expressions for heat and vacancy diffusivities, sound speeds, and damping coefficients were obtained. The resonances in the spectral function include a Brillouin doublet (sound propagation), a central Rayleigh peak (heat diffusion), and a sharp peak (vacancy diffusion).

Conclusion: The theoretical results derived from the macroscopic equations align well with molecular dynamics simulations of a face-centered cubic crystal of hard spheres, confirming the validity of the model.

Abstract: The spectral function of density fluctuations, also known as the dynamic structure factor, of a monatomic cubic crystal with vacancies is derived from the macroscopic equations describing transport in crystalline solids. The resonances of the spectral function are identified as a Brillouin doublet of sound propagation, a central Rayleigh peak of heat diffusion, as for perfect crystals, and another central sharp peak associated with vacancy diffusion. Analytical expressions for the heat and vacancy diffusivities, speeds of sound, and sound damping coefficients are obtained. The theoretical results are compared to molecular dynamics simulations of a face-centered cubic crystal of hard spheres.

*Chenyue Guo,Hongzheng Zhao,Zi Cai*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Dynamical frustration arises in periodically driven frustration-free magnetic systems, causing non-ergodic monopole dynamics and power-law distributed heating times, driven by short-range attractive interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate the spontaneous emergence of dynamical frustration in frustration-free magnetic systems under periodic driving and its implications for the behavior of magnetic monopoles and heating dynamics.

Method: The research employs a classical spin system to explore the emergence of spin-ice physics, focusing on the dynamics of magnetic monopole excitations and the suppression of drive-induced heating.

Result: The findings demonstrate non-ergodic random-walk dynamics of magnetic monopoles with tunable power-law waiting times, accelerated heating at intermediate frequencies, and long-tailed power-law distributed heating times due to drive-induced short-range attractive interactions.

Conclusion: The study reveals that dynamical frustration can emerge in frustration-free magnetic systems under periodic driving, leading to non-ergodic behavior of magnetic monopole excitations and power-law distributed heating dynamics, underpinned by drive-induced short-range attractive interactions.

Abstract: In this study, we show that dynamical frustration can spontaneously emerge in frustration-free magnetic systems under periodic driving. Specifically, we consider a classical spin system and demonstrate the emergence of spin-ice physics when drive-induced heating is well suppressed. In particular, we focus on the dynamics of magnetic monopole excitations, which, in sharp contrast to their equilibrium counterparts, exhibit a non-ergodic stochastic random-walk process with long-tailed, power-law distributed waiting times, where the power-law exponent is tunable by the system's effective temperature. Heating is accelerated at intermediate driving frequencies, and the system eventually heats up to an infinite-temperature state. However, the heating time is extremely sensitive to different initial-state realizations and also follows a long-tailed power-law distribution. We show that a drive-induced short-range attractive interaction between monopoles is responsible for the long-tailed distributions observed in both monopole and heating dynamics.

Motivation: To explore quantum models with exact ground states and understand their degenerate state properties through a tree graph framework.

Method: The protocol involves generating an antiferromagnetic S=1/2 Heisenberg model based on a tree graph, ensuring the ground state matches the product state of singlet dimers.

Result: The model exhibits a unique ground state corresponding to singlet dimers and allows for the construction of models with degenerate ground states.

Conclusion: The protocol achieves a unique ground state as a product state of singlet dimers and also enables the construction of models with massively degenerate ground states.

Abstract: We propose a protocol to generate an antiferromagnetic S=1/2 Heisenberg model with the exact ground state based on a tree graph.

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Cluster tomography efficiently locates and characterizes phase transitions in active systems using spatial and temporal analyses, offering a new tool for non-equilibrium studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an alternative higher-order tool beyond two-point correlation functions for locating and characterizing phase transitions in active systems.

Method: Cluster tomography, including spatial cluster tomography for geometric features and temporal cluster tomography for dynamic behavior, is introduced and applied to motility-induced phase separation.

Result: Spatial cluster tomography measures critical exponents without system-specific order parameters, while temporal cluster tomography captures dynamics through a generalization of burstiness analysis.

Conclusion: Cluster tomography, both spatial and temporal, provides a powerful and easy-to-implement tool for studying phase transitions in active systems, enriching the standard toolbox of statistical physics.

Abstract: Critical phase transitions have proven to be a powerful concept to capture the phenomenology of many systems, including deeply non-equilibrium ones like living systems. The study of these phase transitions has overwhelmingly relied on two-point correlation functions. In this Letter, we show that cluster tomography -- the study of one-dimensional cross-sections of the clusters that emerge near a phase transition -- is an alternative higher-order tool that efficiently locates and characterizes phase transitions in active systems. First, using motility-induced phase separation as a paradigmatic example, we show how complex geometric features of clusters, captured by spatial cluster tomography, can be used to measure critical exponents in active systems without explicitly introducing system-specific order parameters. Second, we introduce temporal cluster tomography, an analogous cluster-based measurement that characterizes the dynamical behavior of active systems. We show that cluster dynamics can be captured by a generalization of burstiness analysis in complex temporal networks. Both spatial and temporal cluster tomography are easy to implement yet powerful approaches to study non-equilibrium systems, making them useful additions to the standard toolbox of statistical physics.

TL;DR: Boundaries alter mass distribution in Takayasu model; exact solutions show bulk vs. edge power laws and boundary layer effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of finite spatial boundaries on the behavior of diffusing and aggregating particles in the Takayasu model, particularly in one dimension with steady monomer input.

Method: Analytical and numerical study of the Takayasu model under open and periodic boundary conditions, with derivation of exact expressions for steady-state density profiles, correlation functions, and mean-squared density.

Result: A crossover in the single-site mass distribution from bulk to edge power laws is observed, with breakdown of equivalence between boundary conditions for multipoint distributions. The study identifies the role of spatial mass currents in edge anomalies.

Conclusion: The analysis reveals a distinct boundary layer effect in the Takayasu model, demonstrating how spatial mass currents dominate near edges, leading to anomalous power laws in the single-site mass distribution. The findings are generalized to mass-dependent diffusion.

Abstract: We analytically and numerically study the effect of finite spatial boundaries on the Takayasu model of diffusing and aggregating particles with steady monomer input in one dimension. Exact expressions are derived for the steady-state density profile, two-point correlation functions, and mean-squared density under both open and periodic boundary conditions. The single-site mass distribution exhibits a crossover from a bulk power law $P(m)\sim m^{-4/3}$ to an edge power law $P(m)\sim m^{-5/3}$, occurring near the boundaries or the condensate that forms in periodic systems. The equivalence between the two boundary conditions is shown to break down in the case of multipoint probability distributions near the edge. The exact solution identifies a distinct boundary layer and shows that the edge anomaly arises when spatial mass currents, which scale as $\mathcal{O}(L)$, dominate over the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant flux in mass space. We further generalize these results to mass-dependent diffusion.

Motivation: Explore the hybrid pairing of singlet s-wave and triplet p-wave in a Weyl semimetal and understand the emergent superconducting states.

Method: Self-consistent method applied on a two-orbital type-II time-reversal-symmetric Weyl semimetal.

Result: Hybrid pairings are governed by distinct surface Fermi-arc configurations: s-wave dominates on the bottom surface, while p-wave prevails on the top. The superconducting state is second-order topological with hinge states.

Conclusion: Type-II time-reversal-invariant Weyl semimetals are identified as a promising intrinsic platform for realizing unconventional and topological superconductivity.

Abstract: We employed the self-consistent method on a two-orbital type-II time-reversal-symmetric Weyl semimetal, revealing a hybrid pairing of singlet $s$-wave and triplet $p$-wave. We present a detailed analysis of the normal-state electronic structure and the self-consistent results. Our findings indicate that the selection of hybrid pairings is governed by distinct surface Fermi-arc configurations: specifically, $s$-wave pairing dominates on the bottom surface, while $p$-wave pairing prevails on the top. Furthermore, the emergent superconducting state is a second-order topological superconductors with hinge states in the system. Our results identify type-II time-reversal-invariant Weyl semimetals as a promising intrinsic platform for realizing unconventional and topological superconductivity.

Method: 通过系统的第一性原理计算，研究了二维氢化三层金属硼化物（MB$_4$H; M = Be, Mg, Ca, Al）的电子结构和超导性质，包括电子声子耦合和费米面拓扑变化。

Result: 氢化显著改变了能带结构和费米面拓扑，部分材料展现出双能隙超导性，其中CaB$_4$H表现出最高的T_c（64K）。

Conclusion: 氢化金属硼化物展现出了可调控的超导性质，尤其是CaB$_4$H的64K高温超导性，为高T_c超导体研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in MgB$_2$ (\(T_c = 39\) K) \cite{nagamatsu2001superconductivity} established metal diborides (MB$_2$) as a promising class of conventional superconductors. Recent advances in fabrication techniques have enabled the synthesis of 2D MgB$_2$ with a \(T_c\) of 36 K \cite{cheng2018fabrication}, reigniting interest in layered metal borides. This has led to predictions of superconductivity in various 2D metal borides, including MB$_4$ (M = Be, Mg, Ca, Al), with CaB$_4$ exhibiting the highest estimated \(T_c\) of 36.1 K. To explore the impact of hydrogenation on superconductivity, we systematically investigate two-dimensional hydrogenated trilayer metal borides (MB$_4$H; M = Be, Mg, Ca, Al). Our results reveal that these materials retain a metallic nature dominated by boron \(p\)-orbitals, while hydrogenation significantly alters their band dispersion and Fermi surface topology. Phonon calculations confirm their dynamical stability and reveal strong electron-phonon interactions, leading to multi-gap superconductivity. Among the studied compounds, MgB$_4$H, AlB$_4$H, and CaB$_4$H exhibit possible two superconducting gaps, with CaB$_4$H showing the strongest electron-phonon coupling, resulting in an intrinsic superconducting transition temperature of 64 K. In contrast, AlB$_4$H shows the weakest coupling, with \(T_c = 22\) K. The calculated electron-phonon coupling constants (\(λ\)) range from 0.62 to 0.99, demonstrating the tunability of superconducting properties through elemental substitution. These findings provide valuable insights into superconductivity in hydrogenated metal borides and highlight their potential for high-\(T_c\) applications.

TL;DR: First-principles study confirms conventional superconductivity in quasicrystal approximants and predicts higher $T_\text{c}$ in related alloys, suggesting similar potential for parent quasicrystals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the contradiction between the unconventional structure of quasicrystals (QCs) and their observed conventional $s$-wave superconductivity.

Method: First-principles calculations using state-of-the-art ab initio methods to compute superconducting properties of Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and predict properties of related alloys.

Result: Successful quantitative reproduction of bulk $T_\text{c}$ for Al$_{13}$Os$_4$, prediction of higher $T_\text{c}$ in Al$_{13}$Re$_4$, and establishment of bounds for QC superconductivity.

Conclusion: The study confirms the applicability of the electron-phonon framework in approximant crystals (ACs) and predicts tunable superconductivity in Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Re$_x$ and Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Ir$_x$, suggesting potential for higher $T_\text{c}$ in their quasicrystalline counterparts.

Abstract: Quasicrystals (QCs) host long-range order without translational symmetry, a regime in which the very foundations of BCS theory are not straightforwardly applicable, yet experiments on QCs and their approximant crystals (ACs) point to conventional, $s$-wave, electron-phonon coupled superconductivity. With this work we directly address this seeming contradiction from first principles. Using state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} methods, we compute the superconducting properties of the recently discovered AC Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and quantitatively reproduce its bulk $T_\text{c}$. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first \emph{ab initio} determination of $T_\text{c}$ for an AC and establishes that the electron-phonon framework is predictive in these systems as well. Using the generalized quasichemical approximation for alloy modeling in the decagonal Al-Os family, we predict tunable superconductivity in Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Re$_x$ and Al$_{13}$Os$_{4-x}$Ir$_x$; in particular, Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ is dynamically stable and estimated to have a $T_\text{c}$ about 30% above Al$_{13}$Os$_4$. Finally, we argue that $T_\text{c}$ obtained for ACs provides practical bounds for the $T_\text{c}$ of their parent QCs, suggesting that the quasicrystalline counterparts of Al$_{13}$Os$_4$ and Al$_{13}$Re$_4$ could harbor the highest $T_\text{c}$ among QCs yet.

Motivation: The origin of the chiral charge density wave (CDW) in kagome metals and superconductors, which leads to unconventional electronic states, remains unresolved.

Method: Spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy was used to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5, where the CDW is suppressed, revealing chiral-nematic Fermi surfaces and quasiparticle dispersions.

Result: Discovery of a chiral-nematic Fermi liquid parent state, confirmed by chiral quasiparticle dispersions and direct transitions to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Residual chiral-nematic QPI features in CDW samples further support this parent state.

Conclusion: The study identifies a chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state as the parent state of chiral CDW and superconductivity in kagome metals, offering a new framework for understanding exotic quantum phases.

Abstract: The kagome metals and superconductors hosting rich correlated and topological electronic states have captivated quantum materials research. These states are triggered by an unconventional chiral charge density wave (CDW) wherein a chiral superconductivity emerges at low temperatures, yet the origin of this chiral CDW order, the parent state, is unresolved. Here, we report the discovery of a parent chiral-nematic Fermi liquid state in kagome metals and superconductors. We use spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study Ti-doped CsV3Sb5 where the CDW is suppressed, and find that multiorbital Fermi surfaces break all mirror reflections and exhibit handedness. We observe the chiral low-energy quasiparticle dispersions, providing direct evidence for a chiral-nematic electronic structure. We further observe the direct transition from the parent state to a chiral-nematic superconducting state. Moreover, in the samples with chiral CDW, we also observe the residual chiral-nematic QPI features, demonstrating that the CDW-triggered exotic states descend from the chiral-nematic Fermi liquid. Our findings not only provide a plausible chiral-nematic parent state, but also establish a new conceptual framework for exploring the emergence and consequences of such exotic quantum phases.

Motivation: To compare interaction strengths in infinite-layer PrNiO$_2$ and SrCuO$_2$ to understand their unconventional superconductivity properties better.

Method: Combined X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) were used to study orbital and magnetic excitations, with dispersions analyzed along high-symmetry directions. A single-band Hubbard model including higher-order exchange interactions was applied to derive the correlation factor $U/t$.

Result: PrNiO$_2$ shows a 20% stronger correlation strength than SrCuO$_2$, despite having a smaller Coulomb repulsion.

Conclusion: The study suggests that moderating correlation strength could further optimize superconductivity in nickelates, as PrNiO$_2$ exhibits a 20% stronger correlation strength than SrCuO$_2$ despite a smaller Coulomb repulsion.

Abstract: Optimization of unconventional superconductivity involves a balance of interaction strengths. Precise determination of correlation strength across different material families is therefore important. Here, we present a combined X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) study of infinite-layer PrNiO$_2$ and SrCuO$_2$ that enables fair comparison of their interaction strengths. For both compounds, we study the orbital and magnetic excitations and extract their dispersions along high-symmetry directions. Using a single-band Hubbard model and including higher-order exchange interactions, we derive the correlation factor $U/t$ for both compounds. A key finding is that despite a smaller Coulomb repulsion $U$, PrNiO$_2$ exhibits a correlation strength that is 20% stronger than that of its isostructural cuprate counterpart SrCuO$_2$. This indicates that a moderation of the correlation strength may further optimize superconductivity in nickelates.
