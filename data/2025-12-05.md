*Rhonald Burgos Atencia*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for a versatile approach to compute band-geometric quantities in multiband systems with arbitrary SU(2) representations, including multifold fermions and gapped SU(2) models.

Method: A unified framework is developed to compute band-geometric quantities in multiband systems, utilizing the Wigner-Eckart theorem to identify allowed interband matrix elements and derive compact analytic expressions for the quantum geometric tensor, orbital magnetic moment, and orbital transport coefficients.

Result: The framework is applied to SU(3) and SU(4) systems, where orbital Edelstein and orbital Hall responses arise naturally from the antisymmetric components of the band geometry, showcasing its practical utility.

Conclusion: The study reveals a universal link between the algebraic structure of the Hamiltonian and emergent orbitronic phenomena, demonstrated through explicit calculations in SU(3) and SU(4) settings.

Abstract: We develop a unified framework to compute band-geometric quantities in multiband systems whose low-energy Hamiltonians realize arbitrary $SU(2)$ representations. Exploiting the presence of a quantization axis, we use the Wigner--Eckart theorem to identify the allowed interband matrix elements and obtain compact analytic expressions for the quantum geometric tensor, the orbital magnetic moment, and the resulting orbital transport coefficients. The formalism applies to both multifold fermions and gapped $SU(2)$ models. Its versatility is demonstrated through explicit calculations in representative $SU(3)$ and $SU(4)$ settings, where orbital Edelstein and orbital Hall responses arise naturally from the antisymmetric components of the band geometry. Our results reveal a universal link between the algebraic structure of the Hamiltonian and emergent orbitronic phenomena.

*Benjamin Remez,Pouyan Ghaemi,Jay D. Sau,Mohammad Hafezi*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model for light-Andreev interaction, showing how Andreev bound states can act as optical-to-microwave transducers, promising advancements in Andreev optoelectronics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the interaction of Andreev bound states with light, leveraging the maturation of superconductor-semiconductor hybrid junctions.

Method: Introduction of a model for light-Andreev interaction, highlighting distinct features such as two optical absorption resonances separated by twice the bound state energy.

Result: Demonstration of how Andreev bound states can operate as optical-to-microwave transducers, with realistic device parameters.

Conclusion: Andreev bound states can serve as optical-to-microwave transducers, opening new possibilities in the field of Andreev optoelectronics.

Abstract: Superconducting weak-link junctions host electron--hole hybridized excitations called Andreev bound states. These have attracted significant interest for the role they play in the device microelectronic operation and for quantum information applications. Andreev physics has so far been synonymous with the microwave range. However, the maturation of superconductor--semiconductor hybrid junctions opens the door to the characterization, and manipulation, of Andreev states by light. Here we introduce a model for light--Andreev interaction, with distinct features: Electrons transitioning into Andreev levels can sidestep Pauli exclusion, resulting in two optical absorption resonances separated by twice the bound state energy. One resonance populates the Andreev state and the other empties it; pumping both resets the junction and prevents saturation. Given their natural microwave coupling, we show how Andreev bound states can operate as optical--to--microwave transducers. We illustrate these effects with realistic device parameters. Our results highlight the possibilities in the new field of Andreev optoelectronics.

### [3] [In-plane anomalous features in the 3D quantum Hall regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04353)
*Ming Lu,Xiao-Xiao Zhang*

TL;DR: New 3D QHE features under in-plane magnetic field include unique Hall oscillations, antichiral transmission, and tunable quantization, revealing hidden transport properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new features of the 3D quantum Hall effect that differ from the well-established 2D QHE, particularly under an in-plane magnetic field in a 3D Weyl semimetal.

Method: Analyzing the response of a 3D Weyl semimetal in the quantum Hall regime to an in-plane magnetic field, including Hall quantum oscillations and unconventional antichiral transmission.

Result: Discovery of unexpected Hall quantum oscillations, unquantized two-terminal magnetoresistance, disorder-robust negative longitudinal resistance, and quantization tunable by lead configuration.

Conclusion: The study reveals hidden 3D quantum Hall effect (QHE) transport properties, demonstrating a breakdown of the topological characterization even with 3D Chern numbers, and opens a new class of transport measurements and phenomena.

Abstract: Studies of the 3D quantum Hall effect (QHE) have primarily emphasized transport features that mimic the well-established 2D QHE. In this work, we show that qualitatively new features arise when an in-plane magnetic field is applied to a 3D Weyl semimetal in the quantum Hall regime. An unexpected Hall quantum oscillation, distinct from the Weyl-orbit oscillation, coexists with the QHE, along with an unquantized two-terminal magnetoresistance. Moreover, unconventional antichiral transmission enables a peculiar disorder-robust negative longitudinal resistance. Quantization tunable by the lead configuration is further found in this transport geometry. A unique type of nonlocal quantum backscattering channels underlies these phenomena. Our work demonstrates a breakdown of the topological characterization of transport even with 3D Chern numbers and reveals hidden 3D QHE transport properties. It opens a new class of transport measurements and phenomena.

### [4] [Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors: a review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04387)
*Yuri D. Glinka*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A review advocating a 'solid-state' approach for transient absorption spectroscopy in 2D semiconductors, addressing misinterpretations and experimental errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent experimental errors and misinterpretations in ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy when applied to 2D semiconductors, due to their unique nature and varied experimental setups.

Method: The paper reviews recent experimental results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy applied to 2D semiconductors across a wide spectral range (THz to UV).

Result: It consolidates findings from 'solid-state' interpretations of transient absorption spectra, contrasting with the traditional 'molecular' approach, and identifies typical errors in measurement and data processing.

Conclusion: The review emphasizes the need for a 'solid-state' approach to interpret transient absorption spectroscopy in 2D semiconductors, highlighting common experimental and interpretive errors.

Abstract: Despite the decades that have passed since the discovery of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and its apparent simplicity, this method is still often subject to experimental errors and misinterpretations when applied to 2D semiconductors. The reason for this lies not only in the unique nature of these extremely thin samples, but also in the different experimental configurations and data processing methods used. Moreover, since this type of spectroscopy was originally used to characterize the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carriers in chemical compounds, colloidal nanostructures and gas molecules, a purely 'molecular' approach to interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors is often proposed. However, this approach is fundamentally inapplicable to thin-film semiconductors grown or mechanically exfoliated on transparent substrates. This review considers the recent experimental results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors in a wide spectral range from several THz to UV (~1000 THz) based on the 'solid-state' approach to their interpretation. We also highlight typical errors that arise in measuring, processing and interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors.

*Amadeusz Dydniański,Mateusz Raczyński,Aleksandra Łopion,Tomasz Kazimierczuk,Jacek Kasprzak,Karolina Ewa Połczyńska,Wojciech Pacuski,Piotr Kossacki*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Study shows certain metals (Au, Ni) flip p-type CdTe quantum wells to n-type via surface passivation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how different contact materials affect the local charge properties of p-type CdTe-based quantum wells.

Method: Magneto-spectroscopy was used to monitor Zeeman shifts at singlet-triplet transitions for five different metals (Au, Ag, Cr, Ni, Ti) deposited as 10 nm layers on the sample surface.

Result: Most metals retained the original p-type doping, while gold and nickel coverage flipped the local doping to n-type due to their robust bonding and efficient surface passivation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that contact materials significantly influence the local charge properties of p-type CdTe-based quantum wells, with gold and nickel being particularly effective in flipping the doping type to n-type.

Abstract: In this work we look into how the contact material influences the local charge properties of a p-type CdTe-based quantum well. We study five metals deposited as 10 nm layers on the sample surface: Au, Ag, Cr, Ni and Ti. We use magneto-spectroscopy to discriminate their charge states through monitoring the Zeeman shifts at singlet-triplet transitions. Most tested metals retain the original p-type of the QW, while gold and nickel coverage flips the local doping to n-type. This is attributed to a robust bonding of these two metals to the semiconductor, efficiently passivating its surface and thus improving electron diffusion from the metal to the quantum well.

### [6] [Exact and mean-field analysis of the role of Hubbard interactions on flux driven circular current in a quantum ring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04736)
*Rahul Samanta,Santanu K. Maiti,Shreekantha Sil*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Persistent current in Hubbard rings is studied using exact diagonalization and Hartree-Fock, showing how interactions, disorder, and filling modulate it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to systematically analyze the influence of on-site and extended Hubbard interactions, disorder, and electron filling on persistent current in quantum rings, introducing a novel linear table formalism for the Hamiltonian.

Method: The research employs exact diagonalization and the Hartree-Fock mean-field approach within the tight-binding framework. A linear table formalism is introduced to construct the full many-body Hamiltonian.

Result: In ordered rings, current decreases with on-site repulsion, while extended interaction affects it differently based on filling. Disorder modifies these behaviors, enhancing current at low fillings.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the persistent current in Hubbard quantum rings is significantly influenced by on-site and extended Hubbard interactions, disorder, and electron filling. The interplay between these factors, especially near half-filling, plays a crucial role in modulating the current.

Abstract: We investigate circular current in both ordered and disordered Hubbard quantum rings threaded by magnetic flux, employing exact diagonalization and the Hartree-Fock mean-field approach within the tight-binding framework. The influence of on-site and extended Hubbard interactions, disorder, and electron filling on the persistent current is systematically analyzed. To construct the full many-body Hamiltonian, we introduce a linear table formalism, which, to our knowledge, has been rarely used in this context. In ordered rings, the current decreases monotonically with increasing on-site repulsion, while the impact of the extended interaction depends strongly on the filling factor. At low filling, stronger extended interaction suppresses the current, whereas near half-filling, it enhances the current up to a critical ratio, half of the on-site strength, before reducing it. Disorder significantly modifies these behaviors, notably enhancing the current at less than quarter-filling with increasing extended interaction. The localization properties of eigenstates, examined via the inverse participation ratio, further support the crucial roles of filling and the interplay between on-site and extended interactions in governing persistent current.

### [7] [Edge spin galvanic effect in altermagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04798)
*L. E. Golub*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Proposal of the edge spin galvanic effect in $d$-wave altermagnets and a pure spin edge photocurrent, both sensitive to edge orientation and spin direction, with potential spintronic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and propose a novel spin-dependent electrical current effect in altermagnets, specifically focusing on edge-driven phenomena and their potential applications in spintronics.

Method: Theoretical proposal and analysis of the edge spin galvanic effect (ESGE) and pure spin edge photocurrent, including their dependence on spin orientation, edge geometry, radiation polarization, and frequency.

Result: Identification of the ESGE current and its reversible nature, along with the discovery of a pure spin edge photocurrent that can be converted into an electric current via an external magnetic field.

Conclusion: The study proposes the edge spin galvanic effect in $d$-wave altermagnets, highlighting its sensitivity to edge orientation and the reversible nature of the current. Additionally, a pure spin edge photocurrent is introduced, with its conversion into an electric current under an external magnetic field.

Abstract: The edge spin galvanic effect (ESGE) in $d$-wave altermagnets is proposed. ESGE is a creation of an electrical current flowing along the edge of the sample, which is driven by the spin orientation of charge carriers. The ESGE current is formed owing to the altermagnetic spin splitting and the scattering of carriers by the edge of the sample. The current is sensitive to the orientation of the edge in respect to the main axes of the altermagnet. The edge spin galvanic current reverses its direction upon a reversal of the non-equilibrium spin direction or the Néel vector. We also propose the pure spin edge photocurrent excited by polarized radiation and formed at the edges of a sample. Its dependence on the radiation polarization and frequency is analyzed. The application of an external magnetic field converts this pure spin photocurrent into an electric current along the edge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore the potential of CrSBr as an intelligent matter capable of encoding, processing, and storing information, with applications in neuromorphic computing.

Method: The study investigated the reconfigurable magnetic multilayer domain structure in CrSBr by applying external magnetic fields and analyzing the resulting magnetic configurations and optical responses.

Result: CrSBr exhibits a hysteretic antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition with tunable intermediate configurations, and its optical properties are directly modulated by its magnetic structure.

Conclusion: CrSBr is a promising candidate for next-generation technologies due to its adaptive magnetic and optical properties, making it suitable for neuromorphic computing and information processing.

Abstract: The emergence of intelligent matter has sparked significant interest in next generation technologies. We report on the discovery of a reconfigurable magnetic multilayer domain structure in the van der Waals magnet CrSBr, exhibiting a unique combination of magnetic and optical properties. Applying an external magnetic field along the easy axis drives the hysteretic antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition that is not universally binary, but instead develops through a cascade of intermediate magnetic configurations whose multiplicity and stability scale systematically with thickness. This material can be considered as a prototypical intelligent matter, capable of encoding, processing, and storing information through its tunable magnetic structure. The directly linked optical properties of CrSBr, modulated by the magnetic structure, provide a readout mechanism for the stored information compatible with modern information distribution using light. With its adaptive properties, CrSBr is an attractive candidate for neuromorphic circuitries, enabling the design of brain-inspired computing architectures that can learn and evolve in response to changing environments.

### [9] [Suppressing metal molecule charge transfer with a phosphorus interlayer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04999)
*Mattia Bassotti,Luca Floreano,Luca Schio,Sergio Salaverria,Dimas G. de Oteyza,Giacomo Giorgi,Frederik Schiller,Alberto Verdini*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A phosphorus interlayer on Cu(110) prevents charge transfer to ZnTPP molecules, preserving their electronic properties, as confirmed by spectroscopic techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of undesired alteration in the electronic properties of porphyrins due to interaction with substrates, by exploring the use of a phosphorus interlayer for electronic decoupling.

Method: A combination of techniques including NEXAFS, XPS, UPS, and STS was employed to analyze the interaction between ZnTPP molecules and the phosphorus interlayer on Cu(110).

Result: The phosphorus interlayer successfully prevented charge transfer from the metal to ZnTPP molecules, effectively preserving their LUMO levels.

Conclusion: The study effectively demonstrates that a phosphorus interlayer on a Cu(110) surface acts as a buffer layer, preventing charge transfer from the metal to ZnTPP molecules and preserving their electronic properties.

Abstract: Porphyrins are organic molecules that exhibit excellent opto-electronics properties, making them suitable for a variety of applications. Nevertheless, their functionality strongly depends on the surface onto which they are deposited, and on the interaction between the molecules and the substrate itself, which often leads to an undesired alteration in their electronic properties. In this study, we use a phosphorus interlayer on a Cu(110) surface as a buffer layer for the electronic decoupling of Zinc-TetraPhenylPorphyrin (ZnTPP) molecules. Using a combination of complementary techniques, such as Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS), X-ray and Ultraviolet Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS, UPS) as well as Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) techniques, it is shown how the charge transfer from the metal, responsible for quenching the ZnTPP lowest unoccupied molecular level (LUMO) levels, is effectively prevented by the presence of a phosphorus reconstruction in between.

### [10] [Hall-like response from anisotropic Fermi surfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05014)
*Abhiram Soori*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Anisotropic Fermi surfaces can generate Hall-like signals without magnetic fields, demonstrated via continuum and lattice models, with responses varying by anisotropy and symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether an anisotropic and rotated Fermi surface can produce a Hall-like transverse response without relying on magnetic fields or Berry curvature.

Method: A two-dimensional continuum model and a lattice model with direction-dependent hoppings were used to study transverse conductivity. The Büttiker-probe method in a multiterminal geometry was employed to compute the Hall voltage.

Result: A finite transverse conductivity was observed, dependent on the degree of anisotropy and rotation angle, vanishing when mirror symmetry is restored. The Hall response varies continuously with band-structure parameters.

Conclusion: The results indicate that anisotropic and rotated Fermi surfaces can generate Hall-like signals without magnetic fields or Berry curvature, offering a symmetry-based approach to engineering such effects in low-symmetry materials.

Abstract: We demonstrate that an anisotropic and rotated Fermi surface can generate a finite Hall-like transverse response in electron transport, even in the absence of a magnetic field or Berry curvature. Using a two-dimensional continuum model, we show that broken $k_y \to -k_y$ symmetry inherent to anistropic band structures leads to a nonzero transverse conductivity. We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the Büttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting Hall voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the Hall response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters. Our results provide a symmetry-based route to engineer Hall-like signals in low-symmetry materials without magnetic fields or topological effects.

### [11] [Global phase diagram of two-dimensional dirty hyperbolic Dirac liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05109)
*Christopher A. Leong,Daniel J. Salib,Bitan Roy*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Dirac-like excitations in hyperbolic lattices are stable against weak disorder but transition to a metallic state and later an Anderson insulator with increasing disorder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand the stability and phase transitions of massless Dirac-like excitations in hyperbolic lattices under the influence of disorder.

Method: The paper employs the kernel polynomial method to analyze the density of states in large hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions.

Result: The results show vanishing average and typical density of states at zero energy for weak disorder, a metallic state at moderate disorder, and an Anderson insulator at strong disorder.

Conclusion: The study concludes that Dirac-like excitations in hyperbolic lattices remain stable against weak disorder, but transition to a metallic state at moderate disorder, ultimately becoming an Anderson insulator with stronger disorder.

Abstract: Within the framework of the canonical nearest-neighbor tight-binding model for spinless fermions, a family of two-dimensional bipartite hyperbolic lattices hosts massless Diraclike excitations near half-filling with the iconic vanishing density of states (DOS) near zero energy. We show that a collection of such ballistic quasiparticles remains stable against sufficiently weak pointlike charge impurities, a feature captured by the vanishing average [$ρ_{a}(0)$] and typical [$ρ_{t}(0)$] DOS at zero energy, computed by employing the kernel polynomial method in sufficiently large $\{ 10, 3\}$ hyperbolic lattices (Schläfli symbol) with more than $10^8$ and $10^5$ sites, respectively, with open boundary conditions. However, at moderate disorder the system enters a metallic state via a continuous quantum phase transition where both $ρ_{a}(0)$ and $ρ_{t}(0)$ become finite. With increasing strength of disorder, ultimately an Anderson insulator sets in, where only $ρ_{t}(0) \to 0$. The resulting phase diagram for dirty Dirac fermions living on a hyperbolic space solely stems from the background negative spatial curvature, as confirmed from the vanishing $ρ_{t}(0)$ for arbitrarily weak disorder on honeycomb lattices, fostering relativistic fermions on a flatland, as the thermodynamic limit is approached.

TL;DR: High-fidelity single qubit control in Si-MOS quantum dots using electron spin resonance, achieving 99.5% gate fidelity despite noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of achieving high-fidelity quantum control in Si-MOS devices, which are promising for scalable quantum computing but face issues like low-frequency noise.

Method: The experiment utilized electron spin resonance in a natural Si-MOS quantum dot fabricated on a 300 mm SOI wafer. Achievements include a high optimal Rabi frequency of 5 MHz, dynamical decoupling from the 29-Si environment, and tracking the qubit frequency to mitigate low-frequency noise.

Result: Key results include a Rabi frequency of 5 MHz, improved TRabi from 7 to 11 μs, Q-factors exceeding 50, and an average single gate control fidelity of 99.5 ± 0.3%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that high-fidelity single qubit control is achievable in Si-MOS quantum dots, even in the presence of low-frequency magnetic noise, by leveraging fast Rabi frequencies, low charge noise, and feedback protocols.

Abstract: We demonstrate high-fidelity single qubit control in a natural Si-MOS quantum dot fabricated in an industrial 300 mm wafer process on a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer using electron spin resonance. A relatively high optimal Rabi frequency of 5 MHz is achieved, dynamically decoupling the electron spin from its 29-Si environment. Tracking the qubit frequency reduces the impact of low frequency noise in the qubit frequency and improves the $T^{Rabi}$ from 7 to 11 $μ$s at a Rabi frequency of 5 MHz, resulting in Q-factors exceeding 50. Randomized benchmarking returns an average single gate control fidelity of 99.5 $\pm$ 0.3%. As a result of pulse-area calibration, this fidelity is limited by the Rabi Q-factor. These results show that a fast Rabi frequency, low charge noise, and a feedback protocol enable high fidelity in these Si-MOS devices, despite the low-frequency magnetic noise.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: STM reveals axionic physics in SmB$_6$ nanowires, showing voltage-induced magnetization and ruling out static magnetism, with implications for spintronics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the elusive axionic $E\cdot B$ term in quantum materials and clarify the origin of spin-polarized currents in SmB$_6$ nanowires.

Method: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) was used to analyze SmB$_6$ nanowires, focusing on voltage-induced magnetization.

Result: Voltage-induced magnetization was observed, with small voltages generating significant tip moments, consistent with axionic electrodynamics.

Conclusion: The study provides direct evidence of axionic physics through STM, highlighting the potential for future applications in spintronics and STM techniques.

Abstract: Discoveries over the past two decades have revealed the remarkable ability of quantum materials to emulate relativistic properties of the vacuum, from Dirac cones in graphene to the Weyl surface states of topological insulators. Yet the most elusive consequence of topology in quantum matter is the axionic $E\cdot B$ term in the electromagnetic response. Here we report a direct signature of axionic physics obtained through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Although recent STM experiments using SmB$_6$ nanowires have been interpreted as evidence for spin-polarized currents arising from topological surface states, we show that the observed spin polarization instead originates from axionic electrodynamics. Our analysis reveals a striking voltage-induced magnetization: extremely small voltages ($\sim$ 30 meV) generate tip moments of order 0.1 $μ_B$ that reverse sign with the applied bias. The magnitude, tunability, and reversibility of this signal are consistent with an axionic $E \cdot B$ coupling, and fully account for the magnetic component of the tip density of states, ruling out static magnetism. Millivolt-scale control of spin polarization in a tunnel junction provides a new route for probing axionic electrodynamics and opens avenues for future STM and spintronics applications.

Motivation: To address limitations of conventional single-mode designs in radio-frequency reflectometry and enhance spin-qubit readout capabilities.

Method: The architecture utilizes a spiral inductor's distributed inter-turn capacitance to create distinct resonant modes, enabling radio-frequency reflectometry at multiple discrete frequencies up to 2 GHz. Quantum dot probing across modes identifies tunneling rates and charge defects, while higher-order modes facilitate single-shot spin readout via an RF-SET.

Conclusion: The multimode superconducting inductor architecture demonstrates scalability and flexibility for fast spin-qubit readout and device-quality characterization, achieving high fidelity and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a multimode superconducting inductor architecture that enables radio-frequency reflectometry at multiple discrete frequencies up to 2 GHz, addressing limitations of conventional single-mode designs. The spiral inductor's distributed inter-turn capacitance yields distinct resonant modes with varied impedance-matching conditions. By probing a quantum dot across several modes, we extract tunneling rates over a broad frequency range and identify signatures of nearby charge defects. Using one of the higher-order modes, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout via a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (RF-SET), achieving singlet-triplet readout with an integration time of 8 us and a readout fidelity of 98%. These results establish multimode inductance as a scalable and flexible component for fast spin-qubit readout and device-quality characterization.

### [15] [Ferroelectric Hysteresis in Superconducting Bilayers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04251)
*Yanfang Li,Xin-Zhi Li,Wen-Yu He*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Study shows hysteretic superconductivity switching in bilayers via interlayer pairing, with conditions P_r < P_c < P_s. Predicts enhanced critical fields and gate-tunable interlayer effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the coupling mechanism between ferroelectricity and superconductivity in bilayer systems, which is crucial for developing low-power, non-volatile memory devices.

Method: The authors derived the Landau Ginzburg free energy expansion for interlayer pairing and analyzed the hysteretic behavior of superconductivity along the ferroelectric hysteresis loop.

Result: The hysteretic switching of superconductivity is shown to result from interlayer pairing, with conditions for coexistence established. Predictions include enhanced critical displacement fields and gate-tunable interlayer crossed Andreev reflection.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the hysteretic switching of superconductivity in a bilayer system arises from interlayer pairing, with specific conditions (P_r < P_c < P_s) for the coexistence of ferroelectricity and superconductivity. Predictions include enhanced critical displacement fields and gate-tunable interlayer crossed Andreev reflection, offering experimental verification pathways.

Abstract: Recently, coexisting ferroelectricity and superconductivity were reported in bilayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer graphene. Importantly, it was observed that an applied displacement field switches the superconductivity with a ferroelectric hysteresis. Such direct coupling between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity offers promising pathways for developing low-power, non-volatile memory devices. However, the coupling mechanism between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that in a superconducting bilayer, the hysteretic switching of superconductivity can arise from an interlayer pairing. By deriving the Landau Ginzburg free energy expansion for the interlayer pairing, we show that along the ferroelectric hysteresis loop, the hysteretic exceeding of the critical polarization $P_{\textrm{c}}$ that destroys the interlayer pairing leads to the hysteretic switching of superconductivity. The condition to have a ferroelectric hysteretic superconducting state is established to be $P_{\textrm{r}}<P_{\textrm{c}}<P_{\textrm{s}}$, where $P_{\textrm{r}}$ and $P_{\textrm{s}}$ denote the remanent and saturated polarization, respectively. Crucially, our scenario of interlayer pairing yields two predictions: (1) an enhancement of the upper critical displacement field with stronger interlayer coupling and (2) a pronounced, gate-tunable interlayer crossed Andreev reflection, both of which provide clear pathways for experimental verification.

TL;DR: Ambient-pressure superconductivity in nickelates reaches ~63 K via extreme non-equilibrium growth, revealing anisotropic-3D behavior and strange-metal traits as an alternative to cuprates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve higher ambient-pressure superconductivity in nickelates, surpassing the previously capped Tc of ~40 K, by leveraging innovative growth techniques and overcoming metastability challenges.

Method: The research utilized extreme non-equilibrium growth of epitaxial (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films under compressive strain, employing gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GAE) combined with powerful in situ oxidation.

Result: A Tc leap to ~63 K was achieved, accompanied by crystalline purity and a systematic evolution in resistivity behavior, linking superconductivity to non-Fermi liquid characteristics.

Conclusion: The study identifies nickelates as an anisotropic-3D high-Tc system with strange-metal behavior, offering an alternative to the quasi-2D cuprate paradigm.

Abstract: Ambient-pressure superconductivity in nickelates has been capped at an onset transition temperature (Tc) of ~40 K, a value that remains lower than the cuprate (~133 K) and iron-based (~55 K) counterparts, despite the promise shown under high pressure. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset at ~63 K in epitaxial (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films grown under compressive strain on SrLaAlO4 substrates. This Tc leap is enabled by pushing our gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GAE) method into an extreme non-equilibrium growth regime. It leverages powerful in situ oxidation to simultaneously enhance kinetics via higher temperatures and achieve full oxygenation without post-annealing. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm that this approach yields films of large-scale crystalline purity, overcoming the inherent metastability of the strained superconducting phase. These films exhibit a systematic evolution in their normal-state resistivity-temperature curve: the power-law exponent $α$ evolves from Fermi-liquid-like ($α$ ~2) at lower Tc to strange-metal-like ($α$ ~1) in higher Tc samples, directly linking the enhanced superconductivity to non-Fermi liquid behavior. Mapping the vortex melting phase diagram by the mutual inductance technique further reveals 2D melting limit suppressed to near zero, which demonstrates significantly stronger interlayer coupling than that of cuprates. These results identify the nickelates as an anisotropic-3D high-Tc system exhibiting strange-metal behavior, presenting an alternative framework to the quasi-2D cuprate paradigm.

TL;DR: An ultrathin gold layer prevents oxidation in Nb-Nb bonding, enabling low-temperature, low-pressure bonding for scalable 3D superconducting quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D interconnects face challenges like wiring congestion, electromagnetic interference, and limited cryogenic space, hindering scalable quantum computing. Nb-Nb bonding is complicated by an oxide layer that degrades qubit coherence, necessitating effective surface engineering to suppress oxidation.

Method: The research introduces an ultrathin gold (Au) capping layer as a passivation strategy to prevent oxygen incorporation at the Nb surface, allowing Nb-Nb thermocompression bonding at 350 °C under reduced pressure (0.495 MPa). Microstructural and interfacial analyses were conducted to confirm the effectiveness of this approach.

Result: The Au capping layer successfully prevents oxide formation, enhancing bonding uniformity and strength while preserving superconductivity. This method enables low-temperature, low-pressure bonding, critical for scalable 3D quantum computing architectures.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that using an ultrathin gold (Au) capping layer effectively suppresses oxidation in Nb-Nb bonding, enabling low-temperature, low-pressure bonding. This establishes a robust method for scalable 3D superconducting quantum computing architectures.

Abstract: Scalable quantum computing currently requires a large array of qubit integration, but present two-dimensional interconnects face challenges such as wiring congestion, electromagnetic interference, and limited cryogenic space. To overcome this challenge, implementing three-dimensional (3D) vertical architectures becomes crucial. Niobium (Nb), due to its excellent superconducting characteristics and strong fabrication process compatibility, stands out as a prime material choice. The main challenge in Nb-Nb bonding is the presence of an oxide layer at the interface, even after post-bonding annealing across various bonding methods. The native Nb oxide forms rapidly in air, creating a resistive barrier to supercurrent flow and introducing two-level system losses that degrade qubit coherence while increasing the overall thermal budget. These issues show the need for effective surface engineering to suppress oxidation during bonding. This study introduces an ultrathin gold (Au) capping layer as a passivation strategy to prevent oxygen incorporation at the Nb surface. This approach enables low-temperature Nb-Nb thermocompression bonding at 350 °C under a reduced bonding pressure of 0.495 MPa. Detailed microstructural and interfacial analyses confirm that Au passivation effectively suppresses oxide formation and hence enhances bonding uniformity and strength with keeping the superconductivity, establishing a robust route toward low-temperature, low-pressure Nb-Nb bonding for scalable 3D superconducting quantum computing architectures.

TL;DR: CDMFT analysis of La_3Ni_2O_7 reveals orbital-selective electronic structure changes and identifies a critical role for double counting corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate the impact of double counting corrections on the correlated electronic structure of La_3Ni_2O_7 under ambient pressure.

Method: Cluster extension of dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) was employed to investigate the impact of double counting corrections on the electronic structure. Double-counting parameters were adjusted while maintaining a fixed Fermi surface.

Result: Pronounced orbital-selective density of states changes were observed, particularly in the d_z^2 orbital, with non-monotonic dependence of interlayer Matsubara self energy on E_dc^z. An optimal double counting window in the d_z^2 orbital aligned with experimental values was identified.

Conclusion: The study establishes E_dc as a critical control parameter for correlated electronic structure in La_3Ni_2O_7 and provides a computational framework for resolving orbital-dependent correlation effects in layered materials.

Abstract: We employ cluster extension of dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) to systematically investigate the impact of double counting corrections on the correlated electronic structure of ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ under ambient pressure. By adjusting double-counting parameters, while maintaining a fixed Fermi surface, we observe a pronounced orbital-selective density of states change: the $d_{z^2}$ orbital undergoes significant variation near the Fermi level with increasing $E_{dc}^z$, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital remains essentially unchanged throughout the entire range. Analysis of renormalization factor show the monotonic dependence with double counting in both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, and it also identifies an optimal double counting window in $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with experimental values. We also find the interlayer Matsubara self energy exhibits non-monotonic dependence on $E_{dc}^z$, deviating from theoretical predictions. This anomaly is attributed to the metallization of oxygen-bridged pathways, which disrupts the prerequisite for charge transfer via apical oxygen. Our results establish $E_{dc}$ as a critical control parameter for correlated electronic structure in ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and provide a computational framework for resolving orbital-dependent correlation effects in layered materials.

TL;DR: The paper explores the coupling between superconductivity and altermagnetism, revealing magnetoelectric effects and proximity-induced magnetization, which compete in vortices and induce transitions in junctions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the coupling between superconductivity and altermagnetism in disordered systems and explore the resulting physical phenomena, including magnetoelectric effects and proximity-induced magnetization.

Method: The research employs quantum kinetic transport equations and quasiclassical theory to derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and analyze the effects in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions.

Result: The study identifies a coupling between spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter, leading to magnetoelectric effects and proximity-induced magnetization. These effects compete in Abrikosov vortices and can cause transitions in Josephson junctions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the interplay between superconductivity and altermagnetism in disordered systems leads to two distinct effects: a magnetoelectric effect and a proximity-induced magnetization. These effects compete in certain scenarios, such as Abrikosov vortices, and can induce transitions in Josephson junctions.

Abstract: We study the interplay between superconductivity and altermagnetism in disordered systems using recently derived quantum kinetic transport equations. Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$π$ transitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the monitored dynamics of many-body quantum systems, focusing on the interplay between projective measurements of extensive operators and unitary evolution.

Method: We develop a general framework to study the thermodynamic limit of mean-field models with all-to-all interactions, where a semiclassical description emerges.

Result: Uncover novel stationary states in the infinite-volume limit, which are distinct from the conventional infinite-temperature state and not linked to the Lindbladian gap closing.

Conclusion: We provide an analytical explanation for the emergence of novel stationary states in the thermodynamic limit, distinct from the conventional infinite-temperature state, despite the lack of connection to the Lindbladian gap closing.

Abstract: We investigate the monitored dynamics of many-body quantum systems in which projective measurements of extensive operators are alternated with unitary evolution. Focusing on mean-field models characterized by all-to-all interactions, we develop a general framework that captures the thermodynamic limit, where a semiclassical description naturally emerges. Remarkably, we uncover novel stationary states, distinct from the conventional infinite-temperature state, that arise upon taking the infinite-volume limit. Counterintuitively, this phenomenon is not linked to the closing of the Lindbladian gap in that limit. We provide analytical explanation for this unexpected behavior.

*Alvaro Navarro-Rubio,Alejandro Lage-Castellanos*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: A unified mean-field framework connects informal and formal financial markets by modeling them as interacting particle systems with a preferential interaction parameter $Ψ$. The approach bridges random and optimal trade dynamics, validated numerically and analytically for some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the dynamics of informal financial markets and formal markets governed by Limit Order Books (LOBs). The authors aim to provide a unified framework that captures the behavior of both systems under a single theoretical lens.

Method: The paper models both informal financial markets and formal markets (LOBs) as interacting particle systems on a 1D price lattice. The dynamics are described by master equations accounting for new entries, cancellations, and executions. A key innovation is the preferential interaction parameter $Ψ$, which modulates transaction likelihood based on price compatibility. A grand-canonical interpretation identifies thermodynamic quantities like interaction energy and chemical potentials.

Result: The framework successfully models both informal and formal markets, with the preferential interaction parameter $Ψ$ acting as a bridge between random interactions ($Ψ=0$) and optimal trades ($Ψ	o \nfty$). Numerical integration and simulations validate most results, and an analytical solution exists for the symmetric stationary case in informal markets.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a unified mean-field framework that connects informal financial markets and formal markets governed by Limit Order Books (LOBs). By modeling both as interacting particle systems and introducing a preferential interaction parameter $Ψ$, the framework successfully bridges the dynamics of these markets. The grand-canonical interpretation further unifies the thermodynamic quantities underlying both systems. Numerical validation and an analytical solution for the symmetric stationary case of informal markets support the findings.

Abstract: We propose a unified mean-field framework that bridges the dynamics of informal financial markets and formal markets governed by Limit Order Books (LOBs). Both settings are modeled as interacting particle systems on a 1D price lattice, with temporal evolution described by master equations that account for new entries, cancellations, and executions. The key insight is the introduction of a preferential interaction parameter $Ψ$, which modulates the likelihood of transactions based on price compatibility: when $Ψ=0$, interactions are random and uncoordinated, reproducing the structure of informal markets; as $Ψ\to \infty$, only optimal (most mutually attractive) trades occur, recovering LOB-like dynamics. A grand-canonical interpretation is used to identify effective thermodynamic quantities -such as interaction energy and price-dependent chemical potentials -that underlie both systems. Most results are validated through numerical integration and simulations, although an analytical solution is shown to exist at least for the symmetric stationary case of the informal market.

TL;DR: The paper offers a detailed tutorial on Persson's contact theory, providing a new stochastic process-based derivation to clarify its complex aspects for researchers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many researchers struggle to understand Persson's theory due to its oversimplified derivation. The paper aims to clarify and provide a more accessible explanation.

Method: The tutorial revisits Persson's theory using stochastic process theory, reassessing the derivation of the diffusion equation, boundary conditions, and coefficients.

Result: A new derivation of Persson's theory is presented, along with a detailed clarification of its assumptions and mathematical foundations.

Conclusion: The paper provides a detailed tutorial on Persson's theory of contact, offering a new derivation based on stochastic process theory and clarifying its assumptions. It serves as a useful introduction for researchers unfamiliar with the theory.

Abstract: Persson's theory of purely normal rough surface contact was developed two decades ago during the study of tire-road interaction, and gradually became one of the dominant approaches to study the solid-solid interaction between rough surfaces. Contrary to its popular applications in various cross-disciplinary fields, the fundamental study of Persson's theory of contact attracted little attention from the tribology and contact mechanics communities. As far as the authors know, many researchers struggle to understand the derivation of the theory. Few attempts have been made to clarify the oversimplified derivation provided by Persson (Persson, 2001). The present work provides a detailed tutorial on Persson's theory, which does not simply follow the commonly adopted derivation initiated by Persson. A new derivation is given based on stochastic process theory, assuming that the variation of the random contact pressure with respect to scale is a Markov process. We revisit the essential assumptions utilized to derive the diffusion equation, boundary conditions, drift and diffusion coefficients, and closed-form results. This tutorial can serve as a self-consistent introduction for solid mechanicians, tribologists, and postgraduate students who are not familiar with Persson's theory, or who struggle to understand it.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effects of dissipation and disorder on the phase diagram of the random quantum Ashkin-Teller model, focusing on its three phases and quantum phase transitions.

Method: The research employs a generalization of the strong-disorder renormalization group combined with adiabatic renormalization.

Result: Two out of the three quantum phase transitions are smeared by the combined effect of Ohmic dissipation and quenched disorder, while one remains sharp due to a cancellation effect.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that while Ohmic dissipation and quenched disorder smear two of the three quantum phase transitions in the random quantum Ashkin-Teller model, one transition remains sharp due to a cancellation effect on the intertwined order parameter.

Abstract: We study the effects of dissipation in the phase diagram of the random quantum Ashkin-Teller model by means of a generalization of the strong-disorder renormalization group combined with adiabatic renormalization. This model has three phases and three quantum phase transitions. We demonstrate that the combined effect of Ohmic dissipation and quenched disorder smears two out of the three quantum phase transitions. Our analytical theory allows us to understand why one of the phase transitions remains sharp. This is due to a cancellation of the dissipation effects on the nontrivial nature of the intertwined order parameter of one of the phases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the controversy over the threshold value σ_* separating SR and LR universality classes in phase transitions, focusing on 2D models with long-range interactions.

Method: Large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D LR-Ising model, analyzing the Fortuin-Kasteleyn critical polynomial R_p, the Binder ratio Q_m, and the anomalous dimension η.

Result: Convergent and self-consistent evidence that the universality class changes sharply at σ=2, consistent with previous results for the XY, Heisenberg, and percolation models.

Conclusion: The universality class for long-range (LR) interacting systems changes sharply at σ=2 across all studied models, establishing σ_*=2 as the unified boundary between LR and short-range (SR) universality classes.

Abstract: Determining the threshold value $σ_*$ that separates the short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) universality classes in phase transitions remains a controversial issue. While Sak's criterion, $σ_* = 2 - η_{\mathrm{SR}}$, has been widely accepted, recent studies of two-dimensional (2D) models with long-range interactions have challenged it. In this work, we focus on the crossover between LR and SR criticality in several classical 2D statistical models, including the XY, Heisenberg, percolation, and Ising models, whose interactions decay as $1/r^{2+σ}$. Our previous simulations for the XY, Heisenberg, and percolation models consistently indicate a universal boundary at $σ_* = 2$. Here, we complete the picture by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D LR-Ising model, reaching lattice sizes up to $L = 8192$. By analyzing the Fortuin-Kasteleyn critical polynomial $R_p$, the Binder ratio $Q_m$, and the anomalous dimension $η$, we obtain convergent and self-consistent evidence that the universality class already changes sharply at $σ= 2$. Taken together, these results establish a unified scenario for LR interacting systems: across all studied models, the crossover from LR to SR universality occurs at $σ_* = 2$.

TL;DR: Study explores transition from weak to strong turbulence in spin waves, revealing new universality and spectral nonlocality effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how inverse turbulent cascades transition from weak to strong turbulence and identify new universality classes in strong turbulence.

Method: Comparison of turbulence in spin waves (ferromagnets), Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NSE), and MMT-like models with multiplicative interaction vertices.

Result: Spin-wave turbulence transitions to strong turbulence far from the pumping scale due to spectral nonlocality. Strong turbulence in multi-component models resembles focusing NSE turbulence and achieves a critical-balance state.

Conclusion: Spin-wave turbulence exhibits unique universality in strong turbulence, with spectral nonlocality enhancing nonlinearity. The level of turbulence at large scales decreases with increased pumping, leading to a state independent of pumping level.

Abstract: Turbulence of weakly interacting waves displays a great deal of universality: independence of the details of the interaction and of the pumping and dissipation scales. Here we study how inverse turbulent cascades (from small to large scales) transition from weak to strong. We find that while one-loop corrections can be dependent on excitation and dissipation scales, new types of universality appear in strong turbulence. We contrast turbulence of spin waves in ferromagnets with turbulent cascades in the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NSE) and in an MMT-like model in higher dimensions having a multiplicative interaction vertex: vertex renormalization gives rise to dependence on the pumping (UV scale) in the former but not in the latter. As a result of this spectral nonlocality, spin-wave turbulence stops being weak if one is sufficiently far from the pumping scale, even when the interaction of waves with comparable wavenumbers is weak. We paraphrase this as: nonlocality enhances nonlinearity.
  We then describe strong turbulence in a multi-component version of these models with a large number of components. We argue that strong spin-wave turbulence is similar to turbulence of the focusing NSE, as it realizes a critical-balance state. However, UV nonlocality causes the level of spin-wave turbulence at large scales to decrease with increasing pumping level, culminating in a state that is independent of the level of pumping.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种化学模型，通过传感器耦合信号通路主动平衡信息获取与能量消耗，为生物和生化适应提供了可行的设计原则。

Abstract: Biological systems sense and extract information from fluctuating signals while operating under energetic constraints and limited resolution. We introduce a general chemical model in which a sensor, coupled to a signaling pathway activated by hidden signals, can allosterically tune the production of a readout molecule. We propose viable strategies for the sensor to estimate, and eventually balance, information gathering on the hidden process and the associated dissipative cost relying solely on counting statistics of observed trajectories. We show that these strategies can be successfully implemented to adapt the readout production even with finite-time measurements and limited dynamic resolution, and remain effective in the presence of inhibitory regulatory mechanisms. Our study provides a plausible mechanism to actively balance information and dissipation, paving the way for an implementable design principle underpinning biological and biochemical adaptation.

Result: The model exhibits an exponentially large manifold of non-equilibrium steady states, exceptional rings in momentum space, and a PT symmetry breaking transition driven by dissipation strength.

Conclusion: The paper establishes an exactly solvable model for studying dissipative spin liquid physics and Liouvillian spectral singularities, providing insights into relaxation dynamics in open quantum systems.

Abstract: Exactly solvable dissipative models provide an analytical tool for studying the relaxation dynamics in open quantum systems. In this work, we study an exactly solvable model based on an anisotropic variant of the Yao-Lee spin-orbital model, with dissipation acting in the spin sector. We map Liouvillian dynamics to fermions hopping in a doubled Hilbert space under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and demonstrate the model's exact solvability. We analyze the model's strong and weak symmetries, which protect an exponentially large manifold of non-equilibrium steady states, establishing the system as a physically feasible dissipative spin liquid. Furthermore, we analyze the transient dynamics in a translationally invariant sector and discover that the single-particle Liouvillian spectrum hosts an exceptional ring in momentum space. We map out a characteristic $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking transition driven by the dissipation strength, which governs the crossover from oscillatory to decaying relaxation of physical observables. Our work provides a physically motivated, solvable setting for exploring the coexistence of dissipative spin liquid physics and Liouvillian spectral singularities.

Motivation: To optimize lattice surgery compilation by moving beyond the static placement of logical qubits, addressing limitations in conventional place-and-route schemes.

Method: Introduces a paradigm shift in lattice surgery compilation by utilizing teleportation for movable logical qubits during CNOT gates, focusing on the color code.

Result: Numerical simulations confirm substantial reductions in routed circuit depth compared to standard techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed compilation scheme with movable logical qubits via teleportation significantly reduces routed circuit depth, demonstrating applicability to superconducting quantum hardware.

Abstract: Lattice surgery with two-dimensional quantum error correcting codes is among the leading schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computation, motivated by superconducting hardware architectures. In conventional lattice surgery compilation schemes, logical circuits are compiled following a place-and-route paradigm, where logical qubits remain statically fixed in space throughout the computation. In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by exploiting movable logical qubits via teleportation during the logical lattice surgery CNOT gate. Focusing on lattice surgery with the color code, we propose a proof-of-concept compilation scheme that leverages this capability. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach can substantially reduce the routed circuit depth compared to standard place-and-route compilation techniques. Our results demonstrate that optimizations based on movable logical qubits are not limited to architectures with physically movable qubits, such as neutral atoms or trapped ions - they are also readily applicable to superconducting quantum hardware. An open-source implementation of our method is available on GitHub https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qecc.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the high costs associated with code switching in fault-tolerant quantum computing, including time and space overhead and increased logical error rates, by minimizing the number of switches required.

Method: The approach involves reducing the problem of minimizing code switches to a minimum-cut instance on a graph derived from the quantum circuit, allowing for additional considerations like reducing depth overhead or favoring one code over another.

Result: The study demonstrates that the problem of minimizing code switches can be solved efficiently in polynomial time using a graph-based approach, offering flexibility for incorporating additional optimization goals.

Conclusion: The study presents an efficient polynomial-time solution to minimize code switches in quantum circuits by reducing the problem to a minimum-cut instance on a graph derived from the circuit.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computers rely on Quantum Error-Correcting Codes (QECCs) to protect information from noise. However, no single error-correcting code supports a fully transversal and therefore fault-tolerant implementation of all gates required for universal quantum computation. Code switching addresses this limitation by moving quantum information between different codes that, together, support a universal gate set. Unfortunately, each switch is costly-adding time and space overhead and increasing the logical error rate. Minimizing the number of switching operations is, therefore, essential for quantum computations using code switching. In this work, we study the problem of minimizing the number of code switches required to run a given quantum circuit. We show that this problem can be solved efficiently in polynomial time by reducing it to a minimum-cut instance on a graph derived from the circuit. Our formulation is flexible and can incorporate additional considerations, such as reducing depth overhead by preferring switches during idle periods or biasing the compilation to favor one code over another. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automated approach for compiling and optimizing code-switching-based quantum computations at the logical level.

Abstract: We present a universal quantum computing architecture which combines the measurement-driven aspect of MBQC with the circuit model's algorithm dependent generation of qubit entanglement. Our architecture, which we call QGATE, is tailored for discrete-variable photonic quantum computers with deterministic photon sources capable of generating 1D entangled photonic states. QGATE achieves universal quantum computing on a logical data qubit register via the implementation of Clifford operations, QGATE ancilla, and arbitrary angle single-qubit measurements. We realise unitary evolutions defined by multi-qubit Pauli strings via the generation of entanglement between a sub-set of logical qubits and a mutual QGATE ancilla qubit. Measurement of the QGATE ancilla in the appropriate basis then implements a given term of the desired unitary operation. This enables QGATE to both directly perform Hamiltonian evolutions in terms of a series of multi-qubit Pauli operators, in terms of projectors for an arbitrary sparse Hamiltonian, or realise multi-controlled gates enabling direct translation of circuit models to QGATE. We consider examples inspired by quantum chemistry and computational fluid dynamics. We propose an example photonic implementation of QGATE and calculate thresholds of $10.36\pm0.02\%$ or $25.98\pm0.28\%$ on the photonic loss for logical qubits constructed from foliated rotated surface codes, dependent on the deployment of intra-layer or inter-layer fusion respectively.

*Yìlè Yīng,David Schmid,Robert W. Spekkens*

TL;DR: Quantum advantage in conclusive exclusion demonstrated via noise-robust inequalities and experimental validation, extending to a bilocality scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and quantify the quantum-over-classical advantage in the task of conclusive exclusion, leveraging noncontextuality inequalities and experimental validation.

Method: The authors use a generalized-noncontextual ontological model to define classicality and derive noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities. An experimental scenario inspired by the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem is employed to validate the quantum advantage.

Result: The research shows a quantum violation of the derived noncontextuality inequalities and establishes a novel possibilistic proof of a quantum-classical gap in the bilocality scenario.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a quantum advantage in the task of conclusive exclusion, with experimental and theoretical evidence supporting the violation of noncontextuality inequalities. This also extends to a classical causal compatibility inequality in the bilocality scenario, revealing a quantum-classical gap.

Abstract: The task of conclusive exclusion for a set of quantum states is to find a measurement such that for each state in the set, there is an outcome that allows one to conclude with certainty that the state in question was not prepared. Defining classicality of statistics as realizability by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model, we show that there is a quantum-over-classical advantage for how well one can achieve conclusive exclusion. This is achieved in an experimental scenario motivated by the construction appearing in the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem. We derive noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities bounding the conclusiveness of exclusion, and describe a quantum violation of these. Finally, we show that this bound also constitutes a classical causal compatibility inequality within the bilocality scenario, and that its violation in quantum theory yields a novel possibilistic proof of a quantum-classical gap in that scenario.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: VQE with a tailored ansatz circuit identifies infinite order phase transitions by analyzing ground state energy errors, validated by exact diagonalization and improved via deeper circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying phase transition boundaries for infinite order phase transitions, which lack analytical solutions and are classically difficult to compute, using VQE as a practical quantum computational tool.

Method: Utilizing VQE with a custom ansatz circuit designed to maintain constant net spin, the study evaluates ground state energy sensitivity across phases. The phase boundaries are identified by observing errors in energy calculations. Exact diagonalization is used for validation.

Result: The proposed ansatz circuit successfully distinguishes phases by varying ground state energy errors, enabling accurate determination of phase boundaries. Exact diagonalization corroborates the findings, and deeper optimization circuits enhance ground energy precision for J = -1.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that VQE can effectively identify phase transition boundaries for infinite order phase transitions by analyzing ground state energy errors. The comparison with exact diagonalization validates the method, while increasing the circuit depth improves ground energy accuracy for the LRXXZ chain (J = -1).

Abstract: The variational quantum eigen solver (VQE), has been widely used to find the ground state energy of different Hamiltonians with no analytical solutions and are classically difficult to compute. In our work, we have used VQE to identify the phase transition boundary for an infinite order phase transition. We use long-range XXZ (LRXXZ) chain for our study. In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process. Consequently, the ansatz works in a certain phase where it gives relatively small random error, as it should, when compared to the error in ground state energy calculations of the other phases, where the ansatz fails. By identifying these changes in the behaviour of the error in ground state energy using VQE, we were able to determine the phase boundaries. Using exact diagonalisation, we also compare the behaviour of the energy gradient and energy gap across both the phase transition boundaries for this model. Further, by increasing the depth of the optimisation circuit, we also accurately evaluate the ground energy of the LRXXZ chain for the value of coupling constant, J equal to -1

Conclusion: The paper presents an open-source, extensible framework for simulating heterogeneous quantum networks, identifying key bottlenecks and trade-offs, supporting future research and protocol development.

Abstract: Quantum networks are expected to be heterogeneous systems, combining distinct qubit platforms, photon wavelengths, and device timescales to achieve scalable, multiuser connectivity. Building and iterating on such systems is costly and slow, motivating hardware-faithful simulations to explore architecture design space and justify implementation decisions. This paper presents a framework for simulating heterogeneous quantum networks based on SeQUeNCe, a discrete-event simulator of quantum networks. We introduce faithful device models for two representative platforms - Ytterbium atoms and superconducting qubits. On top of these models, we implement entanglement generation and entanglement swapping protocols for time-bin encoded photons that account for disparate clock rates and quantum frequency conversion and transducer losses/noise brought by the heterogeneity. Using extensive simulations, we map the rate-fidelity trade space and identify the dominant bottlenecks unique to heterogeneous systems. The models are open source and extensible, enabling reproducible evaluation of future heterogeneous designs and protocols.

TL;DR: A new method for probing chirality in bulk wavefunctions using multipartite entanglement measures and permutation defects, validated numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe chirality directly from the bulk wavefunction, as the manifestation of edge anomaly within the bulk ground-state wavefunction remains partially understood.

Method: Introducing a family of multipartite entanglement measures involving permutation defects at boundaries, and developing a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically.

Result: The method correctly identifies the chiral contribution as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces, verified numerically with free-fermion and strongly-interacting chiral topological states.

Conclusion: The results enable the extraction of chiral central charge and Hall conductance using a finite number of wavefunction replicas, making them accessible to numerical techniques and quantum devices.

Abstract: The hallmark of two-dimensional chiral topological phases is the existence of anomalous gapless modes at the spatial boundary. Yet, the manifestation of this edge anomaly within the bulk ground-state wavefunction itself remains only partially understood. In this work, we introduce a family of multipartite entanglement measures that probe chirality directly from the bulk wavefunction. Our construction involves applying different permutations between replicas of the ground state wavefunction in neighboring spatial regions, creating "permutation defects" at the boundaries between these regions. We provide general arguments for the robustness of these measures and develop a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically. While the standard topological field theory prescription misses the chiral contribution, our method correctly identifies it as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces. This feature is a consequence of the bulk-edge correspondence, which dictates that any regularization of the theory at the permutation defects must introduce gapless boundary modes. We numerically verify our results with both free-fermion and strongly-interacting chiral topological states and find excellent agreement. Our results enable the extraction of the chiral central charge and the Hall conductance using a finite number of wavefunction replicas, making these quantities accessible to Monte-Carlo numerical techniques and noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

TL;DR: The paper explores coherence enhancement in quantum states using non-increasing operations, solving the qubit case and developing a protocol revealing unbounded coherence amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether it is possible to enhance the coherence of a quantum state given low-coherence inputs using coherence non-increasing operations, addressing both practical and foundational questions in quantum physics.

Method: The study focuses on the minimal limiting case of two uncorrelated copies of a coherent state, analyzing the possibility of increasing subsystem coherence via globally coherence non-increasing unitaries. Optimal unitaries are identified, and a multi-qubit coherence enhancement protocol is constructed.

Result: The study fully solves the problem for qubits, identifying optimal unitaries and bound coherence. It also presents a multi-qubit protocol demonstrating unbounded coherence amplification under specific conditions and establishes fundamental upper bounds on local coherence increase.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with the identification of bound coherence in qubits and the development of a constructive protocol for multi-qubit coherence enhancement, revealing the potential for unbounded coherence amplification under certain conditions.

Abstract: Unspeakable coherence is a key feature separating quantum and classical physics. Modelled as asymmetry with respect to a continuous transformation generated by a physically relevant observable, such as the Hamiltonian or angular moment, unspeakable coherence has been shown to be the relevant notion of coherence for achieving quantum advantage in the tasks of metrology, reference frame alignment and work extraction, among others. A question of both practical and foundational value is: Given some copies of a state with low coherence, can we prepare a more coherent state via coherence non-increasing operations? Here, we study this question in the minimal limiting case: Given two uncorrelated copies of a coherent state, can one, via globally coherence non-increasing unitaries, increase the coherence in a subsystem? We fully solve this problem for qubits, identifying the optimal unitaries and revealing the existence of bound coherence. This is then used to create a completely constructive multi-qubit coherence enhancement protocol, where only effective-qubit unitaries are used. Unexpectedly, in this protocol, we show that there exists states for which the ratio of the input-output coherence can be amplified unboundedly. Extending beyond qubits, we derive two fundamental upper bounds on the amount of local coherence that can be increased and prove a no-go theorem showing that certain global correlations cannot be converted to local coherence.

TL;DR: The paper examines false vacuum decay in a Rydberg atom ring, confirming QFT predictions and revealing deviations from universal scaling laws due to metastability, while introducing resonant bubble nucleation as a novel feature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the physics of false vacuum decay and bubble nucleation in quantum field theory using a controllable quantum system, specifically a Rydberg atom ring, which allows for observations beyond classical models.

Method: The study investigates false vacuum decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring, leveraging long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability to go beyond the standard Ising model.

Result: The false vacuum decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, aligning with QFT predictions. Additionally, minor deviations from the ideal metastable state disrupt the universal scaling law, and resonant bubble nucleation is observed, unique to systems with discrete energy spectra.

Conclusion: The study's findings and methods pave the way for future research on many-body tunneling in higher dimensions or more complex geometries, demonstrating the versatility of Rydberg atom rings in exploring QFT phenomena.

Abstract: In quantum field theory (QFT), the "vacuum" is not just empty space but the lowest-energy state of a quantum field. If the energy landscape has multiple local minima, the local ground states are the false vacuum (FV) which can tunnel towards the global ground state (true vacuum, TV). This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra. Our findings and methods open avenues for future studies of many-body tunneling in higher dimensions or more complex geometries.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of group velocity dispersion (GVD) as a tool for quantum light manipulation, while also identifying the limitations of the perturbative approach in multimode systems.

Abstract: Temporal modes of quantum light pulses is a promising resource for modern quantum technologies, driving advancements in quantum computing, communication, and metrology. Precise control and manipulation of these modes remain critical challenges, particularly in systems where nonlinear multimode dynamics interact with dispersion effects. In this work, we focus on the role of group velocity dispersion (GVD) within optical cavities - a phenomenon traditionally viewed as detrimental but increasingly recognized as a versatile tool for quantum light manipulation. We present a perturbation-theory-based approach to analyze GVD effects in a synchronously pumped dispersive cavity. By comparing perturbative solutions to rigorous steady-state results, we establish the validity region of the perturbative approach and assess its limitations in multimode systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify deviations from the instantaneous nonequilibrium steady state and understand the universality of irreversible dissipation induced by driving open quantum systems near criticality.

Method: Analysis of finite-time driving across second-order dissipative quantum phase transitions using Lindblad dynamics, validated in the driven-dissipative Dicke model and open Kerr model.

Result: The nonadiabatic entropy production exhibits universal power-law scaling, and in bosonic Gaussian systems, it is independent of driving speed to leading order.

Conclusion: The study establishes a general framework for understanding universal nonequilibrium response and thermodynamic irreversibility in critical open quantum systems.

Abstract: We study finite-time driving across second-order dissipative quantum phase transitions described by Lindblad dynamics. We show that the nonadiabatic entropy production, which quantifies deviations from the instantaneous nonequilibrium steady state, exhibits universal power-law scaling with the ramp duration in analogy to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for closed systems. This establishes the universality of irreversible dissipation induced by driving an open quantum system near criticality. Furthermore, in systems described by bosonic Gaussian states, our scaling laws predict that the nonadiabatic entropy production is independent of driving speed to leading order, revealing a distinctive feature of Gaussian dissipative quantum phase transitions. We validate these analytical predictions in the thermodynamic limit of the driven-dissipative Dicke model and via finite-size scaling in the open Kerr model. Our results establish a general framework for understanding universal nonequilibrium response and thermodynamic irreversibility in critical open quantum systems.

Result: Significant amplification of the EIT transparency window with the GRIN lens, leading to reduced minimum detectable electric field and increased SNR.

Conclusion: The integration of a GRIN metamaterial lens with an atom-based Rydberg RF receiver significantly enhances sensitivity, validating the potential of metamaterial-assisted quantum sensing for overcoming bandwidth and sensitivity limitations in applications like EMC testing, quantum radar, and wireless communications.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate enhanced sensitivity of an atom-based Rydberg radio frequency (RF) receiver integrated with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) Luneburg-type metamaterial lens. By analyzing the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in Cesium vapor, we compare receiver performance with and without the GRIN lens under a 2.2~GHz and a 3.6~GHz far-field excitation. Our measurements reveal a significant amplification of the EIT transparency window when the lens is introduced, consistent with the theoretical prediction that the local E-field enhancement at the vapor cell reduces the minimum detectable electric field and increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the Rydberg RF receiver. This experimental validation highlights the potential of metamaterial-assisted quantum sensing to overcome the inherent bandwidth and sensitivity limitations of bare Rydberg receivers for a variety of applications, such as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, quantum radar, and wireless communications.

In this short note, we find a converse implication, demonstrating that the operator layer cake theorem is equivalent to Frenkel's integral formula.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Adversaries can evade QKD detection with minimal classical admixture. Prior certification methods inflated detection performance by 44%, revealing potential overestimated security claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the discrepancy between theoretical security proofs of QKD (assuming idealized conditions) and practical challenges posed by adaptive adversaries.

Method: Utilized Eve GAN (generative adversarial network) to simulate classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum. Analyzed detection methods under varying mixing parameters and distribution calibration practices.

Result: Eve-GAN demonstrated that a 5% classical admixture allows eavesdroppers to evade detection, achieving ROC AUC = 0.50 (random guessing). A phase transition was identified at CHSH S = 2.05, marking the threshold for distinguishing classical from quantum correlations.

Conclusion: Quantum key distribution (QKD) security claims may be overestimated due to systematic flaws in prior certification studies. Adversarial testing and cross-distribution calibration are recommended for accurate security evaluation.

Abstract: Security of quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on certifying that observed correlations arise from genuine quantum entanglement rather than eavesdropper manipulation. Theoretical security proofs assume idealized conditions, practical certification must contend with adaptive adversaries who optimize their attack strategies against detection systems. Established fundamental adversarial limits for quantum certification using Eve GAN, a generative adversarial network trained to produce classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum. Our central finding: when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This means an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. Critically, we discover that same distribution calibration a common practice in prior certification studies inflates detection performance by 44 percentage points compared to proper cross distribution evaluation, revealing a systematic flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims. Analysis of Popescu Rohrlich (PR Box) regime identifies a sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05: below this value, no statistical method distinguishes classical from quantum correlations; above it, detection probability increases monotonically. Hardware validation on IBM Quantum demonstrates that Eve-GAN achieves CHSH = 2.736, remarkably exceeding real quantum hardware performance (CHSH = 2.691), illustrating that classical adversaries can outperform noisy quantum systems on standard certification metrics. These results have immediate implications for QKD security: adversaries maintaining 95% quantum fidelity evade all tested detection methods. We provide corrected methodology using cross-distribution calibration and recommend mandatory adversarial testing for quantum security claims.

Abstract: This study explores the use of subspace methods in combination with counterdiabatic driving in a Rydberg atom system to solve the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Although exact counterdiabatic driving offers excellent performance, it comes at an unscalable computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate that counterdiabatic driving can be significantly improved by restricting the analysis to a relevant subspace of the system. We first show that both direct diagonalization and the Krylov method for obtaining the counterdiabatic matrix can be accelerated through the use of subspace techniques, while still maintaining strong performance. We then demonstrate that the cost function used in the standard Krylov method can be further optimized by employing a subspace-based cost function. These findings open up new possibilities for applying counterdiabatic driving in a practical and efficient manner to a variety of quantum systems.

Abstract: Although the control of non-Hermitian quantum systems has a growing interest for their nonunitary feature in the time evolution, the existing discussions are not more than two or three dimensions and heavily influenced by the singularity of the energy spectrum. We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes governed by the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It takes advantage of the gauge potential in the instantaneous frame rather than the energy spectrum of Hamiltonian. In particular, the dynamics of a general non-Hermitian continuous-variable system is analyzed in the instantaneous frame associated with time-dependent ancillary operators that are superpositions of the laboratory-frame operators and irrelevant to the original Hamiltonian. The gauge potential is determined by the unitary transformation between the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. The upper triangularization condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame enables two of the time-dependent ancillary operators to be nonadiabatic Heisenberg passages of the non-Hermitian system. The probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be restored at the end of these passages without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to the parity-time symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the exceptional point of the spectra; and the latter is consistent with the unidirectional perfect absorbtion. Our work essentially extends the universal quantum control (UQC) theory to the non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems, providing a promising approach for their coherent control.

Abstract: The emergence of huge-scale, data-intensive linear optimization (LO) problems in applications such as machine learning has driven the need for more computationally efficient interior point methods (IPMs). While conventional IPMs are polynomial-time algorithms with rapid convergence, their per-iteration cost can be prohibitively high for dense large-scale LO problems. Quantum linear system solvers have shown potential in accelerating the solution of linear systems arising in IPMs. In this work, we introduce a novel almost-exact quantum IPM, where the Newton system is constructed and solved on a quantum computer, while solution updates occur on a classical machine. Additionally, all matrix-vector products are performed on the quantum hardware. This hybrid quantum-classical framework achieves an optimal worst-case scaling of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ for fully dense LO problems. To ensure high precision, despite the limited accuracy of quantum operations, we incorporate iterative refinement techniques both within and outside the proposed IPM iterations. The proposed algorithm has a quantum complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.5} κ_A \log(\frac{1}ε))$ queries to QRAM and $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log(\frac{1}ε))$ classical arithmetic operations. Our method outperforms the worst-case complexity of prior classical and quantum IPMs, offering a significant improvement in scalability and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: A scalable framework for classifying MUBs subsets, avoiding precision issues and providing exact classifications for dimensions up to 17.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the open problem of classifying high-dimensional mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) subsets, overcoming limitations of existing methods such as computational resource constraints and numerical precision issues.

Method: An operational approach to identify the inequivalence of MUBs subsets, with reduced time complexity and avoidance of computational precision issues. It provides universal analytical upper bounds for equivalence classes and iteratively refines these bounds.

Result: Universal analytical upper bounds for MUBs equivalence classes in prime dimensions; exact classification for d ≤ 17; extension to prime power dimensions.

Conclusion: The method introduced provides a scalable and general framework for classifying MUBs subsets, determining exact classifications for dimensions d ≤ 17 and extending applicability to prime power dimensions.

Abstract: The structural characterization of high-dimensional mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) by classifying MUBs subsets remains a major open problem. The existing methods not only fail to conclude on the exact classification, but also are severely limited by computational resources and suffer from the numerical precision problem. Here we introduce an operational approach to identify the inequivalence of MUBs subsets, which has less time complexity and entirely avoids the computational precision issues. For arbitrary MUBs subsets of $k$ elements in any prime dimension, this method yields a universal analytical upper bound for the amount of MUBs equivalence classes. By applying this method through simple iterations, we further obtain tighter classification upper bounds for any prime dimension $d\leq 37$. Crucially, the comparison of these upper bounds with existing lower bounds successfully determines the exact classification for all MUBs subsets in any dimension $d \leq 17$. We further extend this method to the case that the dimension is a power of prime number. This general and scalable framework for the classification of MUBs subsets sheds new light on related applications.

TL;DR: A qudit-native framework for stable DTCs is introduced, using subspace confinement and normal-form analysis, demonstrating enhanced stability across various qudit platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to engineer robust discrete time crystals (DTCs) by using qudit-native frameworks, addressing the challenge of suppressing heating and enhancing stability in quantum systems.

Method: The approach leverages the internal multilevel structure of qudits to confine the periodic drive to specified on-site subspaces, creating an embedded kick that suppresses heating. A normal-form analysis decomposes the effective dynamics into distinct components.

Result: In spin-1 chains, stability of DTC is enhanced by confining the drive to a subspace; in spin-3/2 systems, robustness is dictated by subspace symmetry; in spin-2 platforms, concurrent 2T and 3T DTCs are realized under a unified drive.

Conclusion: The study establishes a systematic, hardware-efficient methodology for designing stable and multifunctional Floquet phases of matter on modern qudit-based quantum processors.

Abstract: We introduce a qudit-native framework for engineering robust discrete time crystals (DTCs) by leveraging their internal multilevel structure. Our approach confines the periodic drive to specified on-site subspaces, creating an embedded kick that suppresses heating by preventing population leakage to inactive levels. We underpin DTC stability with a normal-form analysis that decomposes the effective dynamics into distinct components: the carrier locks the subharmonic frequency, neutral terms govern the slow decay and dephasing of the subharmonic response, and charged terms scatter spectral weight away from the locked modes. This framework's predictive power is demonstrated across various qudit platforms: in spin-1 chains, we enhance the stability of DTC by confining the drive to a subspace; in spin-3/2 systems, we show that robustness is dictated by the symmetry of the subspace partition; and in spin-2 platforms, we realize concurrent 2T and 3T DTCs under a unified drive. These findings establish a systematic, hardware-efficient methodology for designing stable and multifunctional Floquet phases of matter on modern qudit-based quantum processors.

Abstract: Accurate computation of non-covalent, intermolecular interaction energies is important to understand various chemical phenomena, and quantum computers are anticipated to accelerate it. Although the state-of-the-art quantum computers are still noisy and intermediate-scale ones, development of theoretical frameworks those are expected to work on a fault-tolerant quantum computer is an urgent issue. In this work, we explore resource-efficient implementation of the quantum phase estimation-based complete active space configuration interaction (QPE-CASCI) calculations, with the aid of the second-order Møller--Plesset perturbation theory (MP2)-based active space selection with Boys localized orbitals. We performed numerical simulations of QPE for the supramolecular approach-based intermolecular interaction energy calculations of the hydrogen-bonded water dimer, using 6 system and 6 ancilla qubits. With the aid of algorithmic error mitigation, the QPE-CASCI simulations achieved interaction energy predictions with an error of 0.02 kcal mol$^{-1}$ relative to the CASCI result, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology. Preliminary results on quantum circuit compression for QPE are also presented to reduce the number of two-qubit gates and depth.

Abstract: Recently proposed metastability-induced quantum batteries have shown particular promise for coherent microwave generation. However, achieving high-power coherent microwave generation in quantum batteries remains fundamentally challenging due to quantum correlations, aging, and self-discharging processes. For the cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED)-based quantum batteries, a further trade-off arises between strong spin-photon coupling for energy storage and sufficient output coupling for power delivery. To overcome these constraints, we introduce dissipation engineering as a dynamic control strategy that temporally separates energy storage and release. By suppressing emission during charging and rapidly enhancing the output coupling during discharging, we realize nanosecond microwave bursts with watt-level peak power. By optimizing three dissipation schemes, we improve work extraction efficiency of the quantum battery by over two orders of magnitude and achieve high power compression factors outperforming the state-of-the-art techniques, establishing dissipation engineering as a pathway toward room-temperature, high-power coherent microwave sources.

Motivation: To address combinatorial optimization problems with integer-valued variables more efficiently by leveraging qudit encoding and imaginary-time evolution.

Method: A classical quantum-inspired strategy using qudits to encode decision variables, with gradient-based adaptive selection of Hermitian operators for state evolution.

Result: Reduced number of decision variables compared to binary formulations and improved convergence properties through adaptive operator selection.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm demonstrates promising results on the Min-d-Cut problem with constraints, outperforming Gurobi on penalized constraint formulation, especially for larger values of d.

Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution has been shown to be a promising framework for tackling combinatorial optimization problems on quantum hardware. In this work, we propose a classical quantum-inspired strategy for solving combinatorial optimization problems with integer-valued decision variables by encoding decision variables into multi-level quantum states known as qudits. This method results in a reduced number of decision variables compared to binary formulations while inherently incorporating single-association constraints. Efficient classical simulation is enabled by constraining the system to remain in a product state throughout optimization. The qudit states are optimized by applying a sequence of unitary operators that iteratively approximate the dynamics of imaginary time evolution. Unlike previous studies, we propose a gradient-based method of adaptively choosing the Hermitian operators used to generate the state evolution at each optimization step, as a means to improve the convergence properties of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm demonstrates promising results on Min-d-Cut problem with constraints, outperforming Gurobi on penalized constraint formulation, particularly for larger values of d.

Our simulations performed on IBM Brisbane produced energies well within chemical accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing single- and two-qubit control errors caused by residual exchange coupling in exchange-coupled resonant singlet-triplet qubit systems.

Method: Proposed methods include commensurate driving and the use of a single-spin coupler to mitigate control errors and crosstalk.

Result: Coupler-assisted two-qubit gate errors can be below 3 × 10⁻³ for gate times as short as 66 ns, reducing crosstalk by an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: The study suggests that coupler-based architectures have potential for large-scale fault-tolerant spin qubit processors using resonant singlet-triplet qubits.

Abstract: We propose methods to mitigate single- and two-qubit control errors due to residual exchange coupling in systems of exchange-coupled resonant singlet-triplet qubits. Commensurate driving, where the pulse length is an integer multiple of the drive period, can mitigate errors from residual intra-qubit exchange, including effects from counter rotating terms and off-axis rotations, as well as leakage errors during two-qubit operations. Residual inter-qubit exchange creates crosstalk errors that reduce single-qubit control fidelities. We show that using a single-spin coupler between two resonant singlet-triplet qubits can reduce this crosstalk error by an order of magnitude. Assuming perfect coupler state preparation and realistic charge and hyperfine noise, we predict that coupler-assisted two-qubit gate errors can be below $3\times10^{-3}$ for gate times as short as $66~\text{ns}$, even in the presence of residual exchange levels exceeding several hundred kHz. Our results suggest the potential of utilizing coupler-based architectures for large scale fault-tolerant spin qubit processors based on resonant singlet-triplet qubits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether the precision advantage of SE over joint estimation (JE) in 'sloppy' models, as predicted by asymptotic analysis, holds within a practical Bayesian framework with limited resources.

Method: The work investigates Bayesian stepwise estimation (SE) for measuring the two parameters of a unitary qubit rotation, using polarisation qubits in an experimental implementation.

Result: Uncertainties close to the classical Van Trees bounds were achieved experimentally, but the asymptotic SE advantage was mitigated in practice due to averaging over prior distributions.

Conclusion: Comparing the total error to the ultimate quantum Van Trees bound for joint estimation (JE) reveals that averaging over prior distributions erases the asymptotic stepwise estimation (SE) advantage. However, SE retains a significant practical benefit due to its simplicity and reliance on fixed measurements.

Abstract: This work investigates Bayesian stepwise estimation (Se) for measuring the two parameters of a unitary qubit rotation. While asymptotic analysis predicts a precision advantage for SE over joint estimation (JE) in regimes where the quantum Fisher information matrix is near-singular ("sloppy" models), we demonstrate that this advantage is mitigated within a practical Bayesian framework with limited resources. We experimentally implement a SE protocol using polarisation qubits, achieving uncertainties close to the classical Van Trees bounds. However, comparing the total error to the ultimate quantum Van Trees bound for JE reveals that averaging over prior distributions erases the asymptotic SE advantage. Nevertheless, the stepwise strategy retains a significant practical benefit as it operates effectively with simple, fixed measurements, whereas saturating the JE bound typically requires complex, parameter-dependent operations.

Abstract: Transmitting information about quantum states over classical noisy channels is an important problem with applications to science, computing, and sensing. This task, however, poses fundamental challenges due to the exponential scaling of state space with system size. We introduce shadow tomography-based transmission with unequal error protection (STT-UEP), a novel communication protocol that enables efficient transmission of properties of quantum states, allowing decoder-side estimation of arbitrary observables. Unlike conventional approaches requiring the transmission of a number of bits that is exponential in the number of qubits, STT-UEP achieves communication complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of observables, depending on the observable weight. The protocol exploits classical shadow tomography for measurement efficiency, and applies unequal error protection by encoding measurement bases with stronger channel codes than measurement outcomes. We provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy as a function of the bit error probability of the classical channel, and validate the approach against several benchmarks via numerical results.

Result: Enabling all-to-all connectivity, higher expansion order, and a non-Hartree-Fock basis significantly improves convergence. Additionally, noise on a real quantum device (Quantinuum H2) unexpectedly enhances energy convergence.

Conclusion: The study shows that optimizing parameters like connectivity, expansion order, and molecular orbital basis can significantly improve the convergence of the SQD algorithm, despite tradeoffs related to hardware capabilities.

Abstract: Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is an algorithm for hybrid quantum-classical molecular simulation that has been of broad interest for application with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, SQD does not always converge on a practical timescale. Here, we explore scaling of the algorithm for a variable-length molecule made up of 2 to 6 copper oxide plaquettes with a minimal molecular orbital basis. The results demonstrate that enabling all-to-all connectivity, instituting a higher expansion order for the SQD algorithm, and adopting a non-Hartree-Fock molecular orbital basis can all play significant roles in overcoming sampling bottlenecks, though with tradeoffs that need to be weighed against the capabilities of quantum and classical hardware. Additionally, we find that noise on a real quantum computer, the Quantinuum H2 trapped ion device, can improve energy convergence beyond expectations based on noise-free statevector simulations.

Result: The paper illustrates the application of these control principles in controlling atoms and superconducting qubits, showing the effectiveness of the methods.

Conclusion: The chapter concludes with an outlook on integrating coherent control with engineered dissipation and a discussion of open questions in the field.

Abstract: Quantum control refers to our ability to manipulate quantum systems. This tutorial-style chapter focuses on the use of classical electromagnetic fields to steer the system dynamics. In this approach, the quantum nature of the control stems solely from the underlying dynamics, through the exploitation of destructive and constructive interference to reach the control target. We first discuss two basic control principles -- coherent control which uses manipulation in frequency or time to design these interferences, and adiabatic following where access to the control target is enabled by tracking the time-dependent ground state. For complex control targets and system dynamics that exceed the scope of these basic principles, optimal control theory provides a powerful suite of tools to design the necessary protocols. A key consideration for the successful application of optimal control theory is a proper choice of the optimization functional. All concepts are illustrated using recent work from my research group, with a focus on controlling atoms and superconducting qubits. The chapter concludes with an outlook on integrating coherent control with engineered dissipation and a discussion of open questions in the field.

Result: Achieved iSWAP gate protocols with fidelities exceeding 99.9% under realistic experimental conditions, considering noise sources like atomic motion and laser phase noise.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the feasibility of achieving high-fidelity iSWAP and parameterized exchange gates in neutral atom quantum processing units, expanding the gate set beyond Rydberg blockade-based methods.

Abstract: We present a native realization of iSWAP and parameterized exchange gates for neutral atom quantum processing units. Our approach leverages strong dipole-dipole interactions between two dipole-coupled Rydberg states, and employs optimal control techniques to design time-efficient, high-fidelity gate protocols. To minimize experimental complexity, we utilize global driving terms acting identically on all atoms. We implement a noise-aware pulse selection strategy to identify candidate protocols with reduced susceptibility to certain noise sources, then analyze their performance under realistic noise sources -- including atomic motion, Rydberg decay, and experimentally motivated laser phase and intensity noise. For a $^{88}$Sr-based architecture, we demonstrate fast iSWAP gate protocols which exceed fidelities of $99.9\%$ under realistic experimental conditions. These results pave the way for expanding the neutral atom gate set beyond typical Rydberg blockade-based entangling gates.

Motivation: Addressing the limitations of conventional LSTMs, such as high parameter redundancy and limited nonlinear expressivity, by leveraging quantum-inspired techniques.

Method: Integration of Data Re-Uploading Activation (DARUAN) modules into LSTM gating structures, enhanced by quantum variational activation functions (QVAF), and extension to JHCG Net for hierarchical representation.

Result: QKAN-LSTM achieves 79% reduction in trainable parameters with superior predictive accuracy on datasets like Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication.

Conclusion: QKAN-LSTM provides a scalable and interpretable pathway for quantum-inspired sequential modeling, achieving superior performance with reduced parameters.

Abstract: Long short-term memory (LSTM) models are a particular type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are central to sequential modeling tasks in domains such as urban telecommunication forecasting, where temporal correlations and nonlinear dependencies dominate. However, conventional LSTMs suffer from high parameter redundancy and limited nonlinear expressivity. In this work, we propose the Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-Term Memory (QKAN-LSTM), which integrates Data Re-Uploading Activation (DARUAN) modules into the gating structure of LSTMs. Each DARUAN acts as a quantum variational activation function (QVAF), enhancing frequency adaptability and enabling an exponentially enriched spectral representation without multi-qubit entanglement. The resulting architecture preserves quantum-level expressivity while remaining fully executable on classical hardware. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication, demonstrate that QKAN-LSTM achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalization with a 79% reduction in trainable parameters compared to classical LSTMs. We extend the framework to the Jiang-Huang-Chen-Goan Network (JHCG Net), which generalizes KAN to encoder-decoder structures, and then further use QKAN to realize the latent KAN, thereby creating a Hybrid QKAN (HQKAN) for hierarchical representation learning. The proposed HQKAN-LSTM thus provides a scalable and interpretable pathway toward quantum-inspired sequential modeling in real-world data environments.

Result: QK-LSTM outperformed classical LSTM and other quantum sequence models, achieving the highest approximation ratios and fastest convergence rates. It also showed perfect parameter transferability with a fixed set of near-optimal parameters.

Conclusion: The QK-LSTM model demonstrates superior performance in parameter initialization for QAOA, achieving high approximation ratios and fast convergence. Its compact design and quantum kernel architecture make it highly effective for variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading approach for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term quantum processors. However, finding good variational parameters remains a significant challenge due to the non-convex energy landscape, often resulting in slow convergence and poor solution quality. In this work, we propose a quantum meta-learning framework that trains advanced quantum sequence models to generate effective parameter initialization policies. We investigate four classical or quantum sequence models, including the Quantum Kernel-based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM), as learned optimizers in a "learning to learn" paradigm. Our numerical experiments on the Max-Cut problem demonstrate that the QK-LSTM optimizer achieves superior performance, obtaining the highest approximation ratios and exhibiting the fastest convergence rate across all tested problem sizes (n=10 to 13). Crucially, the QK-LSTM model achieves perfect parameter transferability by synthesizing a single, fixed set of near-optimal parameters, leading to a remarkable sustained acceleration of convergence even when generalizing to larger problems. This capability, enabled by the compact and expressive power of the quantum kernel architecture, underscores its effectiveness. The QK-LSTM, with only 43 trainable parameters, substantially outperforms the classical LSTM (56 parameters) and other quantum sequence models, establishing a robust pathway toward highly efficient parameter initialization for variational quantum algorithms in the NISQ era.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A pump-free quantum transduction scheme using color centers and strong coupling generates high-fidelity microwave-optical Bell pairs, addressing heating issues in current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of device heating caused by optical pumps in current quantum transduction approaches, aiming to develop a more efficient and scalable solution for distributed quantum computing.

Method: The method involves creating spin-photon entanglement and converting the spin state into a time-bin-encoded microwave photon using a strongly coupled Purcell-enhanced resonator. Microwave retrieval is heralded by a three-level transmon.

Result: The scheme achieves a heralding rate exceeding one kilohertz for microwave-optical Bell pairs with near-unity fidelity, as confirmed by simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed pump-free scheme, leveraging color centers and a strongly coupled Purcell-enhanced resonator, can generate microwave-optical Bell pairs at high heralding rates with near-unity fidelity, making it a promising solution for distributed quantum computing.

Abstract: Distributed quantum computing involves superconducting computation nodes operating at microwave frequencies, which are connected by long-distance transmission lines that transmit photons at optical frequencies. Quantum transduction, which coherently converts between microwave and optical (M-O) photons, is a critical component of such an architecture. Current approaches are hindered by the unavoidable problem of device heating due to the optical pump. In this work, we propose a pump-free scheme based on color centers that generates time-bin encoded M-O Bell pairs. Our scheme first creates spin-photon entanglement and then converts the spin state into a time-bin-encoded microwave photon using a strongly coupled Purcell-enhanced resonator. In our protocol, the microwave retrieval is heralded by detecting the microwave signal with a three-level transmon. We have analyzed the resulting Bell state fidelity and generation probability of this protocol. Our simulation shows that by combining a state-of-the-art spin-optical interface with our proposed strongly-coupled spin-microwave design, the pump-free scheme can generate M-O Bell pairs at a heralding rate exceeding one kilohertz with near-unity fidelity, which establishes the scheme as a promising source for M-O Bell pairs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of non-decoy QKD schemes and improve loss tolerance in quantum communication, enabling practical long-distance QKD with realistic single-photon sources.

Method: The decoy states are created by modulating the photon number distribution through varying optical excitation of a telecom C-band single-emitter source. The scheme is analyzed using existing security proofs to calculate secret key rates, accounting for finite key effects.

Result: Positive secret key rates were achieved over 227 km of optical fiber, demonstrating a loss tolerance one order of magnitude greater than non-decoy schemes.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of long-distance quantum key distribution (QKD) using a decoy-state scheme with a single-photon source, significantly improving loss tolerance compared to non-decoy schemes. It highlights the potential of such sources in future quantum networks.

Abstract: We implement a decoy-state quantum key distribution scheme using a telecom C-band single- emitter source. The decoy states are created by varying the optical excitation of the quantum emitter to modulate the photon number distribution. We provide an analysis of our scheme based on existing security proofs, allowing the calculation of secret key rates including finite key effects. This enables us to demonstrate, with a realistic single-photon source, positive secret key rates using our scheme over 227 km of optical fiber, equivalent to a loss tolerance one order of magnitude greater than non-decoy schemes. This work broadens the scope of single-photon sources in future quantum networks by enabling long-distance QKD with realistic levels of single-photon purity.

*Minho Luke Kim,Salvatore D. Pace,Shu-Heng Shao*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper identifies a symmetry enforcing Fermi surfaces in quantum lattice fermion models, showing they exhibit non-contractible components and relate to the Onsager algebra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces as a powerful form of symmetry-enforced gaplessness and understand their topological properties.

Method: The method involves identifying a symmetry in quantum lattice fermion models on a d-dimensional Bravais lattice, generated by onsite U(1) fermion number symmetry and non-onsite Majorana translation symmetry.

Result: The results demonstrate that the UV symmetry group for a symmetry-enforced Fermi surface includes a subgroup of the ersatz Fermi liquid's U(1) symmetry group and that these Fermi surfaces exhibit at least two non-contractible components.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces are a realization of symmetry-enforced gaplessness, with the symmetry group closely related to the Onsager algebra. These Fermi surfaces are shown to generically exhibit at least two non-contractible components (open orbits).

Abstract: We identify a symmetry that enforces every symmetric model to have a Fermi surface. These symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces are realizations of a powerful form of symmetry-enforced gaplessness. The symmetry we construct exists in quantum lattice fermion models on a $d$-dimensional Bravais lattice, and is generated by the onsite U(1) fermion number symmetry and non-onsite Majorana translation symmetry. The resulting symmetry group is a non-compact Lie group closely related to the Onsager algebra. For a symmetry-enforced Fermi surface $\cal{F}$, we show that this UV symmetry group always includes the subgroup of the ersatz Fermi liquid L$_{\cal{F}}$U(1) symmetry group formed by even functions ${f(\mathbf{k})\in\mathrm{U}(1)}$ with ${\mathbf{k}\in \cal{F}}$. Furthermore, we comment on the topology of these symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces, proving they generically exhibit at least two non-contractible components (i.e., open orbits).

*Pranay Gorantla,Tzu-Chen Huang*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper investigates symmetry-preserving deformations of LDPC codes under a transverse field, identifying special frustration-free points with unique properties and applying the martingale method to non-commuting projector models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the behavior of LDPC codes under symmetry-preserving deformations and identify special points in the phase diagram that exhibit frustration-free ground states and preserved duality symmetry.

Method: The authors propose symmetry-preserving deformations of LDPC codes under a transverse field and analyze their properties. They use a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph to apply the martingale method, proving the model's gap in the thermodynamic limit.

Result: The study identifies special points where the model is frustration-free, includes product states and code spaces, and remains gapped. It also establishes the first application of the martingale method to non-commuting projector models on arbitrary Tanner graphs.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that symmetry-preserving deformations of LDPC codes under a transverse field can lead to special points with unique properties, including frustration-free ground states and preserved non-invertible duality symmetry. The findings suggest a first-order transition between trivial and nontrivial gapped phases and provide the first application of the martingale method to a non-commuting projector model on arbitrary Tanner graphs.

Abstract: Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are a well known class of Pauli stabiliser Hamiltonians that furnish fixed-point realisations of nontrivial gapped phases such as symmetry breaking and topologically ordered (including fracton) phases. In this work, we propose symmetry-preserving deformations of these models, in the presence of a transverse field, and identify special points along the deformations with interesting features: (i) the special point is frustration-free, (ii) its ground states include a product state and the code space of the underlying code, and (iii) it remains gapped in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly.
  A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph.
  We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice. Of particular interest is the 2+1d transverse field Ising model: while there is no non-invertible duality symmetry in this case, our results, together with known numerical results, suggest the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram.

*Hekai Zhao,Philip Phillips*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Study of Majorana Fermion chains reveals even-odd asymmetry and links 1D phase transition to 2D finite-size scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the even-odd asymmetry and the tri-critical point in interacting Majorana Fermion chains, and understand the phase transition's relation to 2D models.

Method: Analyze interacting Majorana Fermion chains with finite-range pair interactions, introduce a swirling geometrical twist to map 1D chains to 2D models, and use finite-size scaling theory.

Result: Even-odd asymmetry observed; odd case exhibits an exactly solvable point at g=-0.5. The 1D system's transition is predicted by finite-size scaling theory in 2D.

Conclusion: The phase transition in the 1D system can be understood as a finite-system size transition in 2D, with the behavior controlled by a 2D tri-critical universality class at the infinite-range limit.

Abstract: We analyze a series of interacting Majorana Fermion chains with finite range pair interactions with coupling strength $g$ that all exhibit a tri-critical point that separates an Ising critical phase from a supersymmetric gapped phase. We first notice that the interacting models exhibit an even-odd asymmetry depending on the number of sites, $δ$, over which the interaction ranges. The even case exhibits competing order, thereby making it numerically untractable while the odd case exhibits an exactly solvable point at $g=-0.5$ where the entanglement entropy vanishes. By introducing a swirling geometrical twist, we map our 1D $δ$-range chains to a series of 2D $δ/2$-width models. Our new 2D models possess a unique helical boundary condition, constructed from 1D chains with the end of one connected to the start of another. We propose that the phase transition in the 1D system can be understood as a finite-system size transition in 2D. That is, the $g_c-δ$ behavior is controlled by a 2D tri-critical universality class at $δ\to\infty$ limit and is predicted by finite-size scaling theory.

*Gabriel Osiander Rein,Fakher F. Assaad,Igor F. Herbut*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions using quantum Monte Carlo, confirming a weakly first-order O(4N) symmetry breaking transition and superconductivity under a chemical potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the phase transitions in the Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions, particularly the O(4N) symmetry breaking transition from a Dirac semimetal, and to validate the predictions of unified field theory.

Method: A fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is used to study the lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where no sign problem exists.

Result: The O(4N) symmetry breaking transition is observed and is weakly first-order for N=2. The critical coupling and discontinuity size increase with N. A finite chemical potential leads to symmetry breaking and superconductivity. The model also exhibits an exact O(2N) symmetry with a hierarchical order parameter structure.

Conclusion: The study confirms the predicted O(4N) symmetry breaking transition in the Gross-Neveu model for N=2, aligning with unified field theory predictions. The transition is weakly first-order, with details dependent on N. Introducing a finite chemical potential induces superconductivity. The lattice model also exhibits an exact O(2N) symmetry, revealing a hierarchy among order parameters.

Abstract: Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions exhibits a continuous transition from gapless Dirac semimetal to the gapped quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at a finite (attractive) coupling, at which the inversion and time-reversal symmetry become spontaneously broken, and the flavor O($M$) symmetry remains preserved. A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed.

TL;DR: STM reveals impurity-induced charge modulations in black phosphorus, forming distorted triangular patterns with unexpected anisotropy, highlighting potential for impurity-engineered charge orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate anomalous charge modulations induced by ionized impurities and their confinement by nanoscale impurity potential.

Method: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) was used to observe and manipulate charge modulations induced by ionized indium impurities on the surface of black phosphorus.

Result: Periodic charge modulations emerged around impurity centers, forming a distorted triangular pattern, with unchanged periodicity across a wide bias range. The charge orders exhibited anisotropy contrary to Fermi surface expectations.

Conclusion: The experiment demonstrates the possibility of creating and manipulating macroscopic charge orders through impurity engineering.

Abstract: We observe anomalous charge modulations induced by ionized indium impurities on the surface of the semiconductor black phosphorus by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). When the im- purities are switched into a negatively charged state by the STM tip, periodic charge modulations emerge around the impurity center, but strictly confined by the nanoscale impurity potential. These modulations form a distorted triangular pattern, whose periodicity remains unchanged in a wide range of positive bias. Furthermore, these local charge orders exhibit an anisotropy opposite to that expected based on the anisotropy of the Fermi surface, challenging a simple band-structure inter- pretation. Our experiment demonstrates the possibility of creating and manipulating macroscopic charge orders through impurity engineering.

TL;DR: The paper investigates structural transitions in La4Ni3O10, showing a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic change under pressure, with a possible third phase indicated by Raman data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To elucidate the structural phases of La4Ni3O10 under varying temperature and pressure conditions to better understand its superconducting mechanism.

Method: High-pressure and temperature x-ray diffraction on flux-grown single crystals combined with ab initio density-functional theory calculations.

Result: A direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition was observed under pressure, with no trace of an intermediate orthorhombic phase. The transition is a 2-fold superstructure and can be suppressed under high pressure. No structural distortions from density-wave ordering were detected at ambient pressure, though Raman data suggests a potential third phase.

Conclusion: The study conclusively demonstrates a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition in La4Ni3O10 under pressure, with no intermediate orthorhombic phase, and suggests a potential third structural phase linked to density-wave ordering, contrasting Raman measurements.

Abstract: The crux of understanding the superconducting mechanism in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates hinges on elucidating their structural phases. Under ambient conditions, the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 stabilizes in a twinned monoclinic structure with space group P21/c. Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10.
