TL;DR: 通过扭转和应变组合，首次实现堆叠石墨烯中方形moiré图案并揭示强电子相关性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在堆叠石墨烯中通过应变控制实现方形moiré图案的可能性，以研究其电子性质。

Method: 通过选择性位移原生皱纹驱动可逆的结构转变，并采用扫描隧道显微镜和光谱学观察椭圆形状的AA域和电子相关性。利用包含静电相互作用的连续介质模型再现了特定扭转应变组合下的特征。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了通过扭转和应变的组合（即扭转应边电子学）可以在moiré异质结体系中实现先前无法达到的几何结构下的高度相关的电子态。

Abstract: We report the first observation of controlled, strain-induced square moire
patterns in stacked graphene. By selectively displacing native wrinkles, we
drive a reversible transition from the usual trigonal to square moire order.
Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals elliptically shaped AA domains, while
spectroscopy shows strong electronic correlation in the form of narrow bands
with split Van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. A continuum model with
electrostatic interactions reproduces these features under the specific
twist-strain combination that minimizes elastic energy. This work demonstrates
that the combination of twist and strain, or twistraintronics, enables the
realization of highly correlated electronic states in moire heterostructures
with geometries that were previously inaccessible.

*Gian Marcello Andolina,Zeno Bacciconi,Alberto Nardin,Marco Schirò,Peter Rabl,Daniele De Bernardis*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper explains the breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in a specific setup using electrostatic boundary effects and provides testable predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the puzzling breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in a two-dimensional electron gas embedded in a metallic split-ring resonator, which cannot be explained by existing theories.

Method: The researchers analyzed the system using a minimal single-electron model that incorporates both the quantized vacuum field and electrostatic boundary modifications.

Result: The analysis identifies non-chiral edge channels arising from electrostatic boundary effects as a potential mechanism for the breakdown, with predictions that match experimental observations.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical framework that explains the breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in a specific experimental setup and offers testable predictions to distinguish between different mechanisms.

Abstract: We analyze the recently observed breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect
in a two-dimensional electron gas embedded in a metallic split-ring resonator.
By accounting for both the quantized vacuum field and electrostatic boundary
modifications, we identify a mechanism that could potentially explain this
breakdown in terms of non-chiral edge channels arising from electrostatic
boundary effects. For experimentally relevant geometries, a minimal
single-electron model of this mechanism predicts characteristic signatures and
energy scales consistent with those observed in experiments. These predictions
can be directly tested against alternative, purely vacuum-induced explanations
to shed further light on the origin of this puzzling phenomenon.

### [3] [Direct Visualization of the Magnetic Monopole Field in a 3D Artificial Spin Ice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04877)
*Arjen van den Berg,Peter Rickhaus,Frank Barrows,Cristiano Nisoli,Sam Ladak*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Using advanced fabrication and imaging techniques, researchers visualized and characterized magnetic monopoles in a 3D spin-ice lattice, revealing their complex interactions governed by nanoscale geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To directly visualize the three-dimensional field structure of magnetic monopoles in spin-ice systems, which had never been achieved before.

Method: Two-photon lithography and scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry were used to fabricate and measure the 3D artificial spin-ice lattice.

Result: Monopoles in 3DASI are non-trivial micromagnetic entities with both magnetic charge and intrinsic moment, exhibiting tunable interactions based on local geometry.

Conclusion: The findings establish 3D artificial spin-ice as a programmable magnetic metamaterial where nanoscale geometry controls the energetics and dynamics of emergent magnetic charges.

Abstract: Magnetic monopoles, long hypothesised as fundamental particles carrying
isolated magnetic charge, emerge in spin-ice systems as fractionalised
excitations governed by the ice rule. Yet their three-dimensional field
structure has never been directly visualised. Here, we use two-photon
lithography and processing to fabricate a fully three-dimensional artificial
spin-ice lattice with diamond-bond geometry. We then use scanning
nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry to directly measure the stray magnetic fields of
both charge-neutral and monopole vertices. We find that ice-rule vertices
produce antivortex textures directly above their vertices, stabilised by the
local frustrated two-in/two out ordering principle. Direct imaging of the
monopole stray field shows a highly divergent profile. By correlating
experiment with micromagnetic simulations and performing a multipole expansion
of the reconstructed magnetisation, we reveal that monopoles in 3DASI are
non-trivial micromagnetic entities, carrying both magnetic charge and an
intrinsic moment, giving rise to anisotropic interactions that are dependent
upon the quasiparticles position on the lattice. Results suggest that as
monopoles separate under an applied field, the dipolar contribution to their
interaction reorients relative to the underlying Coulombic field, revealing
that monopole coupling is tunable through geometry, being set by the local
vertex topology. These findings establish 3DASI as a programmable magnetic
metamaterial in which nanoscale geometry governs the energetics and dynamics of
emergent magnetic charges.

Motivation: To discover and characterize the in-plane quantization (IPQ) state in trilayer magnetic topological insulators and understand its link to gap-closing behavior and quantized criticality.

Method: Temperature and gate-dependent transport measurements, supported by a self-consistent approximation model.

Result: Discovery of an IPQ state with quantized longitudinal conductivity of e2/h under strong in-plane magnetic fields, revealing the dominance of electron-hole puddles in charge transport due to impurity disorder.

Conclusion: These findings establish a tunable experimental framework connecting gap-closing physics with universal conductivity, providing insights into critical transport in magnetic topological insulators and a platform for probing quantum criticality in topological systems.

Abstract: We report the discovery of an in plane quantization (IPQ) state in trilayer
magnetic topological insulators, characterized by a quantized longitudinal
conductivity of e2/h under strong in-plane magnetic fields. This state emerges
at a quantum critical point separating quantum anomalous Hall phases tuned by
field angle and orientation, directly linking gap-closing behavior to quantized
criticality. Temperature and gate dependent transport measurements, supported
by a self consistent approximation model, reveal that electron hole puddles
dominate charge transport in this regime, highlighting the essential role of
impurity disorder in stabilizing quantized critical transport. These findings
establish a tunable experimental framework that connects gap-closing physics
with universal conductivity, offering both microscopic insight into critical
transport in magnetic topological insulators and a robust platform for probing
quantum criticality in topological systems.

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，通过研究对称胶体量子点中的三重态激子，可以有效克服传统双态激子系统中超精细相互作用对光子偏振纠缠的限制，实现更高的纠缠度。此外，研究还发现量子点的形状各向异性和应变可以完全抑制超精细相互作用的负面影响，这代表了半导体量子点生成纠缠光子对的终极极限。

Abstract: The polarization entanglement of photons emitted by semiconductor quantum
dots is unavoidably limited by the spin fluctuations of the host lattice
nuclei. To overcome this limitation, we develop a theory of entangled photon
pair generation by a symmetric colloidal quantum dot mediated by a triplet
exciton. We derive general analytical expressions for the concurrence as a
function of the hyperfine interaction strength and show that it is
intrinsically higher than that in conventional doublet-exciton systems such as
self-assembled quantum dots. The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape
anisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a
possibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine
interaction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and
electron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate
limit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum
dots.

### [6] [Unexpected increase of intensity-dependent excitonic second- and third-harmonic generation induced by static electric fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05112)
*Ruixin Zuo,Matthias Reichelt,Cong Ngo,Xiaohong Song,Weifeng Yang,Torsten Meier*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Study shows SHG and THG in MoS2 depend on static fields and optical intensity, revealing new control methods for exciton dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complex dependencies of SHG and THG on static electric field strength and optical excitation intensity in systems with strongly bound excitons.

Method: Solving the semiconductor Bloch equations to analyze excitonic second- and third-harmonic generation under static electric fields, with simulations focused on MoS2 homobilayers.

Result: For intense optical excitation, THG increases and SHG increases superlinearly with the static field amplitude until exciton ionization dominates, driven by effects like Stark shifts and Rabi oscillations.

Conclusion: The findings open new possibilities for controlling the strong-field dynamics of systems with strongly bound excitons, particularly through the interplay of various effects like Stark shifts and exciton ionization.

Abstract: We compute and analyze the dependence of excitonic second- and third-harmonic
generation (SHG/THG) as a function of the optical excitation intensity in the
presence of static electric fields by solving the semiconductor Bloch
equations. Our simulations are performed for excitation of the strongly bound
intralayer exciton of an inversion-symmetric homobilayer of MoS2 with in-plane
electric fields. We demonstrate that for resonant excitation at the 1s
K-exciton the SHG and the THG show complex dependencies on both the strength of
the static field and the peak amplitude of the optical pulse. For sufficiently
intense optical excitation, the THG increases and the SHG increases
superlinearly with the amplitude of the static field as long as exciton
ionization is not yet dominating. Microscopic simulations demonstrate that
these dependencies arise from an interplay between several effects including
static and transient Stark shifts, exciton ionization, Wannier-Stark
localization, off-resonant Rabi oscillations, and a modified interference
between optical nonlinearities induced by the intraband acceleration. Our
findings offer several new possibilities for controlling the strong-field
dynamics of systems with strongly bound excitons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the intrinsic spin dynamics and transport properties of altermagnets, which hold great potential for spintronic applications but remain largely unexplored.

Method: Investigation of spin-resolved quantum transport in a multi-terminal setup based on a $d$-wave altermagnet.

Result: Altermagnetic spin splitting induces spin precession in real space, leading to characteristic spin patterns and a modulated Hall voltage. The setup functions as a prototype for an efficient spin transistor.

Conclusion: The study identifies a fingerprint signature of altermagnets and provides a direct probe of altermagnetic spin splitting, bridging fundamental physics with practical spintronic applications.

Abstract: Altermagnets hold great potential for spintronic applications, yet their
intrinsic spin dynamics and associated transport properties remain largely
unexplored. Here, we investigate spin-resolved quantum transport in a
multi-terminal setup based on a $d$-wave altermagnet. It is found that the
altermagnetic spin splitting in momentum space induces an interesting spin
precession in real space, giving rise to characteristic spin patterns. This
altermagnetic spin precession manifests as a spatial modulation of the Hall
voltage, whose oscillation period provides a direct measure of the
spin-splitting strength. When the altermagnetism is electrically tunable, the
proposed setup functions as a prototype for a highly efficient spin transistor.
The key physical effects are shown to be robust against dephasing and
crystalline warping. Our work not only identifies a fingerprint signature of
altermagnets, offering a direct probe of the altermagnetic spin splitting, but
also represents an important step toward bridging their fundamental physics
with practical spintronic applications.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Study reveals quantum fluctuation effects in spin dynamics, identifying a new spin transfer channel and potential for quantum random number generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of quantum fluctuations in the disentanglement-entanglement-disentanglement dynamics of itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments under the s-d exchange interaction.

Method: The study extends the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to include quantum and thermal stochastic fields, investigating the effects of quantum fluctuations on spin dynamics.

Result: Identification of an intrinsic channel for spin quantum fluctuation transfer, with quantum fluctuations dominating spin dynamics in a specific temperature regime. Voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy can exponentially amplify these fluctuations.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a microscopic framework for quantum fluctuation-driven spin dynamics and proposes a fundamental route toward spin-based quantum true random number generation.

Abstract: We investigate quantum fluctuation effects arising from the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle governing angular momentum operators in the full
dynamical evolution of disentanglement-entanglement-disentanglement between
itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments under the s-d exchange
interaction. Beyond the conventional deterministic spin-transfer torque, we
identify an intrinsic channel for the transfer of spin quantum fluctuations. By
extending the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to include both quantum and
thermal stochastic fields, we reveal a temperature regime where quantum
fluctuations dominate spin dynamics. Furthermore, voltage-controlled magnetic
anisotropy can exponentially amplify these quantum fluctuation signals,
enabling their binary detection via tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic
tunnel junctions. These results establish a microscopic framework for quantum
fluctuation-driven spin dynamics and provide a fundamental route toward
spin-based quantum true random number generation.

### [9] [Short-range Spin Freezing State in the Double Trillium Lattice Spin-Liquid Candidate KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ Revealed via $^{31}$P NMR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04866)
*Sebin J. Sebastian,Q. -P. Ding,A. A. Tsirlin,R. Nath,Y. Furukawa*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ has a complex magnetic ground state with spin freezing and dynamics, driven by frustration, not disorder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the nature of the magnetic ground state in the $S = 5/2$ double trillium lattice antiferromagnet KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$, which was previously conjectured to be either a 3D long-range order or a pure gapless spin-liquid state.

Method: A combination of $^{31}$P NMR, thermodynamic measurements, and first-principle band-structure calculations.

Result: The experimental results show no conventional 3D long-range order or pure spin-liquid state. Instead, the system exhibits spin freezing with persistent dynamics below a characteristic temperature $T^{*}$, driven by intrinsic magnetic frustration.

Conclusion: The study reveals that KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ exhibits a complex magnetic ground state with coexisting spin freezing and persistent dynamics, primarily due to intrinsic magnetic frustration rather than intersite disorder. This positions it as a promising platform for exploring exotic phenomena in 3D frustrated magnets.

Abstract: A comprehensive $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study, combined
with thermodynamic measurements and first-principle band-structure
calculations, has been conducted to explore the ground state of the $S = 5/2$
double trillium lattice antiferromagnet KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$. Our experimental
results indicate that the magnetic ground state is neither a conventional
three-dimensional (3D) long-range order (LRO) nor a pure gapless spin-liquid
state, as conjectured previously [Boya et al., APL Mater. 10, 101103 (2022)].
Specifically, the observation of a nearly field-independent NMR linewidth below
$T^{*}$ = (3.5 $\pm$ 0.4) K, and a significant enhancement of spin-spin
relaxation rate $1/T_2$ below $2T^{*}$ (where $T^{*}$ is the characteristic
temperature identified from the magnetic susceptibility), indicate a complex
magnetic ground state where spin freezing coexists with persistent dynamics.
Furthermore, we argue that the lack of magnetic LRO and the persistence of
strong magnetic fluctuations in KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ are unlikely to originate
from intersite K/Sr disorder, rather arise due to intrinsic magnetic
frustration. Our findings position KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ into a broader family
of geometrically frustrated magnets characterized by coexisting spin freezing
and pronounced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, marking it as a promising
platform for investigating exotic phenomena in 3D frustrated magnets.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The research investigates anomalous transport in ZrV6Sn6 Kagome metal, finding LMR behavior explained by a modified Abrikosov model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the anomalous transport properties in 166-type Kagome metal ZrV6Sn6 single crystals, particularly the anisotropy of magnetoresistance, and explain it using the Abrikosov model.

Method: The study integrates Hall resistivity and quantum oscillation measurements, and extrapolates the Abrikosov model to account for two-dimensional linear dispersion.

Result: The study found that the linear magnetoresistance (LMR) matches the Abrikosov model, but its anisotropy required extending the model to two-dimensional linear dispersion.

Conclusion: The modified Abrikosov model successfully interprets the macroscopic quantum transport in ZrV6Sn6 crystals, providing a new perspective for understanding LMR behavior.

Abstract: The Kagome lattice has attracted extensive attention due to the diverse
magnetic properties and non-trivial electronic states generated by its unique
atomic arrangement, which provides an excellent system for exploring
macroscopic quantum behavior. Here, we report the anomalous transport
properties in 166-type Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ single crystals. The
quadratic and linear magnetoresistance (LMR) can be observed depending on the
directions of the field and the current. Integrating Hall resistivity and
quantum oscillation measurements, we found that the LMR could match well with
the Abrikosov model. However, this model encounters difficulties in explaining
the anisotropy of the magnetoresistance. To solve the issue, we extrapolate the
Abrikosov model to the case of two-dimensional linear dispersion. It was found
that when the field is parallel to the linear dependence momentum, the
quantized energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{p^2+2eHn/c}$, resulting in
LMR. By contrast, when it is parallel to the non-linear dependence momentum,
the energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{2eHn/c}$, without yielding LMR.
Through the combination of experiment and theory, the modified Abrikosov model
could interpret the macroscopic quantum transport in ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystal. The
present research provides a new perspective for understanding the LMR behavior.

Method: 研究采用了粉末平均非弹性中子散射、磁化强度数据、一阶二聚体扩展计算和量子蒙特卡罗模拟，并结合X射线光谱和透射电子显微镜技术。

Result: 研究发现，Cu$_5$SbO$_6$中存在交替的铁磁-反铁磁耦合的自旋链，其耦合机制为$J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$模型，而非预期的$J_3$耦合。同时，还改进了晶体结构和堆叠缺陷模型。

Conclusion: 研究的结论揭示了Cu$_5$SbO$_6$中独特的磁性耦合机制，即$J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$模型，并修正了其晶体结构和堆叠缺陷模型。

Abstract: We analyze powder-averaged inelastic neutron scattering and magnetization
data for the distorted honeycomb compound Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ using a first-order
dimer expansion calculation and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We show that,
in contrast to the previously proposed honeycomb lattice model, Cu$_5$SbO$_6$
accommodates interacting dimerized spin chains with alternating
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic couplings along the chain. Moreover, unlike the
typical couplings observed in other Cu$^{2+}$-based distorted honeycomb
magnets, the spin chains in Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ primarily couple through an
antiferromagnetic coupling $J_4$ that arises between the honeycomb layers,
rather than the expected interchain $J_3$ coupling in the layers. This finding
reveals a different magnetic coupling scheme, $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$, for
Cu$_5$SbO$_6$. In addition, utilizing x-ray spectroscopy and transmission
electron microscopy, we also refine the crystal structure and stacking-fault
model of the compound.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of quasiparticle hybridization in quantum simulation platforms and explores the unique properties of compact localized states (CLS) in the chiral spin liquid described by the Yao-Kivelson model.

Method: The study employs a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians to derive exact expressions for CLS across various flux configurations, including both topological and trivial phases of the Yao-Kivelson model.

Result: The study demonstrates the absence of hybridization for CLS, which form due to destructive quantum interference and populate flat quasiparticle bands. It also constructs compact localized Majorana zero modes for non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of CLS in enabling non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons and advancing the quantum simulation of topologically ordered states, while also broadening the exploration of flat-band physics in quantum spin liquids.

Abstract: Quasiparticle hybridization remains a major challenge to realizing and
controlling exotic states of matter in existing quantum simulation platforms.
We report the absence of hybridization for compact localized states (CLS)
emerging in the chiral spin liquid described by the Yao-Kivelson model. The CLS
form due to destructive quantum interference at fine-tuned coupling constants
and populate perfectly flat quasiparticle bands on an effective kagome lattice.
Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact
expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the
topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy
matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct
compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $\pi$-flux excitations, which
enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation. Our
results inform the quantum simulation of topologically ordered states of matter
and open avenues for exploring flat-band physics in quantum spin liquids.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity and tediousness of traditional perturbation theory derivations, aiming to simplify and enhance high-order calculations.

Method: The method involves a systematic formula based on integer partitions that generates perturbation theory at any order, using a single matrix equation for eigenvalue and eigenvector corrections.

Result: The formula successfully generates perturbation theory at arbitrary orders, includes an infinite number of perturbations, and reduces to the standard case of one perturbation as a limit.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel and efficient systematic formula for perturbation theory, streamlining traditional tedious derivations and enabling high-order calculations.

Abstract: We provide a systematic formula, in terms of integer partitions, that
generates perturbation theory explicitly at an arbitrary order. Our approach
naturally includes an infinite number of perturbations and uses a single matrix
equation that contains the information for both the eigenvalue and eigenvector
corrections. The formula reduces to the standard case of one perturbation in
the appropriate limit. This formulation streamlines the derivations that are
traditionally tedious in perturbation theory, facilitating high-order
calculations.

*Carlos Eduardo S. P. Corsino,Hermann Freire*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper investigates the HK model's ordering tendencies, revealing intertwined CDW and PDW orders under strong interactions, with magnetic fields and strain influencing their formation differently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the competing ordering tendencies exhibited by the exactly solvable 2D Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model on a square lattice.

Method: Investigation of the interplay between superconductivity, charge-density wave (CDW), and pair-density wave (PDW) orders as a function of interaction, doping parameter, magnetic field, and uniaxial strain.

Result: Confirmation of the intertwined nature of CDW and PDW fluctuating orders for intermediate-to-strong couplings. Verification that magnetic fields favor CDW formation and subsequent PDW emergence, while strain effects favor unidirectional PDW as a primary order.

Conclusion: The study underscores the HK model's value in exploring charge order and unconventional superconductivity in strongly interacting fermionic systems. It also highlights the relevance of an orbital generalization of the HK model for describing realistic strongly correlated systems.

Abstract: We provide here a study of some competing ordering tendencies exhibited by
the exactly solvable 2D Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model on a square lattice. To
this end, we investigate the interplay between superconductivity,
charge-density wave (CDW) and pair-density wave (PDW) orders as a function of
interaction, doping parameter, magnetic field, and uniaxial strain. As a
result, we confirm the intertwined nature of CDW and PDW fluctuating orders for
intermediate-to-strong couplings. We also verify that, while an applied
magnetic field favors the formation of a CDW and allows the subsequent
emergence of a PDW as a secondary order, strain effects favor unidirectional
PDW as a primary order over the subdominant appearance of a stripe-like CDW.
These results underscore the value of the HK model as an interesting platform
in order to investigate (via an exactly solvable framework) the emergence of
charge order and unconventional superconductivity in fermionic systems with
strong interactions. Finally, we briefly discuss an orbital generalization of
the HK model, which has been recently argued to be relevant to describe the
properties of realistic strongly correlated systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the often contradictory effects of the nearest neighbor Coulomb repulsion (V) and understand its role in destroying homogeneity in different concentration regimes, particularly in non-integrable systems.

Method: The study employs exact results and analysis based on positive semidefinite operator properties to investigate the effects of nearest neighbor Coulomb repulsion (V).

Result: The nearest neighbor Coulomb repulsion (V) destroys homogeneity in high concentration regimes, a phenomenon absent in low concentration domains. The exact ground states derived are for non-integrable systems.

Conclusion: The nearest neighbor Coulomb repulsion (V) plays a critical role in destroying homogeneity in high concentration regimes, highlighting that its effects are not necessarily tied to the phases it acts upon but may be intrinsically linked to V itself. The study provides exact ground states for non-integrable systems, utilizing positive semidefinite operator properties.

Abstract: Exact results are presented for itinerant systems
  demonstrating that the nearest neighbor Coulomb
  repulsion (V) destroys the homogeneity in the high concentration regime, this
  property being not present in the low concentration domain. Since the effects
  of V often seems contradictory, and the number of phases in which it could
  appear is extremely large, this result underlines that the action of the
  nearest neighbor repulsion is not necessarily routed in the characteristics
  of phases on which it acts, but could be intimately related to V itself.
  The $V > 0$ case usually means non-integrability, hence the deduced exact
  ground states are related to non-integrable systems, the technique being
  based on positive semidefinite operator properties.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A framework using on-shell amplitudes simplifies the study of relativistic quantum matter, demonstrated by calculating the nonlinear Hall effect in Dirac semimetals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many strongly correlated systems exhibit low-energy excitations that behave like massless relativistic spinors, making traditional methods complex.

Method: Proposing a framework using on-shell scattering amplitude methods to derive physical observables like nonlinear optical and Hall responses, bypassing Feynman diagrams.

Result: The nonlinear Hall conductivity of a Dirac semimetal is derived from a single parity-odd three-photon amplitude.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the analytic and conceptual power of amplitude-based approaches for strongly correlated condensed-matter systems.

Abstract: We propose a framework for applying on-shell scattering amplitude methods to
emergent relativistic phases of quantum matter. Many strongly correlated
systems, from Dirac and Weyl semimetals to topological-insulator surfaces,
exhibit low-energy excitations that are effectively massless relativistic
spinors. We show that physical observables such as nonlinear optical and Hall
responses can be obtained from compact on-shell amplitudes, bypassing the
complexity of Feynman diagrams. As a concrete demonstration, we derive the
nonlinear Hall conductivity of a Dirac semimetal from a single parity-odd
three-photon amplitude, highlighting the analytic and conceptual power of
amplitude-based approaches for strongly correlated condensed-matter systems.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper reports the growth and characterization of UCr₆Ge₆, revealing unique itinerant 5f-electron behavior and Pauli paramagnetism, distinct from localized behavior in other uranium 166 compounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The underrepresentation of 5f members in the RM₆X₆ family and the potential for emergent phenomena due to interactions between f- and d-electron lattices motivated the study of UCr₆Ge₆.

Method: Single-crystal growth of UCr₆Ge₆ was performed, and its structure was analyzed, revealing a monoclinically distorted Y₀.₅Co₃Ge₃-type structure. The study utilized band structure calculations and measured properties like electronic heat capacity, magnetization, and resistivity.

Result: UCr₆Ge₆ exhibits kagome-lattice flatbands near the Fermi level and a moderately enhanced electronic heat capacity. It shows small, isotropic magnetization and featureless resistivity, indicating itinerant uranium 5f electrons and Pauli paramagnetism.

Conclusion: The study highlights the high tunability of the magnetic ground state in the RM₆X₆ family, as evidenced by the unique behavior of UCr₆Ge₆ with itinerant uranium 5f electrons and Pauli paramagnetism, contrasting with localized behavior in other uranium 166 compounds.

Abstract: The chemical flexibility of the $RM_6X_6$ stoichiometry, where an $f$-block
element is intercalated in the CoSn structure type, allows for the tuning of
flatbands associated with kagome lattices to the Fermi level and for emergent
phenomena due to interactions between the $f$- and $d$-electron lattices. Yet,
5$f$ members of the "166" compounds are underrepresented compared with 4$f$
members. Here, we report single-crystal growth of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$, which
crystallizes in a monoclinically distorted Y$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$-type
structure. The real-space character of the modulation, which is unique within
the $RM_6X_6$ family, is approximated by a 3$\times$1$\times$2 supercell of the
average monoclinic cell. The compound has kagome-lattice flatbands near the
Fermi level and a moderately enhanced electronic heat capacity, as evidenced by
its low-temperature Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma=86.5$ mJ mol$^{-1}$
K$^{-2}$) paired with band structure calculations. The small, isotropic
magnetization and featureless resistivity of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$ suggest itinerant
uranium 5$f$ electrons and Pauli paramagnetism. The isotropic magnetic behavior
of the uranium 5$f$ electrons starkly contrasts with localized behavior in
other uranium 166 compounds, highlighting the high tunability of the magnetic
ground state across the material family.

TL;DR: The YSYK model bridges single-particle and many-body chaos, offering insights into intermediate dynamical regimes and experimental feasibility with ultra-cold atoms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between integrable and chaotic quantum systems, the study explores the YSYK model as a framework that naturally connects single-particle and many-body chaos.

Method: Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model was performed, comparing it with SYK2 and SYK4 benchmark models.

Result: The YSYK model's interaction strength acts as a tunable parameter between SYK2 and SYK4 limits, revealing distinct dynamical regimes like partial ergodicity breaking and prethermalization plateaus.

Conclusion: The YSYK model serves as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observations of these phenomena through feasible optical-cavity implementations using ultra-cold atoms.

Abstract: Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic
behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev
(SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and
holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving
intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK)
model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and
demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos.
Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive
finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction
strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$
and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative
comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover
distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking,
prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a
feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold
atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting
single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental
observation of these phenomena.

TL;DR: A trapped-ion protocol uses a monitor qubit to track magnetic-field drifts in real-time, improving coherence and experimental efficiency in quantum processors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To track magnetic-field drifts in real-time without interrupting data-qubit operations, enabling real-time corrections and improved performance.

Method: Utilizing two $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ions and the optical-metastable-ground architecture, with data qubit in the ground-state manifold and monitor qubit in a metastable-state manifold for spectral separation.

Result: The protocol maintains coherence under realistic magnetic noise, extends usable data-qubit probe times by ~$ackslash sqrt{2}$, and doubles the experimental duty cycle.

Conclusion: Monitor qubits serve as a scalable tool for real-time recalibration in quantum information processors, significantly enhancing coherence and experimental efficiency.

Abstract: We demonstrate a trapped-ion protocol in which a nearby, dedicated "monitor"
qubit tracks magnetic-field drifts in real time without interrupting data-qubit
operations. Using two $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^+$ ions and the
optical--metastable--ground architecture, we encode the data qubit in the
ground-state manifold and the monitor qubit in a metastable-state manifold to
achieve spectral separation. The monitor qubit senses common magnetic
fluctuations during data-qubit experiments, enabling feedforward corrections to
the qubit-control drives. Under applied magnetic noise with a realistic
spectrum ($1/f^{2}$), the protocol maintains coherence and, when compared with
interleaved calibration, it extends usable data-qubit probe times by up to a
factor of ${\sim}\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the experimental duty cycle. These
results establish monitor qubits as a scalable tool for real-time recalibration
in quantum information processors.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A security evaluation framework revealed vulnerabilities in quantum circuit obfuscation, showing that split compilation can be compromised using minimal I/O pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the proposed quantum circuit obfuscation (QCO) techniques, there has been a lack of thorough security evaluations to assess their resilience against attacks.

Method: An oracle-guided security evaluation framework was proposed to test candidate connections systematically, using input-output observations and iterative pruning of inconsistent mappings.

Result: Experiments on the RevLib benchmark suite demonstrated that a small number of I/O pairs is sufficient to recover inter-split connections and reconstruct the entire circuit.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the necessity of thorough security evaluations in quantum IP protection and highlights vulnerabilities in existing QCO techniques.

Abstract: Quantum circuits are the fundamental representation of quantum algorithms and
constitute valuable intellectual property (IP). Multiple quantum circuit
obfuscation (QCO) techniques have been proposed in prior research to protect
quantum circuit IP against malicious compilers. However, there has not been a
thorough security evaluation of these schemes. In this work, we investigate the
resilience of split compilation against an oracle-guided attack. Split
compilation is one of the most studied QCO techniques, where the circuit to be
compiled is split into two disjoint partitions. Each split circuit is known to
the compiler, but the interconnections between them are hidden. We propose an
oracle-guided security evaluation framework in which candidate connections are
systematically tested against input-output observations, with iteratively
pruned inconsistent mappings. This hierarchical matching process exploits the
reversibility of quantum gates and reduces the search space compared to
brute-force enumeration. Experimental evaluation in the RevLib benchmark suite
shows that only a small number of I/O pairs are sufficient to recover the
correct inter-split connections and reconstruct the entire circuits. Our study
marks the first thorough security evaluations in quantum IP protection and
highlights the necessity of such evaluations in the development of new
protection schemes.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A hybrid CV-DV interferometer with a single qubit ancilla and CF gates suppresses thermal noise in bosonic codes to O(η²) without active correction, achieving high success rates and resilience to ancilla noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of noise suppression in quantum information processing, particularly for bosonic codes corrupted by thermal noise.

Method: A hybrid continuous-discrete-variable (CV-DV) interferometer with a single qubit ancilla and two controlled-Fourier (CF) gates is employed to suppress noise effects without active error correction or destructive measurements.

Result: The scheme suppresses noise to O(η²) with success probabilities >0.5 under certain conditions, and bosonic codes with like-parity photon-number states are completely resilient to DV amplitude- and phase-damping ancilla noise.

Conclusion: The study introduces a hybrid CV-DV interferometer scheme using a single qubit ancilla and controlled-Fourier gates to achieve noise suppression to O(η²) for bosonic codes, demonstrating high success probabilities and resilience to ancilla noise.

Abstract: Noise suppression is of paramount importance for reliable quantum information
processing and computation. We show that for any single-mode bosonic code
(qumode) corrupted by thermal~noise at rate~$\eta$ and mean
\mbox{excitation}~$\bar{n}$, a hybrid continuous-discrete-variable~(CV-DV)
interferometer using only a single qubit ancilla~(DV) and two
controlled~Fourier~(CF) gates sandwiching the noise channel suppresses its
effects to $\mathcal{O}(\eta^2)$ \emph{without} any active error correction or
destructive measurements of the encoded state and with high success
probabilities~$>0.5$ if~$\eta(1+\bar{n})<0.5$. This suppression scheme works by
conditionally monitoring the photon-number parities after the interferometer.
Bosonic codes with two logical states of the same photon-number parity
(like-parity codes) are \emph{completely resilient} to DV amplitude- and
phase-damping ancilla noise. For such codes, the interferometer simplifies to
the use of a qumode rotation gate and a \emph{single} CF~gate. This presents a
clear advantage of our CF-gate-based error suppression scheme over
previously-proposed ``bypass'' protocols, where qubit information transferred
to the DV mode is readily corrupted by damping~noise. Finally, we present a
simple extension to direct communication of qumode states between two parties
over a noisy channel using a preshared DV entangled state, by implementing a CF
gate in the first laboratory and its inverse in the other. Such a communication
protocol achieves a similar fidelity performance at the same success rate as
the single-party case, but with greater resilience to the ancilla noise than
DV~teleportation. Resource-efficient multi-qubit codes that depend on a few
essential long-range interactions can benefit from it.

TL;DR: A programmable pulsed source improves quantum gate fidelity and robustness in trapped-ion systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of scaling quantum gates by overcoming limitations in current pulsed sources for trapped-ion systems.

Method: Utilizes a programmable pulsed source for flexible control of pulse intensity, waveform, and phase profiles, enabling precise manipulation of pulse sequences and implementation of STIRARP protocols.

Result: Simulation results demonstrate high gate fidelities and strong robustness against pulse variations.

Conclusion: The proposed programmable pulsed source enhances the fidelity and robustness of ultrafast quantum gates, achieving simulations with fidelities above 99.99%.

Abstract: Scaling of quantum gates remains a central challenge in quantum information
science. Ultrafast gates based on spin-dependent kicks provide a promising
approach for trapped-ion systems. However, these gates require laser pulses
with both high temporal tunability and stability, which are difficult to
achieve with existing pulsed sources. Here, we propose a programmable pulsed
source that allows flexible control of pulse intensity, waveform, and phase
profiles. This enables precise manipulation of pulse sequences, thereby
improving the fidelity of entangling gates. Furthermore, since the pulse
parameters can be conveniently tuned, various coherent population-transfer
schemes can be implemented adiabatic SDKs, thereby improving both the fidelity
and robustness of fast quantum gate. Simulation results show that our
programmable pulse system can achieve gate fidelities above 99.99% with strong
robustness against variations in pulse intensity and single-photon detuning
using stimulated Raman adiabatic rapid passage (STIRARP) protocols.

*Sareh Askari,Youssef Kora,Christoph Simon*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Moderate entanglement between input qubits boosts short-term memory in spin-network reservoir computing, with performance peaking at small coupling strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how entanglement and its distribution in a spin-network reservoir impact the performance of reservoir computing in a distributed scenario.

Method: Investigating the influence of entanglement and its localization on reservoir performance, focusing on bilinear memory tasks and using logarithmic negativity as a measure of bipartite entanglement.

Result: Short-term memory capacity peaks at small coupling strengths, while average entanglement peaks at larger couplings. Entanglement between input qubits is strongest and most relevant for task performance.

Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that moderate entanglement, especially between the two input qubits, significantly enhances short-term memory performance in distributed reservoir computing.

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a promising neuromorphic paradigm, and its quantum
implementation using spin networks has shown some advantage when entanglement
is present. Here, we consider a distributed scenario in which two distinct
input time series are injected into separate qubits of a spin-network
reservoir. We investigate how the overall entanglement, as well as its
localization in the system, influence the performance of the reservoir.
Focusing on bilinear memory tasks that require computing the product of the two
inputs, we evaluate the short-term memory capacity and correlate it with
logarithmic negativity as a measure of bipartite entanglement. We find that
short-term memory capacity reaches its maximum at relatively small coupling
strengths. In contrast, average entanglement peaks at larger couplings.
Analyzing entanglement across all bipartitions, we find that the entanglement
between the two input qubits is consistently the strongest and most relevant
for task performance. In the small coupling strength regime where the
short-term memory capacity is maximized, the reservoir exhibits an extended
memory tail: performance remains high for a long time. Finally, a pronounced
dip in performance at zero time delay, observed across frequencies, indicates
that information requires a finite propagation time through the reservoir
before it can be effectively recalled. In summary, our results show that
moderate entanglement, particularly between the two input qubits, plays a key
role in enhancing short-term memory performance.

TL;DR: The study explores hidden symmetry in the asymmetric quantum Rabi model, linking it to energy-level matching in a double-well potential and identifying an excited-state quantum phase transition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to identify the origin of hidden symmetry in the asymmetric quantum Rabi model and its explicit operator form, especially in the less-explored strong-coupling regime.

Method: The method involves two successive diagonalizations, focusing on the regime where the ratio between the two-level splitting and the mode frequency is significantly greater than 1.

Result: The hidden symmetry arises from energy-level matching in the asymmetric double-well potential, supported by wavefunction analysis. The paper also identifies an excited-state quantum phase transition due to the breaking and restoration of hidden symmetry.

Conclusion: The paper provides deeper insight into the physics of the asymmetric quantum Rabi model, particularly in the strong-coupling regime, by identifying the origin of hidden symmetry and discussing the emergence of an excited-state quantum phase transition.

Abstract: The introduction of an asymmetric term into the quantum Rabi model generally
lifts energy-level degeneracies. However, when the asymmetry parameter takes
specific multiples of the bosonic mode frequency, level degeneracies
reappear$-$a phenomenon referred to as the hidden symmetry in the asymmetric
quantum Rabi model. Identifying the origin of this hidden symmetry and its
explicit operator form constitutes two central tasks in studying this system.
Here, we investigate the origin of this hidden symmetry using the method of two
successive diagonalizations, with a focus on physics in the regime where the
ratio between the two-level splitting $\Delta$ and the mode frequency $\omega$
satisfies $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$. We find that the hidden symmetry stems from
energy-level matching within the asymmetric double-well potential, a picture
strongly supported by the wavefunctions of both the ground and excited states.
Moreover, the emergence of an excited-state quantum phase transition is
identified and qualitatively discussed, which arises from the breaking and
restoration of this hidden symmetry across different coupling regimes. Our
results provide deeper insight into the physics of the asymmetric quantum Rabi
model, particularly in the previously less-explored strong-coupling regime
where $\Delta/\omega \gg 1$.

Conclusion: 本文展示了在多量子比特系统中纠缠冻结现象的普遍性，并提供了控制冻结时间和冻结值的方法。

Abstract: In a system where two identical two-level atoms interact with their common
one-mode cavity field, it is shown that entanglement can become abruptly frozen
in time, remaining at a constant value for a period of time until it begins to
thaw from this value from the entanglement sharing perspective [Ding et al.,
Phys. Rev. A 103, 032418 (2021)]. We generalize this exotic behavior of
entanglement sharing dynamics to more general systems with arbitrary N qubits,
instead of restricting to the atom-cavity mode interaction system. We also
demonstrate methods to control the entanglement freezing time and freezing
value, and we discover a nontrivial dynamics where entanglement is frozen
permanently. In addition, we show that this phenomenon is not a coincidence but
a universal feature in a variety of systems with a geometric explanation of the
mechanisms.

Motivation: The coherence of superconducting quantum computers is limited by material defects (TLS), but understanding their creation and impact on qubit circuits is lacking.

Method: Using on-chip gate electrodes to generate local DC electric fields, the positions of TLS at the surface of a transmon qubit are determined by tuning TLS resonance frequencies and comparing coupling strengths to electric field simulations.

Result: Most detectable surface-TLS reside on the Josephson junction's leads, despite the coplanar capacitor's dominant role in electric field energy and surface area, indicating enhanced TLS density near shadow-evaporated electrodes made by lift-off techniques.

Conclusion: The method identifies critical regions in qubit circuits where TLS significantly contribute to decoherence, guiding improvements in qubit design and fabrication.

Abstract: The coherence of superconducting quantum computers is severely limited by
material defects that create parasitic two-level-systems (TLS). Progress is
complicated by lacking understanding how TLS are created and in which parts of
a qubit circuit they are most detrimental. Here, we present a method to
determine the individual positions of TLS at the surface of a transmon qubit.
We employ a set of on-chip gate electrodes near the qubit to generate local DC
electric fields that are used to tune the TLS' resonance frequencies. The TLS
position is inferred from the strengths at which TLS couple to different
electrodes and comparing them to electric field simulations. We found that the
majority of detectable surface-TLS was residing on the leads of the qubit's
Josephson junction, despite the dominant contribution of its coplanar capacitor
to electric field energy and surface area. This indicates that the TLS density
is significantly enhanced near shadow-evaporated electrodes fabricated by
lift-off techniques. Our method is useful to identify critical circuit regions
where TLS contribute most to decoherence, and can guide improvements in qubit
design and fabrication methods.

Motivation: To extend the foundational principle of uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics to thermodynamically conjugate variables in equilibrium states.

Method: The authors develop a framework based on an exact integral representation linking the quantum Fisher information to the autocorrelation function of the quantum operator.

Result: A tight upper bound for the quantum Fisher information is derived, leading to a thermodynamic uncertainty relation: Δθ‾ΔO ≥ k_B T.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a fundamental precision limit for quantum sensing and metrology in thermal systems by deriving a thermodynamic uncertainty relation, connecting it to thermodynamic properties of linear response and fluctuations.

Abstract: Uncertainty relations represent a foundational principle in quantum
mechanics, imposing inherent limits on the precision with which
\textit{mechanically} conjugate variables such as position and momentum can be
simultaneously determined. This work establishes analogous relations for
\textit{thermodynamically} conjugate variables -- specifically, a classical
intensive parameter $\theta$ and its corresponding extensive quantum operator
$\hat{O}$ -- in equilibrium states. We develop a framework to derive a rigorous
thermodynamic uncertainty relation for such pairs, where the uncertainty of the
classical parameter $\theta$ is quantified by its quantum Fisher information
$\mathcal{F}_\theta$. The framework is based on an exact integral
representation that relates $\mathcal{F}_{\theta}$ to the autocorrelation
function of operator $\hat{O}$. From this representation, we derive a tight
upper bound for the quantum Fisher information, which yields a thermodynamic
uncertainty relation: $\Delta\theta\,\overline{\Delta O} \ge k_\text{B}T$ with
$\overline{\Delta O}\equiv\partial_\theta\langle\hat{O}\rangle\,\Delta\theta$
and $T$ is the system temperature. The result establishes a fundamental
precision limit for quantum sensing and metrology in thermal systems, directly
connecting it to the thermodynamic properties of linear response and
fluctuations.

Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of neural network quantum states for Fermions with complex sign structures.

Method: Generalization of restricted Boltzmann machine to neuron product states (NPS) and analysis of feedforward neural network (FNN) and neural network backflow (NNBF) in second quantization.

Result: NPS can approximate any wavefunction under mild conditions; proofs for universal approximation of FNN and NNBF provided.

Conclusion: NPS, FNN, and NNBF demonstrate universal approximation capabilities for many-body wavefunctions in second quantization, offering new insights into neural network quantum states.

Abstract: Neural network quantum states emerge as a promising tool for solving quantum
many-body problems. However, its successes and limitations are still not
well-understood in particular for Fermions with complex sign structures. Based
on our recent work [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 21, 10252-10262 (2025)], we
generalizes the restricted Boltzmann machine to a more general class of states
for Fermions, formed by product of `neurons' and hence will be referred to as
neuron product states (NPS). NPS builds correlation in a very different way,
compared with the closely related correlator product states (CPS) [H. J.
Changlani, et al. Phys. Rev. B, 80, 245116 (2009)], which use full-rank local
correlators. In constrast, each correlator in NPS contains long-range
correlations across all the sites, with its representational power constrained
by the simple function form. We prove that products of such simple nonlocal
correlators can approximate any wavefunction arbitrarily well under certain
mild conditions on the form of activation functions. In addition, we also
provide elementary proofs for the universal approximation capabilities of
feedforward neural network (FNN) and neural network backflow (NNBF) in second
quantization. Together, these results provide a deeper insight into the neural
network representation of many-body wavefunctions in second quantization.

TL;DR: Quantum computing solves option-pricing efficiently by mapping PDEs to Hamiltonian simulation, offering polynomial and exponential speedups for single and high-dimensional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing is proposed to address computational challenges in option pricing due to non-linear payoffs, high dimensionality, and complex price dynamics.

Method: The framework maps the Kolmogorov forward partial differential equation to a Hamiltonian-simulation problem via the Schrödingerisation technique, specifying initial state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and efficient option price recovery via a swap test.

Result: The algorithm provides a polynomial advantage in grid size for single-dimension discretization and an exponential speedup for high-dimensional systems, overcoming the classical curse of dimensionality.

Conclusion: The end-to-end quantum algorithmic framework offers a potential route toward quantum advantage for challenging option-pricing tasks, especially for high-dimensional systems where it achieves an exponential speedup.

Abstract: The solution of option-pricing problems may turn out to be computationally
demanding due to non-linear and path-dependent payoffs, the high dimensionality
arising from multiple underlying assets, and sophisticated models of price
dynamics. In this context, quantum computing has been proposed as a means to
address these challenges efficiently. Prevailing approaches either simulate the
stochastic differential equations governing the forward dynamics of underlying
asset prices or directly solve the backward pricing partial differential
equation. Here, we present an end-to-end quantum algorithmic framework that
solves the Kolmogorov forward (Fokker-Planck) partial differential equation for
local-volatility models by mapping it to a Hamiltonian-simulation problem via
the Schr\"odingerisation technique. The algorithm specifies how to prepare the
initial quantum state, perform Hamiltonian simulation, and how to efficiently
recover the option price via a swap test. In particular, the efficiency of the
final solution recovery is an important advantage of solving the forward versus
the backward partial differential equation. Thus, our end-to-end framework
offers a potential route toward quantum advantage for challenging
option-pricing tasks. In particular, we obtain a polynomial advantage in grid
size for the discretization of a single dimension. Nevertheless, the true power
of our methodology lies in pricing high-dimensional systems, such as baskets of
options, because the quantum framework admits an exponential speedup with

*Wei Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper shows that fidelity between quantum states generates geometric quantities like quantum Fisher information, extends to classical cases, and applies to finite-temperature systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to generalize the concept of fidelity in quantum information geometry, connecting it to classical information geometry and exploring its implications for quantum systems described by real wave functions and finite-temperature scenarios.

Method: The methodology involves analyzing the fidelity between quantum states as a generating function for geometric quantities like quantum Fisher information and Berry curvature, with explicit calculations for 2×2 density matrices and the SSH model.

Result: Results include the fidelity as a generating function for quantum geometric quantities, explicit Bloch representation for 2×2 density matrices, and insights into the mitigation of quantum geometry at finite temperature in the SSH model.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the fidelity between two density matrices serves as a generating function for quantum Fisher information and Christoffel symbols, extending to classical Fisher information in the limit of real wave functions. The Bloch representation for 2×2 density matrices is explicitly given, and applications to the SSH model at finite temperature are explored.

Abstract: We elaborate that the fidelity between two density matrices is a generating
function, through which the quantum Fisher information matrix and Christoffel
symbol of the first kind in the parameter space can be obtained through
derivatives with respect to the parameters. For pure states, the fidelity and
phase of the product between two quantum states are shown to be the generating
functions of the quantum metric and Berry curvature, respectively. Further
limiting to systems described by real wave functions, our formalism recovers
the well-known result that the fidelity between two probability mass functions
is the generating function of the classical Fisher information matrix,
indicating a hierarchy of quantum to information geometry. The Bloch
representation of the generating functions is given explicitly for $2\times 2$
density matrices, and the application to canonical ensemble of
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model suggests the mitigation of quantum geometry at
finite temperature.

*Sumit Kumar Jana,Ryo Hanai,Tan Van Vu,Hisao Hayakawa,Archak Purkayastha*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a non-Markovian generalization of the Hatano-Nelson model in dissipative lattices, revealing unique nonreciprocal features in bosonic and fermionic systems, using non-equilibrium Green's functions without Markovian assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of assuming frequency-independent dissipation in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, especially in experimental settings where dissipation can be frequency-dependent, leading to non-Markovian behavior.

Method: The authors use non-equilibrium Green's functions to analyze the system without approximations like weak system-bath coupling or time-scale separation, which are typically required for Markovian treatments.

Result: The study finds frequency-dependent nonreciprocal hopping and uniform dissipation, along with unique non-Markovian features such as unidirectional frequency blocking in bosonic systems and a dissipative quantum phase transition in fermionic systems.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a non-Markovian generalization of the Hatano-Nelson model in a dissipative lattice, revealing unique nonreciprocal features in both bosonic and fermionic settings. These findings provide a foundation for future work on non-Markovian nonreciprocal quantum lattices.

Abstract: While considering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians arising in the presence of
dissipation, in most cases, the dissipation is taken to be frequency
independent. However, this idealization may not always be applicable in
experimental settings, where dissipation can be frequency-dependent. Such
frequency-dependent dissipation leads to non-Markovian behavior. In this work,
we demonstrate how a non-Markovian generalization of the Hatano-Nelson model, a
paradigmatic non-Hermitian system with nonreciprocal hopping, arises
microscopically in a quasi-one-dimensional dissipative lattice. This is
achieved using non-equilibrium Green's functions without requiring any
approximation like weak system-bath coupling or a time-scale separation, which
would have been necessary for a Markovian treatment. The resulting effective
system exhibits nonreciprocal hopping, as well as uniform dissipation, both of
which are frequency-dependent. This holds for both bosonic and fermionic
settings. We find solely non-Markovian nonreciprocal features like
unidirectional frequency blocking in bosonic setting, and a non-equilibrium
dissipative quantum phase transition in fermionic setting, that cannot be
captured in a Markovian theory, nor have any analog in reciprocal systems. Our
results lay the groundwork for describing and engineering non-Markovian
nonreciprocal quantum lattices.

*Jiayang Niu,Yan Wang,Jie Li,Ke Deng,Azadeh Alavi,Mark Sanderson,Yongli Ren*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: HyRLQAS uses hybrid-action reinforcement learning to design quantum circuits, outperforming existing methods in energy error and circuit efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing designs of quantum circuit architectures often lead to suboptimal performance. HyRLQAS aims to address this by unifying structure and parameter optimization.

Method: The framework couples discrete gate placement and continuous parameter generation within a hybrid action space, jointly learning circuit topology and initialization while refining previously placed gates through reinforcement learning.

Result: HyRLQAS achieves consistently lower energy errors and shorter circuits than discrete-only and continuous-only baselines. The hybrid action space leads to better circuit structures and favorable parameter initializations.

Conclusion: HyRLQAS proposes a hybrid-action reinforcement learning approach for quantum architecture search, achieving better circuit structures and parameter initializations. This method provides a principled pathway toward automated, hardware-efficient quantum circuit design.

Abstract: Designing expressive yet trainable quantum circuit architectures remains a
major challenge for variational quantum algorithms, where manual or heuristic
designs often lead to suboptimal performance. We propose HyRLQAS (Hybrid-Action
Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Architecture Search), a unified framework
that couples discrete gate placement and continuous parameter generation within
a hybrid action space. Unlike existing approaches that treat structure and
parameter optimization separately, HyRLQAS jointly learns circuit topology and
initialization while dynamically refining previously placed gates through a
reinforcement learning process. Trained in a variational quantum eigensolver
(VQE) environment, the agent constructs circuits that minimize molecular
ground-state energy. Experiments show that HyRLQAS achieves consistently lower
energy errors and shorter circuits than both discrete-only and continuous-only
baselines. Furthermore, the hybrid action space not only leads to better
circuit structures but also provides favorable parameter initializations,
resulting in post-optimization energy distributions with consistently lower
minima. These results suggest that hybrid action reinforcement learning
provides a principled pathway toward automated, hardware-efficient quantum
circuit design.

*Benedikt Tissot,Soubhadra Maiti,Emil R. Hellebek,Anders Søndberg Sørensen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper compares double-click and single-click methods for quantum entanglement, finding protocol choice depends on phase stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance entanglement generation between single trapped ions over long distances (hundreds of kilometers) by optimizing the interface between quantum processors and memories.

Method: The paper extends a previously introduced protocol for interfacing trapped-ion quantum processors with ensemble-based quantum memories. It compares double-click and single-click approaches, analyzing their respective advantages and limitations.

Result: The results show that the double-click approach relaxes phase stability requirements but is more sensitive to finite efficiencies. The optimal protocol depends on specific experimental conditions.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the choice between double-click and single-click approaches for ion edge nodes depends on the availability of phase stabilization and the efficiency of the ion-ensemble memory interface.

Abstract: In an accompanying paper [1], we introduced an approach to interface
trapped-ion quantum processors with ensemble-based quantum memories by matching
a spontaneous parametric down conversion source to both the ions and the
memories. This enables rapid entanglement generation between single trapped
ions separated by distances of hundreds of kilometers. In this article, we
extend the protocol and provide additional details of the analysis.
Particularly, we compare a double-click and single-click approaches for the ion
edge nodes. The double-click approach relaxes the phase stability requirement
but is strongly affected by finite efficiencies. Choosing the optimal protocol
thus depends on the access to the phase stabilization as well as the efficiency
of interface of the ions and ensemble-based memories.

*Jinghui Pi,Xingli Li,Yangqian Yan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Study reveals distinct quantum dynamics in trivial (single power-law decay) and nontrivial point-gap systems (dual scaling behavior), advancing understanding of dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the dynamical implications of point-gap topology in non-Hermitian topological phases, particularly focusing on the behavior of quantum particles in dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing.

Method: The study employs the saddle-point approximation method to analyze the evolution of quantum particles in dissipative systems with imaginary gap closing.

Result: Trivial point-gap systems exhibit a single power-law decay of the local Green's function, governed by saddle points. Nontrivial systems show a dual scaling behavior: exponential decay in the short-time regime (dominated by saddle points) and power-law decay in the long-time regime (controlled by imaginary gap-closing points).

Conclusion: Point-gap topology, characterized by spectral winding numbers, plays a crucial role in non-Hermitian topological phases and significantly influences real-time dynamics. The study identifies distinct dynamical behaviors in trivial and nontrivial point-gap systems, advancing the understanding of quantum dynamics in dissipative systems and offering testable experimental predictions.

Abstract: Point-gap topology, characterized by spectral winding numbers, is crucial to
non-Hermitian topological phases and dramatically alters real-time dynamics. In
this paper, we study the evolution of quantum particles in dissipative systems
with imaginary gap closing, using the saddle-point approximation method. For
trivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing points can also be saddle
points. This leads to a single power-law decay of the local Green's function,
with the asymptotic scaling behavior determined by the order of these saddle
points. In contrast, for nontrivial point-gap systems, imaginary gap-closing
points do not coincide with saddle points in general. This results in a
dynamical behavior characterized by two different scaling laws for distinct
time regimes. In the short-time regime, the local Green's function is governed
by the dominant saddle points and exhibits an asymptotic exponential decay. In
the long-time regime, however, the dynamics is controlled by imaginary
gap-closing points, leading to a power-law decay envelope. Our findings advance
the understanding of quantum dynamics in dissipative systems and provide
predictions testable in future experiments.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Gaussian channels in quantum steering, defining several classes and their conditions, and characterizes Gaussian unsteerable superchannels for quantifying steering capability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the foundational role of Gaussian channels in quantum protocols and the need to understand quantum steering as an intermediate resource between entanglement and Bell nonlocality.

Method: The authors derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for Gaussian channels to fall into specific classes related to quantum steering and explore their intrinsic relationships. They also characterize Gaussian unsteerable superchannels in detail.

Result: The paper presents the classification of Gaussian channels into steering-related classes, derives their conditions, and characterizes Gaussian unsteerable superchannels.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by summarizing the classification of Gaussian channels related to quantum steering and the derived necessary and sufficient conditions for each class, while also highlighting the importance of understanding Gaussian unsteerable superchannels for quantifying steering capability.

Abstract: Quantum steering is a crucial quantum resource that lies intermediate between
entanglement and Bell nonlocality. Gaussian channels, meanwhile, play a
foundational role in diverse quantum protocols, secure communication, and
related fields. In this paper, we focus on several classes of Gaussian channels
associated with quantum steering: Gaussian steering-annihilating channels,
Gaussian steering-breaking channels, Gaussian unsteerable channels, and maximal
Gaussian unsteerable channels. We give the concepts of these channels, derive
the necessary and sufficient conditions for a Gaussian channel to belong to
each class, and explore the intrinsic relationships among them. Additionally,
since quantifying the steering capability of Gaussian channels in
continuous-variable systems requires an understanding of the structure of free
superchannels, we also provide a detailed characterization of Gaussian
unsteerable superchannels and maximal Gaussian unsteerable superchannels.

TL;DR: A MIMO-based CV MDI-QKD system at THz frequencies enhances security by delegating measurements to an untrusted party, with optimized performance for different ranges through beamforming and efficient detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address practical vulnerabilities in MIMO THz CVQKD caused by detector imperfections by delegating measurements to an untrusted third party, Charlie, and enhancing system security.

Method: The study employs entanglement-based and prepare-and-measure protocols within a MIMO framework, using transmit-receive beamforming to mitigate path loss and enhance security.

Result: Simulations show that multiple antenna configurations and efficient homodyne detection optimize key rates, with lower THz frequencies performing better for long-range and higher frequencies for short-range applications.

Conclusion: The proposed CV MDI-QKD system, utilizing MIMO and beamforming techniques, offers a scalable and secure solution for quantum communications in next-generation wireless networks, with optimized performance across different THz frequencies.

Abstract: Although multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terahertz (THz)
continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD) is theoretically secure,
practical vulnerabilities may arise due to detector imperfections. This paper
explores a CV measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD system operating at THz
frequencies within a MIMO framework. In this system, measurement is delegated
to an untrusted third party, Charlie, rather than the receiver, eliminating all
detector attacks and significantly enhancing the system's practical security.
Using transmit-receive beamforming techniques, the system transforms MIMO
channels into multiple parallel lossy quantum channels, enabling robust key
distribution between Alice and Bob. This study examines entanglement-based and
prepare-and-measure protocols, deriving secret key rates for both asymptotic
and finite code scenarios. Simulations reveal the critical role of multiple
antenna configurations and efficient homodyne detection in mitigating
free-space path loss and maximizing key rates. Results indicate that system
performance is optimized at lower THz frequencies for long-range transmissions
and higher frequencies for short-range applications. The proposed protocol
offers a scalable solution for secure quantum communications in next-generation
wireless networks, demonstrating potential for deployment in both indoor and
outdoor environments.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A Floquet theory-based framework mitigates parasitic couplings in superconducting quantum circuits, enabling optimized parameter configurations for high-performance processors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parametric modulation in superconducting circuits induces parasitic couplings and frequency collisions, constraining processor performance.

Method: Develops a comprehensive numerical framework based on Floquet theory, integrating numerical analysis with newly derived analytical models for qubit-modulated and coupler-modulated schemes.

Result: Characterizes the complete map of parasitic sideband interactions and their error budgets, leading to a constraint-based optimization methodology to avoid detrimental interactions.

Conclusion: The work provides a predictive tool for co-engineering device parameters and control protocols, enabling systematic suppression of crosstalk and advancing large-scale, high-performance quantum processors.

Abstract: Superconducting circuits are a leading platform for scalable quantum
computing, where parametric modulation is a widely used technique for
implementing high-fidelity multi-qubit operations. A critical challenge,
however, is that this modulation can induce a dense landscape of parasitic
couplings, leading to detrimental frequency collisions that constrain processor
performance. In this work, we develop a comprehensive numerical framework,
grounded in Floquet theory, to systematically analyze and mitigate these
collisions. Our approach integrates this numerical analysis with newly derived
analytical models for both qubit-modulated and coupler-modulated schemes,
allowing us to characterize the complete map of parasitic sideband interactions
and their distinct error budgets. This analysis forms the basis of a
constraint-based optimization methodology designed to identify parameter
configurations that satisfy the derived physical constraints, thereby avoiding
detrimental parasitic interactions. We illustrate the utility of this framework
with applications to analog quantum simulation and gate design. Our work
provides a predictive tool for co-engineering device parameters and control
protocols, enabling the systematic suppression of crosstalk and paving the way
for large-scale, high-performance quantum processors.

### [39] [Channel Superposition Mitigates Photon Loss Errors in Quantum Illumination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05125)
*Fei Li,Xiao-Wei Li,Oscar Dahlsten*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Channel superposition protocols (ICO and PS-DE) enhance quantum illumination performance, with ICO providing superior robustness against photon loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of photon loss in quantum illumination protocols by exploring channel superposition techniques.

Method: The study employs a channel superposition framework, including indefinite causal order (ICO) and path superposition with disjoint environment (PS-DE), analyzed using the quantum Chernoff bound.

Result: Both ICO and PS-DE can achieve an advantage in detection performance, with ICO being significantly more robust due to stronger quantum interference.

Conclusion: The ICO protocol is more robust and offers a tighter upper bound on error probability compared to standard quantum illumination and PS-DE, due to its exploitation of a shared environment for stronger quantum interference.

Abstract: In quantum illumination, the probe photon is entangled with an ancilla
photon, and both are jointly measured at the end. The entanglement between the
probe and ancilla photons enhances the detection performance per unit average
photon number in the probe mode, particularly in low-reflectivity and
high-noise scenarios. However, photon loss severely limits the practical
advantage of such protocols. To address this, we employ a channel superposition
framework, which encompasses two kinds of channel superposition protocols:
indefinite causal order (ICO) and path superposition with disjoint environment
(PS-DE). Our analytical and numerical analysis based on the quantum Chernoff
bound shows that both ICO and PS-DE can, in principle, achieve an advantage.
The advantage persists as long as non-zero interference remains, reverting to
the performance of standard quantum illumination once the interference is
completely suppressed. Crucially, the ICO protocol is significantly more
robust, maintaining a tighter upper bound on the error probability than
standard quantum illumination and the PS-DE approach. This performance
hierarchy is rooted in their fundamental structures: ICO exploits a shared
environment to generate stronger quantum interference, while PS-DE, relying on
disjoint environments, offers a more experimentally tractable albeit less
potent alternative.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Improved quantum teleportation protocol using weak measurements and flip-reversal operations to boost fidelity in noisy environments, showing superior performance in bit flip noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance fidelity in quantum teleportation protocols under noisy conditions by improving existing WM-flip-reversal frameworks.

Method: Combines weak measurements (WMs) with flip and reversal operations in a four-qubit entangled system, applying WM and flip before transmission and reversal operations after to mitigate noise effects.

Result: The proposed WMR protocol outperforms the WM-flip-reversal method across three noise models (ADC, PFC, BFC), with notable improvements in fidelity and robustness, particularly for bit flip noise.

Conclusion: The modified WMR scheme achieves higher teleportation fidelity and robustness, especially in bit flip noise environments, demonstrating the potential of optimized weak measurement strategies for reliable quantum communication.

Abstract: This study presents an improved quantum teleportation protocol designed to
enhance fidelity in noisy environments by combining weak measurements (WMs)
with flip and reversal operations. In our scheme, Alice prepares a four-qubit
entangled state and shares one of the entangled qubits with Bob, which serves
as the quantum channel for teleporting an arbitrary single-qubit state. Since
the communication channel is subject to noise, Alice performs a weak
measurement on the shared qubit before transmission to reduce the impact of
decoherence. Building upon existing WM-flip-reversal frameworks, we propose a
modified weak measurement and reversal (WMR) protocol tailored for different
noises in a four-qubit entangled system. The approach applies WM and flip
operations prior to transmission to enhance resilience against noise, followed
by corresponding reversal operations after transmission to recover the original
quantum state. We systematically compare the performance of our proposed WMR
protocol with the previously proposed WM-flip-reversal method under three
common noise models: amplitude damping channel (ADC), phase flip channel (PFC),
and bit flip channel (BFC). Our analysis reveals that the modified WMR scheme
achieves significantly higher teleportation fidelity and improved robustness,
particularly in bit flip noise environments. These findings highlight the
potential of optimized weak measurement strategies for developing more reliable
and noise-tolerant quantum communication protocols.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed scheme reliably and robustly creates arbitrary coherent superpositions of metastable states by adjusting laser pulse parameters, as confirmed by dressed state analysis and numerical simulations.

Abstract: We present a novel scheme for coherent manipulation of populations and robust
creation of arbitrary coherent superposition of metastable states of a quantum
system with lambda configuration of operating energy levels using laser pulses
with a quadratically chirped carrier frequency. The case of a single broadband
laser pulse is considered, when the frequency spectrum of the pulse exceeds the
frequency distance between the metastable energy levels of the system. The
results of the dressed state analysis and numerical simulation are presented,
demonstrating reliable and robust creation of an arbitrary coherent
superposition of metastable states by changing the parameters of laser pulses.

Motivation: To enhance secret key exchange in MIMO wireless systems over FSO channels by leveraging quantum key distribution protocols, addressing eavesdropping risks and performance trade-offs.

Method: The paper employs weak coherent pulses and decoy states, analyzes photon-number-splitting attacks, and uses threshold detection for key extraction. Novel expressions for secret key rate and quantum bit error rate are derived and numerically evaluated.

Result: The study shows performance gains with larger MIMO configurations and explores the trade-off between one- and two-way protocols with respect to FSO link transmission distance.

Conclusion: The paper presents novel frameworks for one- and two-way DV-QKD protocols in MIMO wireless systems, deriving key performance metrics and assessing trade-offs between protocol types and transmission distance.

Abstract: This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system
wherein two legitimate users attempt to exchange secret keys over free-space
optical (FSO) channels. Novel frameworks for the use of the one- and two-way
discrete-variable quantum key distribution (DV-QKD) protocols, employing weak
coherent pulses and decoy states, are presented. Focusing on the case where a
photon-number-splitting attack is adopted by the eavesdropper and the
legitimate multi-antenna receiver using threshold detection for the key
extraction, novel expressions for the secret key rate and quantum bit error
rate for both one- and two-way protocols are derived. The performance gain with
larger MIMO configurations and the tradeoff between the performances with the
one- and the two-way protocols with respect to the transmission distance of the
legitimate FSO link are numerically assessed.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Researchers improved satellite-based QKD by optimizing information reconciliation, boosting secure key generation by 3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite-based QKD links are essential for long-distance secure communication but are limited by short durations and low key generation rates. The study aims to maximize secure key generation by improving the information reconciliation process under these constraints.

Method: The researchers built an accurate model of the downlink signal and QBER during a complete satellite pass, accounting for varying link geometry, scintillation effects, and signal intensities in the Decoy-State protocol. They then optimized the information reconciliation step using this model.

Result: The optimized information reconciliation process achieved a 3% increase in secure key generation for realistic satellite-based QKD scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that leveraging a-priori information on the instantaneous QBER can significantly improve the efficiency of information reconciliation in the Decoy-State BB84 protocol, resulting in a nearly 3% increase in secure key generation for realistic satellite-based QKD scenarios.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic solution that leverages the
properties of quantum mechanics to be resistant and secure even against an
attacker with unlimited computational power. Satellite-based links are
important in QKD because they can reach distances that the best fiber systems
cannot. However, links between satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and ground
stations have a duration of only a few minutes, resulting in the generation of
a small amount of secure keys. In this context, we investigate the optimization
of the information reconciliation step of the QKD post-processing in order to
generate as much secure key as possible. As a first step, we build an accurate
model of the downlink signal and quantum bit error rate (QBER) during a
complete satellite pass, which are time-varying due to three effects: (i) the
varying link geometry over time, (ii) the scintillation effect, and (iii) the
different signal intensities adopted in the Decoy-State protocol. Leveraging
the a-priori information on the instantaneous QBER, we improve the efficiency
of information reconciliation (IR) (i.e., the error correction phase) in the
Decoy-State BB84 protocol, resulting in a secure key that is almost 3\% longer
for realistic scenarios.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates well-defined wavepacket dynamics for a relativistic particle in an infinite well, providing insights into revival times and quantum carpets across different dynamical regimes.

Abstract: We investigate wavepacket dynamics for a relativistic particle in a box
evolving according to the relativistic Schr\"odinger (also known as the
Salpeter) equation. We derive the solutions for an infinite well -- which
contrary to the standard relativistic wave equations (such as the Klein-Gordon
or Dirac equations) -- are well defined, and use these solutions to construct
wavepackets. We obtain expressions for the wavepacket revival times and explore
the corresponding quantum carpets (the space-time probability density plots)
for different dynamical regimes. We further analyze level spacing statistics as
the dynamics goes from the non-relativistic regime to the ultra-relativistic
limit.

Conclusion: The paper introduces CUNQA, an innovative open-source DQC emulator for HPC environments, which successfully emulates three DQC models and demonstrates their functionality using the QPE algorithm. It fills a gap by being the first tool to address DQC emulation in HPC settings.

Abstract: The challenge of scaling quantum computers to gain computational power is
expected to lead to architectures with multiple connected quantum processing

### [46] [Revocation and Reconstruction of Shared Quantum States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05212)
*Prakash Mudholkar,Chiranjeevi Vanarasa,Indranil Chakrabarty,Srinathan Kannan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A protocol for quantum state revocation using a four-qubit entangled resource is proposed, enabling the dealer to reclaim the state before reconstruction under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of revoking a quantum state after it has been shared, particularly in scenarios where the dealer is uncertain about the intentions of the reconstructors or when dishonest shareholders collude.

Method: The authors propose a sharing and revocation protocol using a four-qubit entangled resource shared among three parties (two qubits with the dealer and one each with the shareholders). The protocol relies on the classical outcomes from the sharing phase and additional quantum resources to enable revocation.

Result: The protocol is shown to be successful with a specific class of four-qubit pure entangled states, with the range of parameters for success explicitly identified.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that quantum state revocation is feasible using a four-qubit entangled resource, providing the dealer with additional control to prevent collusion by dishonest shareholders. The protocol's success depends on specific parameters of the entangled states used.

Abstract: The problem of revocation of quantum states after sharing is interesting and
we ask: Is it possible for a dealer to revoke the state once shared, before the
reconstruction process? Additional resources like bell states are used to help
the dealer to get back the state. In a three-party scenario, we show an
independent way to revoke, if, for any reason, the dealer is not sure about the
intention of the/any reconstructor. In general, the classical outcomes of the
dealer in sharing phase are needed, to be able to reconstruct the state
perfectly. When both the shareholders are dishonest, and without the dealer's
knowledge, collude to reconstruct, they always have some chance of succeeding.
This is addressed by giving more control to the dealer by making him/her) to
have a quantum share as well. We give a sharing and revocation protocol with a
four-qubit entangled resource shared among three parties (two qubits with the
dealer and one each with the shareholders). We further consider a class of four
qubit pure entangled states as resource and explicitly find the range of
parameters for which the protocol will be successful.

### [47] [Adaptive Entanglement-Aware Routing for Satellite Quantum Networks under Orbital and Atmospheric Variability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05228)
*Dhrumil Bhatt,Vidushi Kumar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new adaptive routing framework for satellite quantum networks improves key generation and fidelity by accounting for orbital dynamics and atmospheric conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current routing mechanisms fail to account for dynamic orbital and atmospheric conditions, leading to inefficiencies in satellite-based quantum networks.

Method: An adaptive entanglement-aware routing framework that integrates orbital geometry, atmospheric attenuation, and multi-parameter link evaluation, with routing metrics based on fidelity, trust, and key-rate weights.

Result: Monte Carlo simulations show a 275% improvement in key generation rate and a 15% increase in effective entanglement fidelity over existing methods, with sub-linear path-length scaling and robustness to fading variances.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential for future global quantum constellations due to its robustness and scalability.

Abstract: The expansion of satellite-based quantum networks requires adaptive routing
mechanisms that can sustain entanglement under dynamic orbital and atmospheric
conditions. Conventional schemes, often tailored to static or idealised
topologies, fail to capture the combined effects of orbital motion, fading, and
trust variability in inter-satellite links. This work proposes an
\textit{adaptive entanglement-aware routing framework} that jointly accounts
for orbital geometry, atmospheric attenuation, and multi-parameter link
evaluation. The routing metric integrates fidelity, trust, and key-rate weights
to maintain connectivity and mitigate loss from turbulence and fading. Monte
Carlo simulations across multiple orbital densities ($\rho =
10^{-6}$~km$^{-3}$) and environmental regimes, standard atmosphere, strong
turbulence, and clear-sky LEO show up to a 275\% improvement in key generation
rate and a 15\% increase in effective entanglement fidelity over existing
adaptive methods. The framework achieves sub-linear path-length scaling with
network size and remains robust for fading variances up to
$\sigma_{\mathrm{fade}}=0.1$, demonstrating strong potential for future global
quantum constellations.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A triple-hybrid quantum support vector machine combines quantum and classical methods, showing higher precision and faster convergence on complex quantum data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum machine learning has potential advantages over classical methods, but current quantum computers' limited size restricts their full potential. Combining quantum and classical computing paradigms can optimize task distribution and algorithm performance.

Method: A gate-based quantum model is used to implement a quantum kernel and a complex feature map. A quadratic unconstrained optimization problem is formulated for quantum annealing hardware, with losses evaluated on classical hardware and model parameters reconfigured accordingly.

Result: The triple-hybrid quantum support vector machine achieves higher precision on complex quantum data and varies in performance on simple classical data with limited training. It also converges faster on complex data, requiring fewer circuit evaluations.

Conclusion: The triple-hybrid quantum support vector machine demonstrates higher precision and faster convergence on complex quantum data compared to other quantum and classical methods, while performance varies on simple classical data with limited training.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning is one of the fields where quantum computers are
expected to bring advantages over classical methods. However, the limited size
of current computers restricts the exploitation of the full potential of
quantum machine learning methods. Additionally, different computing paradigms,
both quantum and classical, each have their own strengths and weaknesses.
Obtaining optimal results with algorithms thus requires algorithms to be
tweaked to the underlying computational paradigm, and the tasks to be optimally
distributed over the available computational resources. In this work, we
explore the potential gains from combining different computing paradigms to
solve the complex task of data classification for three different datasets. We
use a gate-based quantum model to implement a quantum kernel and implement a
complex feature map. Next, we formulate a quadratic unconstrained optimisation
problem to be solved on quantum annealing hardware. We then evaluate the losses
on classical hardware and reconfigure the model parameters accordingly. We
tested this so-called triple-hybrid quantum support vector machine on various
data sets, and find that it achieves higher precision than other support vector
machines (both quantum and classical) on complex quantum data, whereas it
achieves varying performance on simple classical data using limited training.
For the complex data sets, the triple-hybrid version converges faster,
requiring fewer circuit evaluations.

*Leandro C. Souza,Laurent E. Dardenne,Renato Portugal*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A gate-based Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) enhances global optimization by utilizing superposition and entanglement, improving convergence and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to propose a gate-based Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) for real-valued global optimization, leveraging quantum resources like superposition and entanglement to improve convergence and robustness.

Method: The method involves representing individuals as quantum circuits with measurement outcomes decoded into real-valued vectors. Evolutionary operators act on circuit structures, and fitness is evaluated through quantum sampling.

Result: The results show that superposition (via Hadamard gates) consistently improves convergence, and introducing pairwise inter-individual entanglement accelerates early convergence.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that both superposition and entanglement enhance the search dynamics of evolutionary quantum algorithms, establishing gate-based QGAs as a promising framework for quantum-enhanced global optimization.

Abstract: We propose a gate-based Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) for real-valued
global optimization. In this model, individuals are represented by quantum
circuits whose measurement outcomes are decoded into real-valued vectors
through binary discretization. Evolutionary operators act directly on circuit
structures, allowing mutation and crossover to explore the space of gate-based
encodings. Both fixed-depth and variable-depth variants are introduced,
enabling either uniform circuit complexity or adaptive structural evolution.
Fitness is evaluated through quantum sampling, using the mean decoded output of
measurement outcomes as the argument of the objective function. To isolate the
impact of quantum resources, we compare gate sets with and without the Hadamard
gate, showing that superposition consistently improves convergence and
robustness across benchmark functions such as the Rastrigin function.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing pairwise inter-individual
entanglement in the population accelerates early convergence, revealing that
quantum correlations among individuals provide an additional optimization
advantage. Together, these results show that both superposition and
entanglement enhance the search dynamics of evolutionary quantum algorithms,
establishing gate-based QGAs as a promising framework for quantum-enhanced
global optimization.

TL;DR: The semi-classical quantization of the Euler-Bernoulli beam reveals Casimir-like effects and identifies decoherence-free subspaces from degenerate states under specific boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the semi-classical quantization of the Euler-Bernoulli beam model and uncover its similarities to known quantum effects like the Casimir effect, as well as to investigate degenerate states and their implications for decoherence.

Method: The semi-classical quantization of the Euler-Bernoulli beam model is performed analogously to the quantization of the electromagnetic field, leading to the identification of effects similar to the photonic Casimir effect.

Result: The study finds that the Casimir force per unit area is proportional to the first mode energy divided by the beam's volume, with degenerate states forming decoherence-free subspaces for hinged-hinged boundary conditions and quasi-degenerate states showing lower decoherence rates for other boundary conditions.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the Euler-Bernoulli beam model, when quantized semi-classically, exhibits effects similar to the Casimir effect, with degenerate states forming decoherence-free subspaces for certain boundary conditions.

Abstract: The Euler-Bernoulli beam model has been studied classically and
semi-classically. The semi-classical quantization is done in an analogous way
to the quantization of the electromagnetic field, and we found an effect that
is similar to the Casimir effect, which is the photonic Casimir effect. The
Casimir force, by unit area, is proportional to the first mode energy divided
by the volume of the beam. For the hinged-hinged boundary condition, degenerate
states were found. These degenerate pairs form decoherence-free subspaces for
dispersive thermal reservoirs. For other boundary conditions, there are also
subspaces with lower decoherence rates, which occur for quasi-degenerate
states.

TL;DR: Shallow IQP circuits effectively model graph features, with local accuracy but some global limitations, as demonstrated by experiments on quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the expressivity and robustness of shallow IQP circuits as generative graph models, particularly for bipartite and Erdős-Rényi distributions.

Method: Utilizing edge-qubit encoding to map graphs onto quantum states, with simulations and large-scale experiments on IBM's Aachen QPU.

Result: Local statistics remain accurate across scales, while global properties degrade at larger system sizes. Spectral bipartivity shows robustness at higher qubit counts.

Conclusion: Shallow IQP circuits can learn and reproduce meaningful structural patterns in graph data, providing practical baselines for quantum generative modeling in the NISQ era.

Abstract: We introduce shallow instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) circuits as
generative graph models, using an edge-qubit encoding to map graphs onto
quantum states. Focusing on bipartite and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi distributions, we
study their expressivity and robustness through simulations and large-scale
experiments. Noiseless simulations of $28$ qubits ($8$-node graphs) reveal that
shallow IQP models can learn key structural features, such as the edge density
and bipartite partitioning. On IBM's Aachen QPU, we scale experiments from $28$
to $153$ qubits ($8$-$18$ nodes) in order to characterize performance on real
quantum hardware. Local statistics, such as the degree distributions, remain
accurate across scales with total variation distances ranging from $0.04$ to
$0.20$, while global properties like strict bipartiteness degrade at the
largest system sizes ($91$ and $153$ qubits). Notably, spectral bipartivity, a
relaxation of strict bipartiteness, remains comparatively robust at higher
qubit counts. These results establish practical baselines for the performance
of shallow IQP circuits on current quantum hardware and demonstrate that, even
without error mitigation, such circuits can learn and reproduce meaningful
structural patterns in graph data, guiding future developments in quantum
generative modeling for the NISQ era and beyond.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to surpass the fidelity of theoretical quantum circuits in noisy environments and explore the potential of VQAs as an error-mitigation strategy, especially in scenarios where coherent noise significantly impacts performance.

Method: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are used to simulate quantum algorithms under realistic noise conditions, specifically the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) for two qubits under coherent and incoherent noise. Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) are introduced during optimization to enhance generalization.

Result: The variational circuit successfully reproduces the QFT with higher fidelity under coherent noise, demonstrating its effectiveness as an error-mitigation strategy.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that variational quantum algorithms can effectively mitigate noise, particularly coherent noise, and improve fidelity in small- to medium-scale quantum systems. The method's adaptability to device-specific noise profiles offers a practical approach for enhancing quantum algorithm reliability in near-term hardware.

Abstract: We propose using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) to simulate
established quantum algorithms under realistic noise conditions, aiming to
surpass the fidelity of theoretical circuits in noisy environments. Focusing on
the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), we perform numerical simulations for two
qubits under both coherent and incoherent noise. To enhance generalization, we
further introduce the use of Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) during the
optimization. Our results show that the variational circuit can reproduce the
QFT with higher fidelity in scenarios dominated by coherent noise. This
demonstrates the potential of the approach as an effective error-mitigation
strategy for small- to medium-scale quantum systems, particularly in settings
where coherent noise strongly impacts performance. Beyond mitigating noise and
improving fidelity, the method can be adapted to the noise profile of a
specific device, providing a versatile and practical route to enhance the
reliability of quantum algorithms in near-term quantum hardware.

Method: 提出了一种结合量子-经典映射方法与Lindblad主方程的耗散量子动力学的方法。该方法基于经典轨迹与量子子系统的动力学耦合，但采用从Redfield理论导出的随机量子轨迹来演化子系统，而非时间依赖的薛定谔方程。

Conclusion: 该方法在自旋玻色子模型和腔增强荧光系统中与传统全量子力学基准表现出优秀的吻合度，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We propose a method which combines the quantum-classical mapping approach to
surface hopping (MASH) with the dissipative quantum dynamics of the Lindblad
master equation. Like conventional surface-hopping methods, our approach is
based on classical trajectories coupled to the dynamics of a quantum subsystem.
However, instead of evolving the subsystem wavefunction according to the
time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, we use stochastic quantum trajectories
derived from secular Redfield theory. This enables the simulation of open
quantum systems coupled simultaneously to Markovian quantum baths and
anharmonic non-Markovian classical degrees of freedom. Applications to the
spin-boson model and to the cavity-enhanced fluorescence of an electronically
nonadiabatic molecule show excellent agreement with fully quantum-mechanical
benchmarks.

Method: Measurements of the absorption spectrum, inhomogeneous broadening, lifetimes of excited states, spectral hole-burning spectra, and optical free induction decays (FIDs) under varying magnetic fields.

Result: The maximum optical coherence time of 1.1 μs was observed under a 2T magnetic field.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the coherence of an excited-state transition in a rare-earth crystal, suggesting potential applications in quantum technology.

Abstract: We characterize the spectroscopic and coherence properties of the 1451.37 nm

measure the absorption spectrum between the $^{3}H_{6}$ - $^{3}F_{4}$ and
$^{3}F_{4}$ - $^{3}H_{4}$ manifolds, the inhomogeneous broadening of the
$^{3}F_{4}$ - $^{3}H_{4}$ (excited-state) ZPL, and the lifetimes of the
higher-lying and lower-lying excited states. We also investigate spectral
hole-burning spectra with varying magnetic fields, which provides insight into
hyperfine and superhyperfine interactions. Using again spectral holes but also
optical free induction decays (FIDs), we assess optical coherence times,
finding a maximum of 1.1 $\mu s$ when a 2T magnetic field is applied. Our
results -- the first to demonstrate coherence of an excited-state transition in
a rare-earth crystal -- suggest the possibility of exploiting such transitions

Conclusion: 结论: 自适应方法在某些特定条件下比非自适应方法更有效，优势可达近2倍，且自适应算法的优势存在上限。

Abstract: Quantum phase estimation is one of the most important tools in quantum
algorithms. It can be made non-adaptive (meaning all applications of the
unitary $U_\phi$ happen simultaneously) without using more applications of
$U_\phi$, albeit at the expense of using many more qubits. It is also known
that there is no advantage for adaptive algorithms in the case where the phase
that needs to be estimated is arbitrary or is uniformly random. Here we give
examples of a special case of phase estimation, with a promise on the values
that the unknown phase can take, where adaptive methods are provably better
than non-adaptive methods by a factor of nearly 2 in the number of uses of
$U_\phi$. We also prove some upper bounds on the maximum advantage that
adaptive algorithms for phase estimation can achieve over non-adaptive ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited control over non-radiative processes in solid-state quantum emitters using conventional methods.

Method: Combination of opto-magnetic spectroscopy and a theoretical model to quantify strain-induced mixing of excited states and alteration of intersystem crossing.

Result: Giant shear strain gradients under high pressure trigger a complete reversal of intrinsic spin polarization, with sub-diffraction-limit spatial control.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that anisotropic lattice strain is a powerful tool for manipulating spin dynamics in solid-state systems, enabling reprogramming of spin polarization and opening avenues for advanced quantum technologies.

Abstract: The ability to control solid-state quantum emitters is fundamental to
advancing quantum technologies. The performance of these systems is
fundamentally governed by their spin-dependent photodynamics, yet conventional
control methods using cavities offer limited access to key non-radiative
processes. Here we demonstrate that anisotropic lattice strain serves as a
powerful tool for manipulating spin dynamics in solid-state systems. Under high
pressure, giant shear strain gradients trigger a complete reversal of the
intrinsic spin polarization, redirecting ground-state population from
$|0\rangle$ to $|\pm 1\rangle$ manifold. We show that this reprogramming arises
from strain-induced mixing of the NV center's excited states and dramatic
alteration of intersystem crossing, which we quantify through a combination of
opto-magnetic spectroscopy and a theoretical model that disentangles
symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking strain contributions. Furthermore,
the polarization reversal is spatially mapped with a transition region below
120 nm, illustrating sub-diffraction-limit control. Our work establishes strain
engineering as a powerful tool for tailoring quantum emitter properties,
opening avenues for programmable quantum light sources, high-density spin-based
memory, and hybrid quantum photonic devices.

Abstract: Quantum computers hold the promise of outperforming classical computers in
solving certain problems. While large-scale quantum algorithms will require
fault-tolerant devices, near-term demonstrations of quantum advantage on
existing devices can provide important milestones. Random circuit sampling has
emerged as a leading candidate for such demonstrations. However, existing
implementations often underutilize circuit depth, limiting the achievable
advantage. We introduce a holographic random circuit sampling algorithm that
substantially increases the sampling complexity by leveraging repeated
interactions and mid-circuit measurements. This approach scales the effective
sampling dimension with the circuit depth, ultimately leading to an exponential
growth in sampling complexity. With merely 20 physical qubits on IBM quantum
devices, we experimentally demonstrate the effective sampling of up to 200
qubits, with a cross-entropy benchmark fidelity of $0.0593$, establishing a new
route to scalable quantum advantage through the combined use of spatial and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scalability challenge in quantum devices, exploring modular architectures that connect multiple QPUs efficiently without high-loss interconnects.

Method: A classical linkage scheme was introduced to merge multiple independent quantum processing units (QPUs) into a single logical device, enabling thread-level parallelism (TLP). Theoretical analysis and experimental validation were conducted using NMR quantum nodes.

Result: A 4-qubit GHZ state was partitioned into parallel 2-qubit subcircuits with 93.8% fidelity. Non-Hermitian evolution was accurately implemented.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that classical linkages can effectively scale up quantum computations and realize non-unitary channels, offering a practical route for software-defined, clustered quantum accelerators.

Abstract: Scaling up quantum devices is a central challenge for realizing practical
quantum computation. Modular quantum architectures promise scalability, yet
experiments to date have relied on either $\sim\!10^{3}$-qubit monolithic chips
or fragile interconnects with high loss. Here, we introduce a classical linkage
scheme that merges multiple independent quantum processing units (QPUs) into a
single logical device, enabling thread-level parallelism (TLP). Theoretically,
we show that quantum routines with product-state inputs and low-rank entangling
layers can be re-expressed in an efficient parallelizable form. Experimentally,
we validate this architecture on clusters comprising up to sixteen benchtop
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum nodes. A four-qubit
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is partitioned into parallel two-qubit
subcircuits, achieving a fidelity of $93.8\,\%$ with respect to the ideal
state. A non-Hermitian evolution, implemented via a truncated Cauchy integral
on Hermitian Hamiltonians, reproduces exact observables with high accuracy. Our
results demonstrate that classical links suffice to scale up the logical size
of quantum computations and realize general, non-unitary channels on today's
hardware, opening an experimentally accessible route toward software-defined,
clustered quantum accelerators.

Motivation: The motivation is to enhance the sustainability of quantum technologies by analyzing the relationship between complexity and energy cost in quantum procedures.

Method: The study introduces a sequential quantum phase estimation protocol where a phase is encoded in a quantum channel. The channel is applied repeatedly to a probe state until measurement, and the trade-off between implementation energy and channel application frequency (complexity) is analyzed.

Result: A trade-off relation between the implementation energy of the quantum channel and the number of its applications is established, ensuring desired estimation precision.

Conclusion: The framework established in this paper provides a method to optimize the energy consumption of quantum protocols by balancing complexity and energy cost, with potential applications in other quantum technologies.

Abstract: Driven by the desire to make quantum technologies more sustainable, in this
work we introduce a framework for analysing the interplay between complexity
and energy cost of quantum procedures. In particular, we study a sequential
quantum phase estimation protocol, where a phase of physical significance is
encoded in a quantum channel. The channel is applied to a probe state
repetitively until the probe is measured and the outcome leads to an estimate
on the phase. We establish a trade-off relation between the implementation
energy of the channel and the number of times it is applied (complexity), while
reaching a desired estimation precision. The principles of our analysis can be
adapted to optimise the energy consumption in other quantum protocols and
devices.

TL;DR: Quantinuum Helios: a high-fidelity 98-qubit trapped-ion quantum processor surpassing classical simulation limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance quantum computing by improving fidelity and complexity beyond current classical simulation limits.

Method: Utilizes a 98-qubit trapped-ion quantum processor with a QCCD architecture, featuring ¹³⁷Ba⁺ hyperfine qubits, all-to-all connectivity, and parallelized operations.

Result: Achieves low infidelities for single-qubit gates (2.5×10⁻⁵), two-qubit gates (7.9×10⁻⁴), and state preparation and measurement (4.8×10⁻⁴). Demonstrates system-level performance in random Clifford circuits and circuit sampling.

Conclusion: Helios demonstrates superior performance in quantum computing, operating beyond classical simulation capabilities.

Abstract: We report on Quantinuum Helios, a 98-qubit trapped-ion quantum processor
based on the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture. Helios features
$^{137}$Ba$^{+}$ hyperfine qubits, all-to-all connectivity enabled by a
rotatable ion storage ring connecting two quantum operation regions by a
junction, speed improvements from parallelized operations, and a new software
stack with real-time compilation of dynamic programs. Averaged over all
operational zones in the system, we achieve average infidelities of
$2.5(1)\times10^{-5}$ for single-qubit gates, $7.9(2)\times10^{-4}$ for
two-qubit gates, and $4.8(6)\times10^{-4}$ for state preparation and
measurement, none of which are fundamentally limited and likely able to be
improved. These component infidelities are predictive of system-level
performance in both random Clifford circuits and random circuit sampling, the
latter demonstrating that Helios operates well beyond the reach of classical
simulation and establishes a new frontier of fidelity and complexity for
quantum computers.

Motivation: 研究CSS保持稳定器电路的模拟问题，旨在通过理论结构改进现有算法，减少计算开销，尤其是在容错计算中。

Result: 成功将CSS保持稳定器的电路重写为经典概率电路，提出了新的理论框架，证明了计算开销的减少和上下文资源的作用。

Conclusion: 该论文为模拟CSS保持稳定器的电路提供了一种新的理论框架，通过经典概率电路的精确重写和参考帧的动态修改，展示了计算开销的减少和上下文资源的利用。

Abstract: Simulation of stabilizer circuits is a well-studied problem in quantum
information processing, with a number of highly optimized algorithms available.
Yet, we argue that further improvements can arise from the theoretical
structure of stabilizer operations themselves. We focus on the subclass of
stabilizer circuits composed of Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)-preserving
stabilizer operations, which naturally appear in fault-tolerant computations
over CSS stabilizer codes. Using elementary circuit-transformation techniques,
we show that such circuits can be exactly rewritten as classical probabilistic
circuits that reproduce measurement statistics. This rewriting introduces no
computational overhead, in contrast to the general case of stabilizer circuits.
To clarify the origin of this simplification, we introduce the standard
quadratic-form representation of general stabilizer operations (Clifford
channels). It provides an efficient way to describe compositions of stabilizer
operations and thus to simulate stabilizer circuits. CSS-preserving operations
correspond to purely linear forms, which under a Walsh-Hadamard-Fourier
transform yield a noncontextual hidden variable model, providing an alternative
proof of the introduced rewriting. Finally, we develop a theory of reference
frames for multiqubit systems, where frames are encoded by quadratic forms.
This allows us to express stabilizer operations as probabilistic maps for
proper reference frames. Non-CSS-preserving stabilizer circuits require
dynamical modifications of reference frames, embodying a contextuality resource
that leads to the computational overhead. This framework provides a new
perspective on simulating stabilizer and near-stabilizer circuits within
dynamically evolving quasiprobability models.

Motivation: To address the underdeveloped protocols for supporting algorithms and non-all-to-all qubit-connected hardware by tackling the challenges of cutting compact controlled unitary gates and hardware topology.

Method: Developed shardQ, leveraging the SparseCut algorithm with MPS compilation and a global knitting technique to partition and recombine quantum circuits.

Result: ShardQ elucidates the optimal trade-off between computational time and error rate, validated by ablation analysis using an IBM Marrakesh QPU.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of shardQ in optimizing the trade-off between computational time and error rate for quantum encoding, with practical validation on an IBM Marrakesh QPU.

Abstract: Quantum computing enables faster computations than clas-sical algorithms
through superposition and entanglement. Circuit cutting and knitting are
effective techniques for ame-liorating current noisy quantum processing unit
(QPUs) er-rors via a divide-and-conquer approach that splits quantum circuits
into subcircuits and recombines them using classical post-processing. The
development of circuit partitioning and recomposing has focused on tailoring
the simulation frame-work by replacing generic non-local gates with
probabilistic local gates and measuring the classical communication
com-plexity. Designing a protocol that supports algorithms and non-all-to-all
qubit-connected physical hardware remains underdeveloped owing to the
convoluted properties of cut-ting compact controlled unitary gates and hardware
topology. In this study, we introduce shardQ, a method that leverages the
SparseCut algorithm with matrix product state (MPS) compilation and a global
knitting technique. This method elucidates the optimal trade-off between the
computational time and error rate for quantum encoding with a theoretical
proof, evidenced by an ablation analysis using an IBM Mar-rakesh
superconducting-type QPU. This study also presents the results regarding
application readiness.

*Luke Allen Myers,Nigel Lee En Hew,Shun-Li Shang,Zi-Kui Liu*

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates the recursive property of entropy in thermodynamics via zentropy, clarifying entropy's meaning and deriving a rigorous framework for bridging microscopic and macroscopic behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The recursive property of entropy is well known in information theory but rarely used in thermodynamics, despite its origins there. This work aims to bridge this gap and demonstrate the recursive property in the context of zentropy.

Method: The work clarifies the meaning of entropy as uncertainty from unconstrained degrees of freedom, separates configurational contributions, and derives the partition function by maximizing entropy in its recursive form.

Result: The derived framework is exact for a chosen level of description, facilitates principled coarse-graining, reduces computational complexity, and preserves thermodynamic consistency.

Conclusion: The paper positions zentropy as a rigorous bridge between microscopic and macroscopic behavior, enabling quantitative predictions and the study of emergent phenomena.

Abstract: The recursive property of entropy is well known in the field of information
theory; however, the concept is rarely used in the field of thermodynamics,
despite being the field where the concept of entropy originated. This work
shows that the equation for entropy used in the zentropy, which is an exact
multiscale approach to thermodynamics, is a statement of the recursive property
of entropy. Further, we clarify the meaning of entropy as the uncertainty
arising from unconstrained degrees of freedom and separate configurational
contributions from intra-configurational ones. Building on this, we derive the
partition function, as used in zentropy, by maximizing entropy in its recursive
form. The resulting framework is exact for a chosen level of description and
enables principled coarse-graining, thereby reducing computational complexity
while preserving thermodynamic consistency. These results position zentropy as
a rigorous bridge between microscopic and macroscopic behavior, facilitating
quantitative predictions and the study of emergent phenomena.

Conclusion: 离散状态马尔可夫模型虽然低估了真实的熵产生率，但可用于判断平面扩散是否处于非平衡态。

Abstract: We investigate nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics in both continuous- and
discrete-state stochastic processes. Our analysis focuses on planar diffusion
dynamics and their coarse-grained approximations by discrete-state Markov
chains. Using finite-volume approximations, we derive an approximate master
equation directly from the underlying diffusion and show that this
discretisation preserves key features of the nonequilibrium steady-state. In
particular, we show that the entropy production rate of the approximation
converges as the number of discrete states goes to the limit. These results are
illustrated with analytically solvable diffusions and numerical experiments on
nonlinear processes, demonstrating how this approach can be used to explore the
dependence of entropy production rate on model parameters. Finally, we address
the problem of inferring discrete-state Markov models from continuous
stochastic trajectories. We show that discrete-state models significantly
underestimate the true entropy production rate. However, we also show that they
can provide tests to determine if a stationary planar diffusion is out of
equilibrium. This property is illustrated with both simulated data and
empirical trajectories from schooling fish.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the properties of ESZM in systems that break bulk U(1) symmetry and understand their impact on boundary coherence times and dynamics.

Method: Constructing exact strong zero mode operators (ESZM) in integrable quantum circuits and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain under general open boundary conditions.

Result: The ESZM is localized around one boundary, leading to infinite boundary coherence times, but becomes non-local in the context of the asymmetric simple exclusion process.

Conclusion: The ESZM does not significantly influence the dynamics of the asymmetric simple exclusion process, as it becomes spatially non-local under the transformation from the spin-1/2 XXZ chain.

Abstract: We construct exact strong zero mode operators (ESZM) in integrable quantum
circuits and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for general open boundary conditions, which
break the bulk U(1) symmetry of the time evolution operators. We show that the
ESZM is localized around one of the boundaries induces infinite boundary
coherence times. Finally we prove that the ESZM becomes spatially non-local
under the map that relates the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the asymmetric simple
exclusion process, which suggests that it does not play a significant role in
the dynamics of the latter.

TL;DR: A study on La₃Ni₂O₇ thin films reveals weaker antferromagnetic couplings and reduced charge-transfer gaps compared to bulk, providing insights into nickelate superconductors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discovery of superconductivity above 40 K in La₃Ni₂O₇ and (La,Pr)₃Ni₂O₇ thin films at ambient pressure inspired this study.

Method: The researchers used an 11-band Hubbard model with tight-binding parameters derived from ab initio calculations. They employed large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory approaches.

Result: The antiferromagnetic superexchange couplings in thin films are significantly weaker than in the bulk, with out-of-plane correlations reduced by about 27%. Charge-transfer gaps are smaller in films, and particle-hole asymmetry in carrier doping is observed.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for future research on the low-energy t-J model of La₃Ni₂O₇ thin films and offers key insights into the differences between film and bulk bilayer nickelate superconductors.

Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with $T_c$ above 40 K in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure
marks a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Motivated by the
recent experimental reports, we study an 11-band Hubbard model with
tight-binding parameters derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations of
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, by using large scale determinant quantum Monte
Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory approaches. Our results
demonstrate that the major antiferromagnetic superexchange couplings in
thin-film La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ can be significantly weaker than in the bulk at
29.5 Gpa. The out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between
Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is significantly reduced by about 27% in film,
whereas, the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unchanged. We
estimate the antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\parallel}$ and
$J_{\perp}$ by using perturbation theory. Regarding charge transfer, we find
that biaxial compression in the thin films results in reduced charge-transfer
gap compared to the bulk material. We determine the distribution of doped holes
and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) orbitals
and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals. A significant
particle-hole asymmetry regarding carrier doping is revealed. Our results
provide a foundation for subsequent studies of the low-energy $t-J$ model of
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, and ofer key insights into the understanding of
physical differences between the film and bulk bilayer nickelate
high-temperature superconductors.

Motivation: To address the challenge of deriving an explicit many-body BCS wave function under open boundary conditions, which is typically nontrivial, and to enhance understanding of p + is superconducting chains.

Method: Construction of the exact BCS ground state wave function under open boundary conditions for special parameter sets, calculation of spin magnetization on edges, and derivation of an approximate wave function using degenerate perturbation theory.

Result: Exact BCS ground state wave function for specific parameters, explicit calculation of edge spin magnetization, and an approximate wave function for cases where the s-wave component is much smaller than the p-wave one.

Conclusion: The study provides an explicit form of the BCS ground state wave function for a one-dimensional spin-1/2 superconductor with p + is pairing symmetry under open boundary conditions, offering deeper insights into the system's behavior on a wave function level.

Abstract: Although BCS wave function for superconductors under periodic boundary
conditions are well-established, obtaining an explicit form of the many-body
BCS wave function under open boundary condition is usually a nontrivial
problem. In this work, we construct the exact BCS ground state wave function of
a one-dimensional spin-1/2 superconductor with $p+ is$ pairing symmetry under
open boundary conditions for special sets of parameters. The spin magnetization
on the edges are calculated explicitly using the obtained wave function.
Approximate expression of the wave function is also discussed based on
degenerate perturbation theory when the $s$-wave component is much smaller than
the $p$-wave one, which provides more intuitive understanding for the system.
Our work is useful for obtaining deeper understandings of open $p+ is$
superconducting chains on a wave function level.

Abstract: We study the interplay between altermagnetism and unconventional
superconductivity for the case of two-dimensional square- and
triangular-lattice systems. Our approach is based on an effective single
particle Hamiltonian which mimics the alternating spin splitting characteristic
for the $d$-$wave$ and $i$-$wave$ altermagnetic state. By supplementing the
model with intersite pairing term we characterize the principal features of the
coexistent altermagnetic-superconducting state as well as the possibility of
inducing the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase. Our calculations
show that the subtle interplay between the symmetries of the superconducting
and altermagnetic order parameters as well as the shape/size of the Fermi
surface lead to various types of anisotropic behaviors of the resultant
non-zero momentum pairing, which has not been possible in the originally
proposed FFLO state. Moreover, in the considered systems additional pairing
symmetries appear leading to an exotic multi-component order parameter with
singlet-triplet mixing. To interpret the obtained data we analyze the Cooper
pair density in the momentum space and the corresponding Fermi wave vector
mismatch resulting from the altermagnetic spin splitting. We discuss our result
in the context of possible applications like, e.g., the superconducting diode.

TL;DR: ARPES study of electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ reveals parallels with cuprate superconductors, showing a unified route to nodal metallicity in doped Mott insulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the emergent phenomena in doped Mott insulators near the insulator-to-metal transition, particularly the parallels between cuprate superconductors and their 5$	extit{d}$-electron counterparts.

Method: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) was used to examine electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$.

Result: At low doping, electronic states form near the Fermi level with an AFM gap. Increasing doping introduces a nodal gap, which persists after the AFM gap collapses and eventually vanishes into a point node of a $	extit{d}$-wave gap.

Conclusion: The study replicates characteristic features from electron- and hole-doped cuprates, suggesting a unified route to nodal metallicity in doped spin-1/2 AFM Mott insulators.

Abstract: Many emergent phenomena appear in doped Mott insulators near the
insulator-to-metal transition. In high-temperature cuprate superconductors,
superconductivity arises when antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is gradually
suppressed by carrier doping, and a $\textit{d}$-wave superconducting gap forms
when an enigmatic nodal gap evolves into a point node. Here, we examine
electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$, the 5$\textit{d}$-electron counterpart of
cuprates, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. At low doping
levels, we observe the formation of electronic states near the Fermi level,
accompanied by a gap at the AFM zone boundary, mimicking the AFM gap in
electron-doped cuprates. With increasing doping, a distinct gap emerges along
the (0,0)-($\pi$,$\pi$) nodal direction, paralleling that observed in
hole-doped cuprates. This anomalous nodal gap persists after the collapse of
the AFM gap and gradually decreases with further doping. It eventually vanishes
into a point node of the reported $\textit{d}$-wave gap. These observations
replicate the characteristic features in both electron- and hole-doped
cuprates, indicating a unified route toward nodal metallicity in doped spin-1/2
AFM Mott insulators.
