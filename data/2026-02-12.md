Abstract: The sublattice-symmetry breaking in the $α-T_3$ lattice leads to a bandgap opening. A defect line in the substrate on which the $α-T_3$ lattice is deposited can be viewed as a topological change in the substrate that induces translational in-plane symmetry breaking, resulting in mid-gap states. These topologically protected states are confined along the defect line and exhibit preferential directional motion, with different signs for the different Dirac valleys. Within this context, we investigate how these unidirectional interface chiral states are affected in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and how they can be tuned by varying the controlling system parameter $α$. The latter tunes the $α-T_3$ structure from a honeycomb-like lattice ($α=0$) to a dice lattice ($α=1$). Our theoretical framework is based on the continuum approximation described by a $3\times 3$ matrix Hamiltonian with a sublattice symmetry-breaking term given by $Δ(x) diag(1,\quad -1,\quad 1)$, assuming $Δ(x)$ as a kink-like mass potential profile. Results for dispersion relations and wavefunction distributions for different $α$ parameters and magnetic field amplitudes are discussed. We demonstrate lifting of Landau levels degeneracy and of valley degeneracy. Our findings pave the way for proposing valley filter devices based on any evolutionary stage between the honeycomb-like and dice lattice structures of the $α-T_3$ phase, controlled by external fields.

Abstract: In this work, we numerically investigate linear thermal noise in a four-terminal system with a finite Berry curvature dipole (BCD) using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. By comparing with the semiclassical results for bulk systems, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between terminal-resolved linear noise in multi-terminal systems and direction-resolved noise in bulk transport. Specifically, the auto-correlation function scales as $2 k_B T$ when the driving field is perpendicular to the BCD and vanishes when they are parallel, whereas the cross-correlation scales as $k_B T$. Both the auto- and cross-correlation functions exhibit pronounced peaks near the band edges, consistent with BCD-induced features. In addition, the linear thermal noise increases approximately linearly with $T$ at low temperatures and is suppressed by dephasing effect at high temperatures. Our work bridges semiclassical bulk theory and quantum multi-terminal theory for linear thermal noise, highlighting the symmetry(geometry)-selection rule in quantum transport.

Abstract: We investigate fractional edge modes in moire fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, focusing on the role of lattice momentum conservation and umklapp scattering. For the hierarchical nu=2/3 state, we show that, for a class of microscopic edge realizations, moire-enabled umklapp processes can stabilize the Kane-Fisher-Polchinski fixed point even in the absence of disorder.Our results illustrate how lattice momentum constraints can qualitatively reshape the interaction structure and low-energy behavior of fractional edge modes. The study of Umklapp processes in edge reconstruction serves as a crucial bridge to understanding thermal and electrical transport in the hierarchical fractional quantum anomalous Hall states found in lattice systems of quantum simulators.

Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) provides strong light-matter interactions that can be used for manipulating and detecting quantum states. The interaction can be enhanced by increasing the resonator's impedance, while approaching the quantum impedance ($h/e^2$) remains challenging. Edge plasmons emergent as chiral bosonic modes in the quantum Hall channels provide high quantized impedance of $h/ νe^2$ that can exceed 10 k$Ω$ for the Landau-level filling factor $ν\leq 2$, well beyond the impedance of free space. Here, we apply such a high-impedance plasmon mode in a quantum-Hall plasmon resonator to demonstrate dispersive detection of a nearby charge qubit formed in a double quantum dot. The phase shift in microwave transmission through the plasmon resonator follows the dispersive shift associated with the qubit state in agreement with the cQED theory. The high impedance allows us to perform dispersive detection of qubit spectroscopy with a plasmon resonator having a broad bandwidth. Leveraging these topological edge modes, our results establish two-dimensional topological insulators as a new platform of cQED.

Abstract: In twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs), atomic reconstruction gives rise to moiré domains with alternating ferroelectric polarization, whose domain size and overall electric dipole moment are tunable by an out-of-plane electric field. Previous transport measurements in Hall bar devices have successfully demonstrated the overall ferroelectric behavior of tTMDs from a collective ensemble of ferroelectric moiré domains. To locally probe a single ferroelectric moiré domain, we fabricate and study mesoscopic quantum transport via a gate-defined twisted molybdenum disulfide (tMoS2) quantum point contact (QPC). The local property of a single moiré domain is invulnerable to long-range disorder and twist-angle inhomogeneity, resulting in an unusually long conductance plateau with large electrical hysteresis. The comparison between local and global measurements confirms that antiferroelectricity can emerge from alternating polarization of individual ferroelectric domains. Using a QPC as a single charge sensor, we characterize the nature and time scale of different domain evolution mechanisms with single atomic dipole resolution. Our findings shed new light on the microscopic ferroelectric behavior and dynamics within a single tTMD moiré domain, paving the way toward more advanced ferroelectric quantum devices with tunable local Hamiltonian, such as ferroelectric tTMD quantum dots (QDs).

Abstract: The dispersion of Rashba-split heavy-hole subbands in GaAs two-dimensional hole gases (2DHGs) is difficult to access experimentally because strong heavy-hole-light-hole mixing produces non-parabolicity and breaks the usual correspondence between carrier density and Fermi wave vector. Here we use low-field magnetotransport (B < 1 T) to reconstruct the dispersions of the two spin-orbit-split heavy-hole branches (HH-, HH+) in undoped (100) GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunction 2DHGs operated in an accumulation-mode field-effect geometry. The dopant-free devices sustain out-of-plane electric fields up to 26 kV/cm while maintaining mobilities up to 84 m$^2$/Vs and exhibiting a spin-orbit polarization as large as 36%. Fourier analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations resolves the individual HH-/HH+ subband densities; fitting the temperature dependence of the corresponding Fourier amplitudes yields both branch-resolved SdH effective masses over the same magnetic field window. SdH regimes in which reliable subband parameters can be extracted are delineated. Over 2DHG densities (0.76-1.9) $\times$ 10$^{15}$ /m$^2$, the HH- mass is nearly density independent ($\approx 0.34m_e$), implying a near-parabolic HH- dispersion below the first LH+/HH- anticrossing, whereas HH+ exhibits strong non-parabolicity with an effective mass that increases with density. Combining the extracted dispersions yields a transport-based determination of the spin-orbit splitting energy $Δ_\text{HH}$ between HH and HH+ as a function of in-plane wave vector. Parameter-free Luttinger-model calculations reproduce the qualitative trends but underestimate both masses by a common factor $\approx$ 2, suggesting a many-body renormalization of the heavy-hole mass in this strongly asymmetric regime.

Abstract: Open quantum systems are often described by a Lindblad master equation, which relies on a set of approximations, most importantly the rotating-wave approximation which is only valid for weak damping. In the Lindblad setting, dissipative processes are described through jump operators, distinguishing between absorption and emission of photons. This enables the simple identification of emitted photons which provides a straightforward way to obtain the radiation statistics. Outside the rotating-wave limit, the Lindblad approach does not work. Open quantum systems can then be described by, e.g., the quantum Langevin equation. However, in this framework the number of emitted photons is not easily accessible. In this work, we point out how to obtain the photon counting statistics from a quantum Langevin equation and provide an expression for the photon current operator, for arbitrary systems coupled to linear environments. As an example, we employ the method to study the radiation statistics of a damped harmonic oscillator at finite temperature beyond the rotating-wave approximation. We show that even outside the rotating-wave limit, the most important contribution to the radiation statistics can be captured by an effective Lindblad equation, thus extending the range of possible applications of the Lindblad framework.

Abstract: Isomerization in molecular systems almost invariably occurs through 3-dimensional motion due to the nature of chemical bonding. Pseudorotation is an unusual type of isomerization that occurs in some high symmetry systems that gives the appearance of rigid-body rotation yet only involves atom rearrangements. This paper demonstrates that pseudorotation occurs in 2-dimensions in an optical matter (OM) system of metal nanoparticle constituents. The difference in dimensionality of the dynamics arises from the electrodynamic field-interference nature of optical binding vs. quantum mechanical bonding in polyatomic molecules. The 8-nanoparticle OM "kite" structure we study in experiments and simulations has D2 (D2h) symmetry and a D4 symmetric transition state. The mechanism for pseudorotation involves correlated motion of all 8 nanoparticles with smooth (continuous) evolution of their interactions and without particles jumping in or out of the OM array. While the OM kite structure only occurs with 10% probability vs. other OM isomers, its rate of pseudorotation is rapid relative to transitions to other structural isomers (e.g., "teardrop"). The other isomers have structures that lie on a trigonal lattice with inter-particle separations at distances that enhance field interference and induced polarizations. Even though the kite isomer has inter-particle separations that would manifest destructive interference on a particle pair (i.e., 2-body) basis, the kite structure is the slowest to rearrange into any other isomer. We show that the unusual structure and dynamics of the kite optical matter system result from N-body interactions and forces demonstrating that N-body effects are important in this class of active matter and presumably more generally.

Abstract: This work investigates the Floquet dynamics of electrons and excitons (particle-hole pairs) in a Dirac material referred to as Kekulé-distorted graphene. Specifically, we examine the role played by a high frequency driving electromagnetic field on the tunneling and blocking by a potential barrier on both the charged single particles as well as the neutral composite particles. We demonstrate that the small effective masses of the electron and hole for the energy spectrum of this Kekulé distorted graphene leads to practically almost perfect transmission across a symmetric potential barrier for any angle of incidence of impinging excitons. However, this unexpected Klein paradox for excitons does not hold for the single-particle electrons. The reduced total transmission of electron due to Kekulé distortion is more suppressed due to irradiation. Additionally, we calculate and investigate the exciton binding energy since the quantum tunneling of a bound electron-hole pair across a potential barrier is governed by its mass measured in the center of mass and binding energy of the composite pair. Thus, irradiation with circularly polarized light fundamentally modifies exciton formation, coherence and transport properties, thereby producing unusual topological behaviors. These behaviors are unlike conventional Dirac materials. Possible technical applications of the results arising from our investigation include valleytronics due to the folding of the valleys, thereby making intervalley coupling feasible. Other practical applications include optoelectronics due to Floquet tuning of energy spectrum and transport properties.

Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems exhibit extreme sensitivity to boundary conditions, typically manifesting as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under open boundaries. By bridging the boundaries with a tunable impurity bond, one can access intermediate regimes where scale-free localization (SFL) can emerge. Here, we investigate the competition between such boundary coupling and quasiperiodic disorder in a non-reciprocal lattice. Our analyses reveal a quasiperiodicity-induced breakdown of the SFL regime, which evolves into either the NHSE or an extended regime, depending on boundary conditions. These results uncover the crucial role of quasiperiodicity in non-Hermitian systems.

Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier transformation of the 1+1d transverse-field Ising model exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and, at criticality, manifests as a non-invertible symmetry. Extending such self-duality symmetries beyond gauging of abelian groups in tensor-product Hilbert spaces has, however, remained challenging. In this work, we construct a generalized 1+1d Ising model based on a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra $H$ that enjoys an anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. We provide an intuitive diagrammatic formulation of both the Hamiltonian and the symmetry operators using a non-(co)commutative generalization of ZX-calculus built from Hopf-algebraic data. When $H$ is self-dual, we further construct a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality operator that exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and becomes a non-invertible symmetry at the self-dual point. This enlarged symmetry mixes with lattice translation and, in the infrared, flows to a weakly integral fusion category given by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. Specializing to the Kac-Paljutkin algebra $H_8$, the smallest self-dual Hopf algebra beyond abelian group algebras, we numerically study the phase diagram and identify four of the six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases, separated by Ising critical lines and meeting at a multicritical point. We also realize all six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases on the lattice via the $H$-comodule algebra formalism, in agreement with the module-category classification of $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$. Our results provide a unified Hopf-algebraic framework for non-invertible symmetries, dualities, and the tensor product lattice models that realize them.

Abstract: We study Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) dimer and spin ice models realizing $U(1)$-lattice gauge theories in a wide class of quasi-one-dimensional settings, which define a setup for the study of few quantum strings (closed electric field lines) interacting with themselves and each other. We discover a large collection of mappings of these models onto three quantum chains: the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a spin-1 chain, and a kinetically constrained fermion chain whose configurations are best described in terms of tilings of a rectangular strip. We show that the twist of boundary conditions in the chains maps onto the transverse momentum of the electric field string, and their Drude weight to the inverse of the string mass per unit length. We numerically determine the phase diagrams for these spin chains, employing DMRG simulations and find global similarities but also many interesting new features in comparison to the full 2D problems. For example, the spin-1 chain we obtain features a continuous family of degenerate ground states at its RK point analogous to a Bloch sphere, but without an underlying microscopic global $SU(2)$ symmetry. We also argue for the existence of a (stable) Landau-forbidden gapless critical point away from the RK point in one of the models we study using bosonization and numerics. This is surprising given that the full 2D problem is generically gapped away from the RK point. The same model also displays extensively many local conserved quantities which fragment the Hilbert space, arising as a consequence of destructive resonances between the electric field lines. Our findings highlight spin-chain mappings as a potent technique for the exploration of unusual dynamics, exotic criticality, and low-energy physics in lattice gauge theories.

Abstract: Topological spin textures are hallmark manifestations of competing interactions in magnetic matter. Their effective description by nonlinear field theories reflects an energetic frustration that destabilizes uniform order while selecting finite-size, topologically nontrivial configurations as stationary states. Among the most extreme realizations are atomically-sharp domain wall excitations, namely one-dimensional (1D) magnetic solitons, which represent the ultimate scaling limit of magnetic textures. Such solitons may emerge in magnetic systems where effective exchange interactions compete directly with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Here we show that the square-net rare earth compound EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ realizes a very susceptible regime where the magnetic anisotropy competes with highly frustrated exchange interactions stabilizing a rare ferrimagnetic $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ state that, under applied magnetic field, supports the formation of atomically-sharp soliton defects. We confirm the bulk response of the 1D magnetic solitons via magnetization and electrical transport measurements. We establish both the zero- and in-field $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ order via neutron diffraction, while magnetic force microscopy visualizes its real-space evolution into a stripe-like array. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the soliton, we relate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-driven exchange interactions and the magnetic anisotropy through density functional theory, and we construct an effective 1D $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$K$ model whose atomistic spin dynamics simulations reproduce the observed soliton states as a function of external field. Our results demonstrate that EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ hosts atomically-sharp, field-driven 1D magnetic solitons, providing a new platform for studying 1D topological excitations at the atomic length scale.

Abstract: The understanding of the mechanisms responsible for superconductivity in strongly correlated systems is an interesting and important subject in condensed matter physics. Several theoretical proposals were considered for these systems. The Coulomb interaction between electrons allow a new approach to study this problem. In this paper, we use a usual Hubbard model with a local repulsive interaction to describe a 2D system. The system of equations are solved using the Green's functions method, within a Hubbard-I mean field approximation, which allows to treat the strong interaction limit. We consider both cases of attractive and repulsive interactions and obtain the zero temperature phase diagram of the model. Our results show, in the repulsive case, the existence of a superconducting ground state mediated by the kinetic electronic energy and described by a non-local order parameter. A minimum value of the repulsive interaction $U_{min}$ is required to create a pairing state. At finite temperatures, for strong interactions, the critical temperature $T_c$ shows a saturation similar to the Bose-Einstein condensation observed for strong attractive interactions.

Abstract: Progress toward a complete understanding of cuprate superconductors has been hindered by their intricate phase diagram, potentially linked to a quantum critical point (QCP). However, conclusive evidence for the QCP is lacking, as the presumed QCP is buried under the superconducting dome, disguising its presence. Here, we use high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to examine the dynamical charge-charge correlation in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and uncover the quantum critical scaling, a key feature required for a QCP. Specifically, \djh{we observed that the inverse correlation lengths for various dopings and temperatures collapsed onto a universal scaling curve, yielding a critical exponent $ν$ of $0.74 \pm 0.08$. The non-negativity of this exponent confirms the presence of a QCP. Remarkably, the value of $ν$ suggests that while the QCP is manifested through the charge-density wave, other orders also participate, such that the QCP appears to belong to the universality class characterized by the O(4) symmetry, reminiscent of the microscopic SO(4) symmetry in the Hubbard model at half-filling. Further analysis indicates that the QCP is highly dissipative with a short quasi-particle lifetime, reflecting the intertwined quantum fluctuations due to its being buried inside the superconducting state.

Abstract: The undoped Kondo necklace in 1D is a paradigmatic and well understood model of a Kondo insulator. This work performs the first large-scale study of the 1D Anderson-lattice underlying the Kondo necklace with quasi-exact numerical methods, comparing this with the perturbative effective 1D Kondo-necklace model derived from the former. This study is based on an exact mapping of the Anderson model to one of a superconducting pairing layer connected to a metallic reservoir which is valid in arbitrary spatial dimensions, thereby linking the previously disparate areas of reservoir-enhanced superconductivity, following Kivelson's pioneering proposals, and that of periodic Kondo-systems. Our work reveals that below the length-scales on which the insulating state sets in, which can be very large, superconducting and density-density correlations are degenerate and may both appear to approach an almost ordered state, to a degree that far exceeds that of any isolated 1D pairing layer with short-range interactions. We trace these effects to the effective extended-range coupling that the metallic layer mediates within the pairing layer. These results translate directly to the appearance of near-long-range magnetic order at intermediate scales in the Kondo-systems, and explain the strong renormalization of the RKKY-coupling that we effectively observe, in terms of the back-action of the pairing layer onto the metallic layer. The effects we predict could be tested either by local probes of quasi-1D heavy fermion compounds such as CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, in engineered chains of ad-atoms or in ultracold atomic gases.

Abstract: Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are generally competing ground states in $d$-electron systems, making their interplay of fundamental interest. We report a comprehensive study of high-quality single- and polycrystalline V$_2$Ga$_5$, a bulk type-II superconductor ($T_c = 3.54 \ K$) with a quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure, supplemented with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, suggesting possible proximity to ferromagnetic order. Below $T \approx 10 \ K$, magnetic susceptibility shows ZFC/FC splitting, along with saturation and hysteresis in $M(H)$. Moreover, electrical transport measurements reveal a magnetic-field-dependent resistivity upturn, while specific heat is enhanced in magnetic fields. DFT calculations show that the Fermi level in V$_2$Ga$_5$ is located at a peak in the density of states, with a small magnetic moment per unit cell comparable to the experimental value. Together, these results indicate the possibility that ferromagnetic correlations develop below $T \approx 10 \ K$, well above $T_c$, with long-range ferromagnetic order suppressed by the superconducting transition.

Abstract: One of the long standing puzzles in strongly correlated materials is the microscopic origin of the quantum critical Planckian strange metal phase with universal linear in temperature scattering rate from which unconventional superconductivity directly emerges by lowering temperatures. Recently, the linear in temperature and linear in field resistivity have been simultaneously observed in high temperature cuprate superconductors, manifested by the universal field to temperature scaling in magnetoresistivity. To date, there has been a lack of coherent and unified understanding of these coexisting linear behaviors and their possible link to quantum criticality. In this work, we establish the universality in linear in temperature and linear in field Planckian behaviors in underdoped LSCO near optimal doping. Experimentally, we observe the linear in field Planckian scattering rate and its relation to its linear in temperature counterpart. Theoretically, we propose a spin based common microscopic mechanism based on Kondo-like charge fluctuations near local quantum criticality of heavy fermion formulated tJ model subject to a Zeeman term. Similar to frequency to temperature scaling near quantum criticality, we find the magnetic field here effectively introduces a Zeeman energy, reminiscent of an external energy in the quantum critical regime, leading to field to temperature scaling. Our analytically predicted universal field to temperature scaling in isotropic scattering rate and the relation between the linear in temperature and linear in field Planckian coefficients, unifies these two phenomena over an extended doping range, pointing toward a unified quantum-critical origin of Planckian transport in cuprates.

Abstract: Due to their high kinetic inductance, highly disordered superconducting thin films are a potential hardware for the realization of compact, low-noise elements in cryoelectronic applications. However, high disorder typically results in structural defects that cause spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting order parameter, thereby impairing the film's properties. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to demonstrate that NbN thin films fabricated by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) exhibit unusual spatial homogeneity, even at thicknesses approaching the superconductor-insulator transition. Tunneling spectra acquired across the sample surface show only small variations of the order parameter with a standard deviation of 2-3%, on length scales that significantly exceed the film's grain size. At the same time, the films achieve a relatively high sheet resistance (up to 1400 Ohm) and, consequently, a high sheet kinetic inductance (up to approximately 200 pH), making them well-suited for applications.

Abstract: Cuprate superconductors display robust in-plane electronic correlations but exceptionally fragile interlayer coherence. We suggest that even weak vertically correlated disorder (arising from interstitial-oxygen staging, twin boundaries, extended strain fields, or defect-pinned charge textures) can impose a layer-dependent modulation of the interlayer tunneling amplitude t(z). Because the bare interlayer coupling is intrinsically small, such modulations generate an effectively multichannel c-axis electrodynamic response, consistent with multi-component Josephson plasma resonances, nonmonotonic c-axis resistivity, redistribution of bilayer magnetic spectral weight, and field-enhanced vertical CDW correlations. We propose a phenomenological framework in which the organization of disorder, rather than its magnitude, governs the effective interlayer coupling and its electrodynamic signatures. This viewpoint unifies diverse c-axis anomalies across several cuprate families, suggesting that controlling vertical disorder correlations offers a viable pathway for tuning dimensionality and interlayer coherence in high-Tc superconductors.

Abstract: We report on a computational and experimental study of permanents. On the computational side, we use the GPU to greaatly accelerate the computation of permanents over $\mathbb{C},$ $\mathbb{R},$ $\mathbb{F}_p$ and $\mathbb{Q}.$ In particular, we use this to compute the permanents of DFT and Schur matrices far beyond the ranges hitherto known. On the experimental side, we present two new observations. First, for Haar-distributed unitary matrices~$U$, the permanent $\perm(U)$ follows a circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,σ^2)$ -- we confirm this via a number of tests for $n$ up to~23 with $50{,}000$ samples. The DFT matrix permanent is an extreme outlier for every prime $n\ge 7$. In contrast, for Haar-random \emph{orthogonal} matrices~$O$, the permanent $\perm(O)$ is approximately real Gaussian but with positive excess kurtosis that decays as~$O(1/n)$, indicating slower convergence. For matrices with Gaussian entries (GUE, GOE, Ginibre), the permanent follows an $α$-stable distribution with stability index $α\approx 1.0$--$1.4$, well below the Gaussian value $α=2$.
  Secondly, we study the permanent along geodesics on the unitary group. For the geodesic from the identity to the $n$-cycle permutation matrix, we find a universal scaling function $f(t)=\frac{1}{n}\ln|\perm(γ(t))|$ that is independent of~$n$ in the large-$n$ limit, with a midpoint value \[
  \perm(γ({\textstyle\frac12}))
  = (-1)^{(n-1)/2}\cdot 2e^{-n}\bigl(1+\tfrac{1}{3n}+O(n^{-2})\bigr) \] for odd~$n$ and zero for even~$n$. For the geodesic to the DFT matrix, the permanent recovers $10$--$40$ times above its valley minimum when $n$ is prime, but not when $n$ is composite -- a geodesic fingerprint of primality.

Abstract: Entanglement percolation aims at generating maximal entanglement between any two nodes of a quantum network by utilizing strategies based solely on local operations and classical communication between the nodes. As it happens in classical percolation theory, the topology of the network is crucial, but also the entanglement shared between the nodes of the network. In a network of identically partially entangled states, the network topology determines the minimum entanglement needed for percolation. In this work, we generalize the protocol to scenarios where the initial entanglement shared between each two nodes of the network is not the same but has some randomness. In such cases, we find that for classical entanglement percolation, only the average initial entanglement is relevant. In contrast, the quantum entanglement percolation protocol generally performs worse under these more realistic conditions.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between genuine entanglement harvesting and communication mediated correlations for local particle detectors in expanding cosmological spacetimes. Focusing on a conformally coupled scalar field in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze how spacetime expansion induces interference between these two sources of entanglement when the detectors are in causal contact. We compare two physically distinct detector models: detectors whose spatial profile expands with the Universe, and detectors whose proper size remains fixed despite cosmological expansion. We find that the lack of time-reversal symmetry in cosmological settings generically leads to constructive or destructive interference between communication mediated correlations and harvested field correlations, dramatically affecting the entanglement that detectors can acquire. In particular, rapid expansion can suppress entanglement entirely for expanding detectors through destructive interference, even when both communication and field correlations are individually large, whereas detectors that maintain a fixed proper size remain capable of acquiring significant entanglement. Our results show that cosmological expansion qualitatively reshapes the balance between communication and harvesting, and that the detector internal cohesion (whether it expands with the Universe or not) plays a crucial role in determining whether detectors' entanglement can survive in rapidly expanding universes.

Abstract: Communication complexity, which quantifies the minimum communication required for distributed computation, offers a natural setting for investigating the capabilities and limitations of quantum mechanics in information processing. We introduce an information-theoretic approach to study one-way communication complexity based solely on the axioms of mutual information. Within this framework, we derive an extended statement of the information causality principle, which recovers known lower bounds on the communication complexities for a range of functions in a simplified manner and leads to new results. We further prove that the extended information causality principle is at least as strong as the principle of non-trivial communication complexity in bounding the strength of quantum correlations attainable in Bell experiments. Our study establishes a new route for exploring the fundamental limits of quantum technologies from an information-theoretic viewpoint.

Abstract: Quantum operations with indefinite causal order (ICO) represent a framework in quantum information processing where the relative order between two events can be indefinite. In this paper, we investigate whether sensing and computation, two canonical tasks in quantum information processing, can be carried out within the ICO framework. We propose a scheme for integrated sensing and computation that uses the same quantum state for both tasks. The quantum state is represented as an agent that performs state observation and learns a function of the state to make predictions via a parametric model. Under an ICO operation, the agent experiences a superposition of orders, one in which it performs state observation and then executes the required computation steps, and another in which the agent carries out the computation first and then performs state observation. This is distinct from prevailing information processing and machine intelligence paradigms where information acquisition and learning follow a strict causal order, with the former always preceding the latter. We provide experimental results and we show that the proposed scheme can achieve small training and testing losses on a representative task in magnetic navigation.

Abstract: A phase-space approach is used and benchmarked for the simulation of the continuous-time evolution of large registers of qubits. It is based on a statistical ensemble of independent mean-field trajectories, where mean-field is introduced at the level of the qubits, substituting quantum fluctuations/correlations with classical ones. The approach only involves at worse a quadratic cost in the system size, allowing to simulate up to several thousands of qubits on a classical computer. It provides qualitatively accurate description of one-qubit observables evolutions, making it a useful reference in comparison to techniques limited to small qubit numbers. The predictive power is however less robust for multi-qubits observables. We benchmark the method on the $k$-local transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), considering a large variety of systems ranging from local to all-to-all interactions, and from weak to strong coupling regimes, with up to 2000 qubits. To showcase the versatility of the approach, simulations on 2D and 3D Ising models are also made.

Abstract: Trapped-ion lattice geometries, which determine the interactions between trapped-ion qubits, are typically governed by the balance of Coulomb repulsion forces with the external trapping potential. Here we demonstrate how the effective ion lattice geometry and resulting qubit-qubit interactions may be reconfigured in-situ, by shelving specific ions in metastable states outside the qubit subspace. Using a triangular lattice of three $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ ions, we optically pump selected ions into the long-lived $^2F_{7/2}$ state. We then apply a global Ising-like Hamiltonian to the system and verify that the shelved qubits are fully removed from participation in the quantum dynamics. We characterize the metastable state lifetime in the presence of laser-driven ion-ion interactions, finding a deshelving rate that is orders of magnitude slower than the spin-spin interaction rate and scales quadratically with applied laser intensity.

Abstract: When sensitive information is encoded in data, it is important to ensure the privacy of information when attempting to learn useful information from the data. There is a natural tradeoff whereby increasing privacy requirements may decrease the utility of a learning protocol. In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\varepsilon,δ)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $Θ((\varepsilon β)^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $β$ is the accuracy tolerance. We conclude by initiating the study of private classical shadows, which promise useful applications for private learning tasks.

Abstract: Building upon the work of Hu, Paz, and Zhang [1,2] on open quantum systems we consider the quantum Brownian motion (QBM) model with one oscillator (position variable $x$) as the system, {\it nonlinearly} coupled to an environment of $N$ harmonic oscillators (with mass $m_n$, natural frequency $ω_n$, position $q_n$ and momentum $p_n$ variables) in the form $\sum_{n}\left(v_{n1}(x)q_{n}^{k}+v_{n2}(x)p_{n}^{l}\right)$ where $k, l$ are integers (the present work only considers the $k=l=2$ cases). The vertex functions $v_{n1}, v_{n2} $ are of the form $v_{n1}=λC_{n1} f(x), v_{n2}(x)=-λ\,C_{n2}m_{n}^{-2}ω_{n}^{-2}f(x)$ where $C_{n1,2}$ are the coupling constants with the $n$th oscillator, $f(x)$ is any arbitrary function of $x$, and $λ$ is a dimensionless constant. Employing the closed-time-path formalism the influence action $S_{IF}$ is calculated using a perturbative expansion in $λ$. It is possible to identify the terms in $S_{IF}$ quadratic or higher in $Δ(s)\equiv f(x_{+}(s))-f(x_{-}(s))$ to constitute the noise kernel, while terms linear in $Δ$ to that of the dissipation kernel. The non-Gaussian noise kernel gives rise to non-zero three-point correlation function of the corresponding stochastic force. The pathway presented here should be useful for the exploration of \textit{non-Gaussian properties of systems nonlinearly coupled with their environments}; examples in early universe cosmology and in quantum optomechanics (QOM) are mentioned. A modified fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) is also established, which ensures the consistency of the model and the accuracy of results even at higher perturbative orders. Another result of significance is the derivation of a nonlinear Langevin equation which is expected to be useful for many open quantum system applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The original version of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory, also called Bohmian mechanics, attempted to treat the wave function or pilot wave as a part of the physical ontology of nature. More recent versions of the de Broglie-Bohm theory appearing in the last few decades have tried to regard the pilot wave instead as an aspect of the theory's nomology, or dynamical laws. This paper argues that neither of these views is correct, and that the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave is best understood as a collection of latent variables in the sense of a hidden Markov model, a construct that was not available when de Broglie and Bohm originally formulated what became their pilot-wave theory. This paper also discusses several other challenges for the ontological view of the pilot wave. One such challenge is due to Foldy-Wouthuysen gauge transformations, which connect up with the Deotto-Ghirardi ambiguity in the de Broglie-Bohm theory. Another challenge arises from the freedom to carry out canonical transformations in the wave function's own notion of phase space, as defined by Strocchi and Heslot.

Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a state initially farther from equilibrium relaxes more rapidly than one that starts nearer to equilibrium. In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing.

Abstract: We develop a general theoretical framework for characterizing stable quantum resources between microwave and optical modes in the dynamics of multipartite hybrid quantum systems with intermediary modes. The effective Hamiltonian for microwave-optical (MO) squeezing is formulated via strong interactions in the microwave-intermediary-optical hybrid system, and based on which rigorous solutions for the dynamics of MO entanglement and quantum steering are derived analytically. Remarkably, it is found that stable MO quantum resources can survive in the unsteady evolution beyond the steady one, and the unsteady evolution can exhibit the enhanced quality over the limit of quantum resources in the steady-state case. Furthermore, the stable MO entanglement as well as one-way and two-way quantum steerings are efficiently controllable by modulating the effective coupling strength. The validity of our theory is demonstrated by applying it to the typical models of electro-optomechanical and cavity optomagnomechanical hybrid systems.

Abstract: Block encoding is a successful technique used in several powerful quantum algorithms. In this work we provide an explicit quantum circuit for block encoding a sparse matrix with a periodic diagonal structure. The proposed methodology is based on the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) framework and on an efficient unitary operator used to project the complex exponential at a frequency $ω$ multiplied by the computational basis into its real and imaginary components. We demonstrate a distinct computational advantage with a $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(n))$ gate complexity, where $n$ is the number of qubits, in the worst-case scenario used for banded matrices, and $\mathcal{O}(n)$ when dealing with a simple diagonal matrix, compared to the exponential scaling of general-purpose methods for dense matrices. Various applications for the presented methodology are discussed in the context of solving differential problems such as the advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) dynamics, using quantum algorithms with optimal scaling, e.g., quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). Numerical results are used to validate the analytical formulation.

Abstract: The concept of quantum tokens dates back alongside quantum cryptography to Stephen Wiesner's seminal work in 1983[1]. Already this initial work proposes society-relevant applications such as secure quantum banknotes, which can be exchanged between a bank and a customer. This quantum currency is based on various physical states that can be easily verified but is protected from being copied by the fundamental quantum laws. Four decades later, these ideas have flourished in the field of quantum information, and the concept of quantum banknotes has not only adopted many varying names, such as quantum money, quantum coins, quantum-digital payments, and quantum tokens, but also reached its first experimental demonstrations. In this perspective article, we discuss the current state-of-the-art of quantum tokens in the field of quantum information, as well as their future perspectives. We present a number of physical realizations of quantum tokens with integrated quantum memories and their applicability scenarios in detail. Finally, we discuss how quantum tokens fit into the information security ecosystem and consider their relationship to post-quantum cryptography.

Abstract: We present a projection-based, stability-preserving methodology for computing time correlation functions in open quantum systems governed by generalized quantum master equations with non-Markovian effects. Building upon the memory kernel coupling theory framework, our approach transforms the memory kernel hierarchy into a system of coupled linear differential equations through Mori-Zwanzig projection, followed by spectral projection onto stable eigenmodes to ensure numerical stability. By systematically eliminating unstable modes while preserving the physically relevant dynamics, our method guaranties long-time convergence without introducing artificial damping or ad hoc modifications. The theoretical framework maintains mathematical rigor through orthogonal projection operators and spectral decomposition. Benchmark calculations on the spin-boson model show excellent agreement with exact hierarchical equations of motion results while achieving significant computational efficiency. This approach provides a versatile and reliable framework for simulating non-Markovian dynamics in complex systems.

Abstract: We examine the cooling of networks of oscillators through repeated unitary evolution followed by conditional measurement on a finite-dimensional auxiliary system, coupled via Jaynes-Cummings type interaction. We prove that near-perfect cooling of the oscillator to vacuum is fundamentally impossible when the auxiliary system is a qubit, establishing a no-cooling theorem for a two-level regulator. Moving beyond this limitation, we reveal a twofold dimensional advantage of higher-dimensional auxiliaries - reducing the number of required cycles, and enabling the efficient cooling of oscillators with higher initial energies. We further show that, while extending the network leads to a saturation of this dimensional advantage at moderate auxiliary dimensions, near-perfect cooling remains achievable for linear network configurations but fails for star networks. Moreover, we highlight the adaptability of the proposed protocol by demonstrating efficient cooling of hybrid continuous- and discrete-variable systems that naturally support the generation of non-Gaussian and entangled quantum resources.

Abstract: The neutral silicon--vacancy (SiV$^{0}$) center in diamond combines inversion symmetry with optical emission, making it a robust quantum emitter resilient to stray electric fields. Using first-principles density-functional theory, we quantify its response to isotropic strain spanning strong compression and tensile regimes (effective hydrostatic pressures of approximately $-80$ to $180$~GPa). The coexistence of doubly degenerate $e_g$ and $e_u$ levels produces a structural instability captured by a quadratic product Jahn--Teller model. Under isotropic compression, the zero-phonon line blue-shifts nearly linearly while the $E_g$ phonon stiffens, suppressing vibronic instabilities and reducing Jahn--Teller quenching. Consequently, the Ham-reduced excited-state spin--orbit splitting increases substantially and the dark--bright vibronic gap widens. In contrast, isotropic tensile strain enhances vibronic effects and induces symmetry breaking beyond a critical strain, with tunneling-mediated dynamical averaging at the onset. Throughout the symmetry-preserving regime, parity remains well defined, so isotropic strain alone does not activate the dark transition. Charge-transition levels indicate photostability of the emission deep into the compressive regime, and near the highest photostable deformation ($\sim 100$~GPa), the radiative lifetime increases due to a reduced transition dipole moment despite the increasing optical energy. These trends yield compact calibration relations linking optical and spin observables to isotropic strain and establish SiV$^{0}$ as a symmetry-protected, strain-tunable quantum emitter operating into the multi-megabar-equivalent regime.

Abstract: The no-cloning theorem forbids the creation of identical copies of qubits, thereby imposing strong limitations on quantum technologies. A recently-proposed protocol, encrypted cloning, showed, however, that the creation of perfect clones is theoretically possible - if the clones are simultaneously encrypted with a single-use decryption key. It has remained an open question, however, whether encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise and thus practical as a quantum primitive. This is nontrivial because spreading quantum information widely could dilute it until barely exceeding the noise level, leading to catastrophic fidelity decay. Given the complexity of hardware noise, theory and classical simulation are insufficient to settle this. Here, we settle this question experimentally, on IBM Heron-R2 superconducting processors using up to 154 qubits. We find that encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise, even when used as a module, namely in parallel, series or interleaved, while preserving pre-existing entanglement. This establishes it as a versatile quantum primitive for practical use, and it necessitates a refinement to our understanding of the no-cloning theorem: quantum information can be spread at will, in theory and in practice, without dilution or degradation, if encrypted or obscured. The actual constraint is that the decryption mechanism must be single-use.

Two complementary approaches are proposed: CrossQSD, which generalizes unambiguous discrimination with tunable confidence bounds to balance accuracy and efficiency, and FitQSD, which optimizes the measurement outcome distribution to approximate that of the ideal noiseless case. Furthermore, we provide a unified hybrid-objective QSD framework that continuously interpolates between minimum-error discrimination (MED) and FitQSD, allowing flexible trade-offs among competing objectives. The associated optimization problems are formulated as convex programs and efficiently solved via disciplined convex programming or, in many cases, semidefinite programming. Additionally, a circuit synthesis framework based on a modified Naimark dilation and isometry synthesis enables hardware-efficient implementations with substantially reduced qubit and gate resources. An open-source toolkit automates the full optimization and synthesis workflow, providing a practical route to QSD on current quantum devices.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for efficient preparation of electronic ground states, leveraging the optimizer ExcitationSolve [Jäger et al., Comm. Phys. (2025)] and established variational quantum eigensolver-based operator selection methods, such as Energy Sorting. By combining these tools, we demonstrate a computationally efficient protocol that enables the construction of an approximate ground state from a unitary coupled cluster ansatz via a single sweep over the operator pool. Utilizing efficient classical pre-processing to select the majority of relevant operators, this approach reduces the computational complexity associated with traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, we show that this method can be seamlessly integrated with one-variational-parameter couple exchange operators, thereby further reducing the number of required CNOT operations. Overall, we empirically observe a quadratic convergence speedup beyond state-of-the-art methods, advancing the realization of quantum advantage in quantum chemistry.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems, due to the existence of exceptional point (or ring, surface), exhibit exotic topological features which are inaccessible with the Hermition ones. Current studies on NH topology mainly focus on pure states at zero temperature, while those on mixed states remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the topological properties of mixed states in two-dimentional NH systems, by use of the Uhlmann phase and the thermal Uhlmann-Chern number which are structured via the Uhlmann connection at specific temperatures, revealing distinct topological features compared to their pure state counterparts. We further extend our study to the mixed states in the three-dimensional Abelian and four-dimentional non-Abelian NH systems and verify the high-order mixed-state topology. Our study provides a conceptual and practical pathway for exploring topological properties in the mixed-state regime of NH physics.

Abstract: Controlling ensembles of weakly coupled spins typically requires computationally expensive multispin optimisations. We present a compact framework that enables control of weakly coupled spin systems (of any spin), but using RF pulses optimised for a single spin-1/2. We do this by explicitly creating a GRAPE pulse with fixed 'active' evolution times using single spin-1/2 methods, and pulsing on one spin at a time. By enforcing this form uniformly across offsets ('band-schematic' pulses),chemical shift and scalar coupling evolution of the entire system can be precisely controlled. We demonstrate the approach by constructing band-schematic pulses and a continuously irradiated joint INEPT (JINEPT) that achieves band-selective transfer $I_z \rightarrow 2I_zS_z$. The framework is implemented in the software Seedless, which both rapidly generates such pulses and analyses the schematic form of arbitrary pulses, enabling robust multi-spin control, without multi-spin optimisation.

Abstract: Quantum technologies are powered by platforms to generate complex non-classical states of matter or light to realize applications. We investigate the non-classical properties of high-harmonic generation in semiconductors, an emerging photonic platform. Measuring the click statistics of three double-digit orders, we evaluate witness operators to certify the non-classicality of the generated states. We show that higher-order harmonics driven by a coherent laser are squeezed and entangled. The properties of the emission are well retrieved with an entangled Gaussian state model, obtained by numerical state optimization to multiple observables. Additionally, we perform inter-order heralded measurements to engineer the quantum state of the emission. The heralded states have distinct properties, showing anti-bunched photon statistics. Further, we witness the generation of a quantum non-Gaussian state, a resource highly relevant for quantum information. With this, we establish high-harmonic generation as a platform for generating quantum optical resources.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and the increasing availability of quantum hardware have substantially enhanced the practical relevance of quantum approaches to discrete optimization. Among these, the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation provides a unifying modeling framework for a broad class of $\mathbf{NP}$-hard problems and is naturally suited to quantum computing and quantum-inspired algorithms. Location science, network design, and logistics represent core application domains of discrete optimization, combining high practical impact with substantial computational challenges. In this work, we develop QUBO formulations for several fundamental problems in these domains, including a nonlinear integer formulation of the Discrete Ordered Median Problem (DOMP). Beyond their modeling relevance, these QUBO formulations serve as representative benchmark problems for assessing quantum algorithms and quantum hardware. We further derive a tight bound for the penalty parameter ensuring equivalence between the QUBO formulation and its underlying integer program. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive computational study using QAOA, WS-QAOA, and classical heuristics for QUBO instances of the $p$-Median Problem and the Fixed-Charge Facility Location Problem (FCFLP), and introduce two effective warm-start strategies for WS-QAOA based on its linear programming relaxation.

Abstract: Finding optimal solutions of conflicting objectives is a daily matter in many industrial applications, with multi-objective optimization trying to find the best solutions to them. The advent of quantum computing has led to researchers wondering if the promised exponential advantage can be obtained for these problems by variational quantum multi-objective optimization (QMOO) algorithm. Here, we improve it by introducing a Pareto Archive and dominated solutions substitution, clearly improving in hyper-volume convergence at additional quantum and classical cost. We propose the use of RMNK-landscapes as a unifying testbed for benchmarking QMOO, as it is common in classical multi-objective field. By devising a generic classical-to-quantum mapping of these landscapes, we perform a numerical hyperparameter tuning of QMOO, significantly enhancing its performance. Finally, we compare QMOO against well-known classical solvers for multi-objective tasks, NSGA-II/III, showing comparable results in small instances. Our results demonstrate that QMOO, when carefully tuned for the task at hand, might be advantageous on harder problems than its classical counterparts.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in photonics-based deterministic quantum information processing is to realize key transformations on time scales shorter than those of detrimental decoherence and loss mechanisms. This challenge has been addressed through device-focused approaches that aim to increase nonlinear interactions relative to decoherence rates. In this work, we adopt a complementary architecture-focused approach by proposing a recirculating quantum photonic network (RQPN) that minimizes the duration of quantum information processing tasks, thereby reducing the requirements on nonlinear interaction rates. The RQPN consists of a network of all-to-all connected nonlinear cavities with dynamically controlled waveguide couplings, and it processes information by capturing a photonic input state, recirculating photons between the cavities, and releasing a photonic output state. We demonstrate the RQPN's architectural advantage through two examples: first, we show that processing all qubits simultaneously yields faster operations than single- and two-qubit decompositions of the three-qubit Toffoli gate. Second, we demonstrate implementations of a measurement-free correction for single-photon loss, achieving up to seven-fold speedups and significantly improved hardware efficiency relative to state-of-the-art architecture proposals. Our work shows that a single hardware-efficient recirculating architecture substantially reduces the temporal overhead of multi-qubit gates and quantum error correction, thereby lowering the barrier to experimental realizations of deterministic photonic quantum information processing.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Instantaneous quantum polynomial quantum circuit Born machines (IQP-QCBMs) have been proposed as quantum generative models with a classically tractable training objective based on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and a potential quantum advantage motivated by sampling-complexity arguments, making them an exciting model worth deeper investigation. While recent works have further proven the universality of a (slightly generalized) model, the next immediate question pertains to its trainability, i.e., whether it suffers from the exponentially vanishing loss gradients, known as the barren plateau issue, preventing effective use, and how regimes of trainability overlap with regimes of possible quantum advantage. Here, we provide significant strides in these directions. To study the trainability at initialization, we analytically derive closed-form expressions for the variances of the partial derivatives of the MMD loss function and provide general upper and lower bounds. With uniform initialization, we show that barren plateaus depend on the generator set and the spectrum of the chosen kernel. We identify regimes in which low-weight-biased kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression in structured topologies. Also, we prove that a small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial scaling for the gradient under mild conditions. As for the potential quantum advantage, we further argue, based on previous complexity-theoretic arguments, that sparse IQP families can output a probability distribution family that is classically intractable, and that this distribution remains trainable at initialization at least at lower-weight frequencies.

Abstract: Transmon qubits are a cornerstone of modern superconducting quantum computing platforms. Temporal fluctuations of energy relaxation in these qubits are widely attributed to microscopic two-level systems (TLSs) in device dielectrics and interfaces, yet isolating individual defects typically relies on tuning the qubit or the TLS into resonance. We demonstrate a novel spectroscopy method for fixed-frequency transmons based on multilevel relaxation: repeated preparation of the second excited state and simultaneous $T_1$ extraction of the first and second excited states reveals characteristic correlations in the decay rates of adjacent transitions. From these correlations we identify one or more dominant TLSs and reconstruct their frequency drift over time. Remarkably, we find that TLSs detuned by $\gtrsim 100\,\mathrm{MHz}$ from the qubit transition can still significantly influence relaxation. The proposed method provides a powerful tool for TLS spectroscopy without the need to tune the transmon frequency, either via a flux-tunable inductor or AC-Stark shifts.

Abstract: As collective states of animal groups go, swarms of midge insects pose a number of puzzling questions. Their ordering polarization parameter is quite small and the insects are weakly coupled among themselves but strongly coupled to the swarm. In laboratory studies (free of external perturbations), the correlation length is small, whereas midge swarms exhibit strong correlations, scale free behavior and power laws for correlation length, susceptibility and correlation time in field studies. Data for the dynamic correlation function versus time collapse to a single curve only for small values of time scaled with the correlation time. Is there a theory that explains these disparate observations? Among the existing theories, whodunnit? Here we review and discuss several models proposed in the literature and extend our own one, the harmonically confined Vicsek model, to anisotropic confinement. Numerical simulations of the latter produce elongated swarm shapes and values of the static critical exponents between those of the two dimensional and isotropic three dimensional models. The new values agree better with those measured in natural swarms.

Abstract: Thermodynamic cycles are idealized processes that can convert heat into work or produce heat flow against a temperature gradient with the input of work. They remain an active area of research in modern stochastic thermodynamics. In particular, cyclic active heat engines have been shown to display a rich phenomenology, such as ``violations'' of the Carnot bound on efficiency and an improved performance in comparison to their passive counterparts. We introduce the concept of cyclic active refrigerators using a previously derived second law for cyclic active systems. We show that for cyclic active refrigerators, a naive definition of the coefficient of performance can exceed the bound set by the standard second law for passive refrigerators. We also show that cyclic active systems can behave like a Maxwell's demon, with heat flowing from the cold to the hot reservoir without any work input. Beyond this phase, cyclic active systems can enter a hybrid phase, functioning as both a heat engine and a refrigerator simultaneously. Our results are obtained with two models that involve active Brownian particles, a simpler one that allows for analytical results and a more realistic one that is analyzed through numerical simulations.

Abstract: Biological sensory systems, from \textit{E.~coli} chemotaxis to sensory neurons in \textit{C.~elegans}, achieve reliable adaptation over wide dynamic ranges despite operating in strongly noisy and overdamped regimes. Here, we present a field-theoretic framework in which sensory adaptation emerges from a variational free-energy principle, formulated as a stochastic differential game between an organism and its environment. Using an Onsager--Machlup path-integral formalism, we show that the resulting adaptive dynamics are mathematically equivalent to a class of model reference adaptive control schemes and can be interpreted as a dynamic renormalization of the system's Green's function. Within this framework, the phasic overshoot commonly observed in sensory responses arises naturally from an effective inertia ($m^* \approx τγ$) generated by memory-dissipation coupling, rather than from biochemical fine-tuning. Quantitative fits to experimental data across species yield $R^2 > 0.88$, and indicate that adaptive sensory processing operates within a narrow thermodynamically optimal regime bounded by signal-to-noise and stability constraints.

Abstract: We investigate scaling and universality in nonequilibrium spin correlation functions in the presence of uncorrelated noise. In the absence of noise, spin correlation functions exhibit a crossover from monotonic decay at fast sweep velocities to oscillatory behavior at slow sweeps. We show that, under a stochastically driven field, the critical sweep velocity at which the spin correlation functions undergo an abrupt change decreases with increasing noise strength and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. Remarkably, when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are comparable, the excitation probability becomes locked to pk = 1/2 over a finite momentum window, signaling the emergence of noise-induced maximally mixed modes. This gives rise to a highly oscillatory region in the dynamical phase diagram, whose threshold sweep velocity increases with noise and likewise exhibits quadratic scaling with the noise strength. Finally, we identify a universal scaling function under which all boundary sweep-velocity curves collapse onto a single universal curve.

Abstract: Ion transport through charged nanopores is commonly interpreted in terms of electrical double layer structure, leading to the expectation of cation-selective conduction in negatively charged pores. This picture can break down for multivalent electrolytes, where strong ion-urface correlations and charge inversion modify transport behavior. Here, we study NaCl and CaCl$_2$ conduction through negatively charged silica nanopores using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with scaled-charge ion models. By separating concentration and velocity contributions to the radial particle current density, we connect static adsorption to dynamic perm-selectivity. While NaCl exhibits conventional cation selectivity, CaCl$_2$ shows nearly bulk-like or even anion-favored transport due to Ca$^{2+}$ immobilization near the surface and dominant Cl$^-$ conduction in the pore interior following charge inversion. Although this qualitative mechanism is robust, its detailed manifestation depends sensitively on the balance of ion-surface and ion-water interactions encoded in the force field.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to offer an analytic theory of the shear banding instability in amorphous solids that are subjected to athermal quasi-static shear. To this aim we derive nonlinear equations for the displacement field, including the consequences of plastic deformation on the mechanical response of amorphous solids. The plastic events collectively induce distributed dipoles that are responsible for screening effects and the creation of typical length-scales that are absent in classical elasticity theory. The nonlinear theory exposes an instability that results in the creation of shear bands. By solving the weakly nonlinear amplitude equation we present analytic expressions for the displacement fields that is associated with shear bands, explaining the role of the elastic moduli that determine the width of a shear band from ductile to brittle characteristics. We derive an energy functional whose Hessian possesses an eigenvalue that goes to zero at the shear-banding instability, providing a prediction for the critical value of the accumulated stress that results in an instability.

Abstract: Reciprocity is a fundamental symmetry present in many natural phenomena and engineered systems. Distinct situations where this symmetry is broken are typically grouped under the umbrella term "nonreciprocity", colloquially defined by: the action of A on B $\neq$ the action of B on A. In this review, we elucidate what nonreciprocity is by providing an introduction to its most salient classes: nonvariational dynamics, violations of Newton's third law, broken detailed balance, nonreciprocal responses and nonreciprocity of arbitrary linear operators. Next, we point out where to find these manifestations of non-reciprocity, from ensembles of particles with field mediated interactions to synthetic neural networks and open quantum systems. Given this breadth of contexts and the lack of an all-encompassing definition, it makes it all the more intriguing that some general conclusions can be gathered, when distinct definitions of nonreciprocity overlap. We explore what these universal consequences are with a special emphasis on collective phenomena that arise in nonreciprocal many-body systems. The topics covered include nonreciprocal phase transitions and non-normal amplification of noise and perturbations. We conclude with some open questions.
