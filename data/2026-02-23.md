Abstract: Strontium titanate ($\mathrm{SrTiO_3, STO}$) dome-shaped superconducting transition temperature as a function of chemical potential, consistent with STO experiments, and shows that tunable s-wave and d-wave symmetries are modulated by doping. Superconducting fluctuations validate the mean-field approximation at low temperatures but destroy pairing at higher temperatures. The charge-density-wave order competes with superconductivity, enhances the effective electron mass inversely with the chemical potential, and increases with the interaction strength $U$ and the temperature $T$. SDW order is rare and fragile, while an additional magnetic term induces subtle band splitting. These findings suggest e-e contributions to STO's transport anomalies and provide criteria to distinguish e-e from e-ph origins, offering insights for engineering higher $T_c$ in dilute systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) governs lattice dynamics, charge transport, and collective electronic phases in quantum materials. In several families of unconventional superconductors, including transition-metal dichalcogenides and kagome metals, growing evidence points to a cooperative role of EPC and dynamic charge-density fluctuations (CDF) in stabilizing superconductivity. However, how the EPC strength evolves across phase diagrams and relates to superconducting properties in strongly correlated systems remains an open question. Here we investigate the interplay between phonons and the CDF recently identified in cuprate superconductors. Using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we track the dispersion and intensity of bond-stretching phonons in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ over wide ranges of doping, temperature, and momentum. We find that both the phonon softening at the CDF wave vector and the EPC strength, extracted from a pronounced phonon intensity anomaly, are maximized near $p = 0.19$, where superconducting properties are optimal and CDF intensity is strongest. These results identify dynamic charge-density fluctuations, rather than quasi-static charge density waves, as the dominant source of phonon renormalization in cuprates, and establish a direct correlation between EPC strength and the superconducting dome. More broadly, our measurements highlight EPC as a doping-dependent property of correlated materials, shaped by the electronic environment in which lattice vibrations are embedded.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Magnetic flux (vortex) trapping remains a major obstacle to very large scale integration in superconducting electronics. Moats -- etched regions in circuit layers placed in ground planes and around critical circuitry -- offer a simple passive approach to sequester flux. Here, we systematically examine the effectiveness of moat arrays in superconducting niobium films as a function of geometry (size, shape, and density) and background magnetic field. By measuring the vortex expulsion field, we estimate the flux saturation number and flux trapping temperature for a range of geometries. We find that many moat designs effectively sequester flux in magnetically shielded environments (< 1 $μ$T), with high-aspect-ratio rectangular "slit" moats providing the strongest mitigation at minimal area cost. However, our measurements show that moats alone do not eliminate flux trapping in non-ideal films, as vortices can preferentially pin at material defects. These results provide design guidance for flux mitigation in superconducting integrated circuits and highlight the need for combined optimization of circuit geometries and materials.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Spin relaxometry using fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) has been applied successfully to sense numerous paramagnetic target molecules such as free radicals and metalloproteins. However, despite their high sensitivity, T1 spin relaxation measurements are often hampered by their slow acquisition speed. Here, we demonstrate a method that allows for real-time monitoring of paramagnetic chemical reactions. We demonstrate T1 spin relaxometry from thousands of FNDs using an optimised cuvette-based system integrating an avalanche photodiode operated in linear mode, and a fast, fieldprogrammable gate array (FPGA) for data collation. We demonstrate chemical monitoring of the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) ions in-solution with a 15 second integration using an optimised T1 sensing protocol. Our method achieves more than two orders of magnitude speed up with an order of magnitude reduction in cost when compared with traditional techniques. With further technical improvements, we believe this in-solution method could be extended to sense the sub-second chemical kinetics of paramagnetic molecules in solution.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We demonstrate, by femtosecond time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that photoinduced interlayer charge transfer in a heterostructure consisting of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene and a single atomic layer of silver on 6H-SiC(0001) transiently modulates the intrinsic potential landscape across the silver-graphene interface. This acts as an ultrafast optoelectronic gate that drives momentum-dependent band renormalizations, resulting in a transient band-gap opening on femtosecond timescales. Simultaneously, the photogenerated hot-carrier population enhances electronic screening, leading to subsequent closing of the band-gap beyond the thermal equilibrium value. These findings reveal two different mechanisms for photoinduced, reversible control of the electronic band structure in bilayer graphene -- interlayer charge transfer and hot-carrier-enhanced screening -- providing a general framework for the ultrafast control of electronic properties in graphene-based heterostructures. This opens up novel pathways for the realization of ultrafast optoelectronic devices and the exploration of correlated quantum phases in bilayer graphene under non-equilibrium conditions.

Abstract: Understanding the fine structure of excitons is crucial for optoelectronic and quantum photonic applications of lead halide perovskites. It is demonstrated that polarization-sensitive photon echo spectroscopy in magnetic field provides a powerful method to access coherent exciton dynamics and reveal their energy level structure, which is hidden by inhomogeneous broadening. Exciton quantum beats observed in both Faraday and Voigt geometries offer a precise probe of the energy splittings among the four 1$s$ exciton states, enabling determination of the fine structure and bright-dark splittings. Application of this technique to bulk mixed halide perovskite crystals FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ reveals a bright-dark exciton splitting of $Δ_\mathrm{X}=0.46~$meV, along with electron and hole Landé $g$ factors $g_\mathrm{e}=3.38$ and $g_\mathrm{h}=-1.14$, respectively. The quantum beats persist on timescales of 20--50$~$ps, demonstrating remarkably robust spin and optical coherences at cryogenic temperature of 2$~$K. The decay of the quantum beats of the outer doublet is governed by dephasing due to dispersion of the bright-dark splitting of $\sim0.06~$meV caused by localization potential fluctuations, while dephasing in the bright exciton inner doublet originates from a small zero field splitting of $\sim0.035~$meV due to anisotropic potentials.

Abstract: Swift electrons from highly focused beams produced in aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopes offer a powerful route for probing and manipulating matter at the nanoscale. Although linear momentum transfer from swift electrons to nanoparticles has been investigated theoretically and experimentally, subsequent analyzes revealed that several earlier predictions relied on non-causal dielectric functions or insufficient numerical convergence, leading to spurious sign reversals in the transferred momentum. Here, we derive analytical expressions and develop a numerically efficient electrodynamic framework to compute the linear momentum transferred from a swift electron to an isolated spherical nanoparticle described by a fully causal, local dielectric response. We apply our framework to large nanoparticles with 50 nm radius and explicitly resolve the spectral density of linear momentum transfer across the full frequency domain. Using causal dielectric functions for aluminum and bismuth, we analyze the role of electron velocity, impact parameter, and material-specific resonances. We find that, when causality and full multipolar convergence are enforced, the net transverse linear momentum transferred to spherical nanoparticles remains attractive toward the electron trajectory for all nanoparticles considered, despite the presence of material-dependent sign changes in individual electric and magnetic contributions. These results contrast with earlier theoretical predictions of net repulsive behavior and indicate that additional physical mechanisms beyond the present isolated, local description are required to account for experimentally observed repulsion. Our work establishes a robust reference framework for momentum transfer calculations and provides quantitative benchmarks relevant for electron-beam-based nanoscale manipulation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators are central to our understanding of the connection between topological symmetries in a material and its band electronics. Within this class of materials, a breadth of complex quantum behaviors, such as persistent spin-polarized current states in the presence of a broken time reversal symmetry, and temperature-independent topological protection of quantum states, are thought to exist. However, current studies using photoemission and spectroscopic analyses or transport experiments fail to provide insight into the interplay between the physical 2D manifold and the band topology itself, since they do not provide spatial resolution of the phenomena to be understood. In this work, we develop a methodology for applying magnetic force microscopy to such systems to address this issue. Using well-characterized 2D crystallites of bismuth telluride ($Bi_2$$Te_3$), we image the magnetic signal directly associated with topological edge states. The observed phase contrast is remarkably robust at a temperature of 25°C and occurs across crystallite sizes and shapes. A detailed analysis of the magnetic imaging suggests that the current observed is composed of two parts: the first is a persistent current ($I_{Persistent}$) as predicted by theory, and the second is due to Faraday induction, $I_{Faraday}$. Damping dynamics of the cantilever during imaging further suggest that this Faraday EMF is established by spin accumulation along the 1D edge channel of the crystal, which then converts to a charge current in the presence of time reversal symmetry breaking, creating a novel form of rectification in the channel. This unexpected result can prompt new ideas for topology-based circuit elements with extremely low losses and power consumption.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSs) can display unconventional quasiparticle dynamics and charge transport properties due to their extended band degeneracy and the peculiar geometry of their Fermi surface. We consider electron-acoustic phonon scattering as the dominant relaxation mechanism and compute the quasiparticle decay rate and dc conductivity by solving the linearized semiclassical Boltzmann equation in a minimal model of a doped circular NLS. We find that the toroidal geometry of the Fermi surface gives rise to two parametrically distinct Bloch-Grüneisen temperatures, associated with momentum transfers along the poloidal and toroidal directions, respectively. As a result, an intermediate temperature window opens between these two scales, in which the decay rate follows $Γ\propto T^2$, while the conductivity follows $σ\propto T^{-2}$. We also obtain the low- and high-temperature asymptotic behaviors, and discuss implications for ARPES and transport measurements in candidate NLS materials.

Abstract: A decision diagram (DD) is a graph-like data structure for homomorphic compression of Boolean and pseudo-Boolean functions. Over the past decades, decision diagrams have been successfully applied to verification, linear algebra, stochastic reasoning, and quantum circuit analysis. Floating-point errors have, however, significantly slowed down practical implementations of real- and complex-valued decision diagrams. In the context of quantum computing, attempts to mitigate this numerical instability have thus far lacked theoretical scaling guarantees and have had only limited success in practice. Here, we focus on the analysis of quantum circuits consisting of Clifford gates and $T$ gates (a common universal gate set). We first hand-craft an algebraic representation for complex numbers, which replace the floating point coefficients in a decision diagram. Then, we prove that the sizes of these algebraic representations are linearly bounded in the number of $T$ gates and qubits, and constant in the number of Clifford gates. Furthermore, we prove that both the runtime and the number of nodes of decision diagrams are upper bounded as $2^t \cdot poly(g, n)$, where $t$ ($g$) is the number of $t$ gates (Clifford gates) and $n$ the number of qubits. Our proofs are based on a $T$-count dependent characterization of the density matrix entries of quantum states produced by circuits with Clifford+$T$ gates, and uncover a connection between a quantum state's stabilizer nullity and its decision diagram width. With an open source implementation, we demonstrate that our exact method resolves the inaccuracies occurring in floating-point-based counterparts and can outperform them due to lower node counts. Our contributions are, to the best of our knowledge, the first scaling guarantees on the runtime of (exact) quantum decision diagram simulation for a universal gate set.

Abstract: We consider the quantum Zeno dynamics arising from monitoring a time-dependent projector. Starting from a stroboscopic measurement protocol, it is shown that the effective Hamiltonian for Zeno dynamics involves a nonadiabatic geometric connection that takes the form of the Kato-Avron Hamiltonian for parallel transport, stirring the evolution within the time-dependent Zeno subspace. The latter reduces to counterdiabatic driving when projective measurements are performed in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis of the quantum system. The effective Zeno Hamiltonian can also be derived in the context of continuous quantum measurements of a time-dependent observable and the non-Hermitian evolution with a complex absorbing potential varying in time. Our results thus provide a unified framework for realizing shortcuts to adiabaticity via adaptive quantum Zeno measurements.

Abstract: Quantum information processing relies on a variety of resources, including entanglement, coherence, non-Gaussianity, and magic. In realistic settings, protocols run on networks of parties with heterogeneous local resource constraints, so different resources coexist and interact. Yet, resource theories have mostly treated each resource in isolation, and a general theory for manipulation in such distributed settings has been lacking. We develop a unified framework for composite quantum resource theories that describes distributed networks of locally constrained parties. We formulate natural axioms a composite theory should satisfy to respect the local structure, and from these axioms derive fundamental bounds on resource manipulation that hold universally, independent of the particular network characteristics. We apply our results to central operational tasks, including resource conversion and assisted distillation, and introduce new methods to construct new resource monotones from this setup. Our framework further reveals previously unexplored phenomena in the remote certification of quantum resources. Together, these results establish foundational laws for distributed quantum resource manipulation across diverse physical platforms.

Abstract: Quantum simulation of many-body systems offers a powerful approach to exploring collective quantum dynamics beyond classical computational reach. Although spin and fermionic models have been extensively simulated on digital quantum computers, the simulation of bosonic systems on programmable quantum processors is often hindered by the intrinsically large Hilbert space of bosonic modes. In this work, we study the digital quantum simulation of bosonic modes using the Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation and implement this protocol on a cloud-based superconducting quantum processor. Two representative models are realized on quantum hardware: (i) the driven harmonic oscillator and (ii) the Jaynes-Cummings model. Using data obtained from the quantum simulations, we systematically examine the interplay between algorithmic and hardware-induced errors to identify optimal simulation parameters. The dominant algorithmic errors arise from the finite number of qubits used in the HP mapping and the finite number of Trotter steps in the time evolution, while hardware errors mainly originate from gate infidelity, decoherence, and readout errors. This study advances the digital quantum simulation of many-body systems involving bosonic degrees of freedom on currently available cloud quantum processors and provides a framework that can be extended to more complex spin-boson and multimode cavity models.

Abstract: Quantum metrology of an incoherent signal is a canonical sensing problem related to superresolution and noise spectroscopy. We show that quantum computing can accelerate searches for a weak incoherent signal when the signal and noise are not precisely known. In particular, we consider weak Schur sampling, density matrix exponentiation, and quantum signal processing for testing the rank, purity, and spectral gap of the unknown quantum state to detect the incoherent signal. We show that these algorithms are faster than full-state tomography, which scales with the dimension of the Hilbert space. We apply our results to detecting exoplanets, stochastic gravitational waves, ultralight dark matter, geontropic quantum gravity, and Pauli noise.

Abstract: Gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots utilize fast electrical control to manipulate spin and charge states of individual electrons. Electrical pulse distortions can limit control fidelities but are difficult to measure at the device level. Here, we use detuning-axis pulsed spectroscopy to characterize baseband pulse distortions in a silicon double quantum-dot. We extract the gate-voltage impulse response and apply a digital pre-distortion filter to eliminate pulse distortions on timescales longer than 1~ns. With the pre-distortion, we reduce the frequency chirp of coherent exchange oscillations in a singlet-triplet qubit. Our results suggest a scalable and tuning-efficient method for characterizing pulse distortions in quantum-dot spin qubits.

Abstract: A new generation of global communications technology has been emerging. These systems, which utilize established device technologies and quantum effect devices, require ultra-high speeds, low cost, and strong security. In recent years, global communication systems have faced various practical security challenges depending on their configurations, and research efforts are underway to address these issues. In particular, the issue of the security of physical layer security from microwave wireless systems to quantum optical communication systems is urgent problem. However, concepts of cryptographic schemes have also been diversifying. Typical examples are mathematical ciphers, the Wyner scheme and QKD. Then, the Y-00 protocol has recently emerged as a third pillar cryptographic technology in the optical quantum domain. These security principles differ significantly from one another. This makes it difficult for different fields to understand each other. At this stage, comparative explanations of the security principles underlying these various cryptographic technologies are likely to promote mutual understanding among researchers across different fields. As the first trial, this lecture note explains the security mechanism of the third pillar (Y-00), comparing it with the principles of other mechanisms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Distributing qubits across quantum processing units (QPUs) connected by shared entanglement enables scaling beyond monolithic architectures. Hyperbolic Floquet codes use only weight-2 measurements and are good candidates for distributed quantum error correcting codes. We construct hyperbolic and semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes from $\{8,3\}$, $\{10,3\}$, and $\{12,3\}$ tessellations via the Wythoff kaleidoscopic construction with the Low-Index Normal Subgroups (LINS) algorithm and distribute them across QPUs via spectral bisection. The $\{10,3\}$ and $\{12,3\}$ families are new to hyperbolic Floquet codes.
  We simulate these distributed codes under four noise models: depolarizing, SDEM3, correlated EM3, and erasure. With depolarizing noise ($p_{\text{local}} = 0.03\%$), fine-grained codes achieve non-local pseudo-thresholds up to 3.0\% for $\{8,3\}$, 3.0\% for $\{10,3\}$, and 1.75\% for $\{12,3\}$. Correlated EM3 yields pseudo-thresholds up to 0.75\% for $\{8,3\}$, 0.75\% for $\{10,3\}$, and 0.50\% for $\{12,3\}$; crossing-based thresholds from same-$k$ families are ${\sim}1.75$--$2.9\%$ across all tessellations. Using the SDEM3 model, fine-grained codes achieve distributed pseudo-thresholds of 1.75\% for $\{8,3\}$, 1.25\% for $\{10,3\}$, and 1.00\% for $\{12,3\}$. Under erasure noise motivated by spin-optical architectures, thresholds at 1\% local loss are 35--40\% for $\{8,3\}$, 30--35\% for $\{10,3\}$, and 25--30\% for $\{12,3\}$.

Abstract: Quantum chaos is commonly assessed through probe-dependent signatures such as spectral statistics, OTOCs, and entanglement growth, which need not coincide. Recently, a dissipative diagnostic of chaos has been proposed, in which an infinitesimal coupling to a bath yields a finite Liouvillian gap in chaotic systems, marking the onset of intrinsic relaxation. This raises a conceptual question: what is the minimal departure from Clifford dynamics needed for this intrinsically relaxing behavior to emerge? In this work, we investigate the dynamics under the Floquet two-qubit Clifford circuit interleaved with a finite density of Haar-random single-site gates, followed by a depolarizing channel with strength $γ$. For Floquet Clifford circuits built from an \textit{i}SWAP-class two-qubit gate, our analysis identifies two distinct regimes for the Liouvillian gap in the thermodynamic limit, exemplified by the undoped and fully doped extreme cases. In both regimes, the dissipative diagnostic signals chaotic behavior, differing only in how the gap scales with system size. In the undoped circuit, the gap scales as $Δ\sim γN$, whereas in the fully doped circuit it remains finite as $N\to\infty$. We find that the doping density $p_h$ governs the crossover: as $p_h\to 0$, any spatial structure remains undoped-like, whereas for finite $p_h$ certain structures can enter a finite-gap regime. These results are analytically established in the strongly dissipative regime $γ\gg 1$ by deriving lower bounds on the gap as a function of $p_h$ and explicit finite-gap constructions, and their extension toward $γ\to 0$ is supported by numerics. Importantly, our analytic treatment depends only on the spatial doping structure, so the same gap scaling persists even when the Haar rotations are independently resampled each Floquet period.

Abstract: The Hadamard product of two tensors in the tensor-train (TT) format is a fundamental operation across various applications, such as TT-based function multiplication for nonlinear differential equations or convolutions. However, conventional methods for computing this product typically scale as at least $\mathcal{O}(χ^4)$ with respect to the TT bond dimension (TT-rank) $χ$, creating a severe computational bottleneck in practice. By combining randomized tensor-train sketching with slice selection via interpolative decomposition, we introduce Recursive Sketched Interpolation (RSI), a ``scale product'' algorithm that computes the Hadamard product of TTs at a computational cost of $\mathcal{O}(χ^3)$. Benchmarks across various TT scenarios demonstrate that RSI offers superior scalability compared to traditional methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. We generalize RSI to compute more complex operations, including Hadamard products of multiple TTs and other element-wise nonlinear mappings, without increasing the complexity beyond $\mathcal{O}(χ^3)$.

Abstract: We generalize the information lattice, originally defined for one-dimensional open-boundary chains, to characterize quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries. In one dimension, the information lattice provides a position- and scale-resolved decomposition of von Neumann information. Its generalization is nontrivial because overlapping subsystems can form loops, allowing multiple regions to encode the same information. This prevents information from being assigned uniquely to any one of them. We address this by introducing a higher-dimensional information lattice in which local information is defined through an inclusion-exclusion principle. The inclusion-exclusion local information is assigned to the lattice vertices, each labeled by subsystem position and scale. We implement this construction explicitly in two dimensions and apply it to a range of many-body ground states with distinct entanglement structures. Within this position- and scale-resolved framework, we extract information-based localization lengths, direction-dependent critical exponents, characteristic edge mode information, long-range information patterns due to topological order, and signatures of non-Abelian fusion channels. Our work establishes a general information-theoretic framework for isolating the universal scale-resolved features of quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries.

Abstract: The steady-state quantum dynamics of three dipole-dipole coupled two-level emitters, fixed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, and interacting via the environmental thermostat is investigated. We have analytically obtained the populations of the involved three-atom cooperative states as well as of the second- and third-order spatial photon correlation functions of the light scattered by the few-qubit sample. As a consequence, we have demonstrated that this incoherently excited system spontaneously generates streams of single photons possessing sub-Poissonian photon statistics. In analogy to the dipole-dipole blockade, one may expect that at smaller inter particle distances, compared to the photon emission wavelength, the reported phenomenon has the same origin. However, we have shown that the quantum photon features are due to the interaction's nature of the few symmetrically arranged two-level emitters with the surrounding thermal reservoir. Respectively, at larger atomic intervals the effect occurs because of high-order spatial interference phenomena. Sub-wavelength interference fringes can be observed too, via measurements of spatial higher-order photon correlation functions.

Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computation with Rydberg atoms provides a natural route for solving combinatorial optimization problems such as the maximum independent set (MIS). However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the reduction of the spectral gap with increasing system size and connectivity, which induces population leakage from the ground state during finite-time evolution. Here we introduce the Adjusted Detuning for Ground-Energy Leakage Blockade (ADGLB), a spectral-gap-guided schedule engineering method that modifies the laser detuning profile to suppress leakage without introducing additional Hamiltonian terms or iterative optimization loops. We experimentally benchmark ADGLB on a quasi-one-dimensional chain of $N=10$ atoms, and the MIS preparation probability increases substantially compared with the standard adiabatic schedule. Furthermore, we show that the schedule optimized for smaller instances can be directly applied to larger two-dimensional triangular lattices with $N=25$ and $N=37$. With a small heuristic offset, the method also remains effective for instances with higher hardness parameters. These findings demonstrate that spectral-gap-guided schedule engineering offers a scalable and hardware-efficient strategy for enhancing adiabatic quantum optimization on neutral-atom platforms.

Abstract: We present a method to conduct both quantum state reconstruction and entanglement purification simultaneously that is advantageous in several respects over previous work in this direction, showing that the number of Bell pairs necessary to boot a quantum network can be significantly reduced compared to an existing method. The existing method requires at least $10^5$ Bell pairs for the state reconstruction phase to estimate that the state is of fidelity $0.99$ within the error range of $10^{-2}$, whereas our approach only requires around $2,841$ to be certain with $99.7\%$ of confidence that the estimated fidelity lies within $[0.99-0.01, 0.99+0.01]$. In addition, in our approach we can start with a lower fidelity Bell pair and purify it multiple times, estimating at the same time the resultant fidelity with guarantee of $99.7\%$ that the fidelity estimate lies within a certain range. Moreover, the existing method cannot correct both bit-flip and phase-flip errors at the same time and can only correct one of these, whereas our approach can correct both bit-flip and phase-flip errors simultaneously. This research produces numerical estimates for the number of Bell pairs actually needed to guarantee a certain threshold fidelity $F$. The research can support the functioning real-world quantum networking by providing the information of the time needed for the bootstrapping of a quantum network to finish.

Abstract: Mahadev [SIAM J. Comput. 2022] introduced the first protocol for classical verification of quantum computation based on the Learning-with-Errors (LWE) assumption, achieving a 4-message interactive scheme. This breakthrough naturally raised the question of whether fewer messages are possible in the plain model. Despite its importance, this question has remained unresolved.
  In this work, we prove that there is no quantum black-box reduction of non-interactive classical verification of quantum computation of $\textsf{QMA}$ to any falsifiable assumption. Here, "non-interactive" means that after an instance-independent setup, the protocol consists of a single message. This constitutes a strong negative result given that falsifiable assumptions cover almost all standard assumptions used in cryptography, including LWE. Our separation holds under the existence of a $\textsf{QMA} \text{-} \textsf{QCMA}$ gap problem. Essentially, these problems require a slightly stronger assumption than $\textsf{QMA}\neq \textsf{QCMA}$. To support the existence of such problems, we present a construction relative to a quantum unitary oracle.

Abstract: Standard quantum state tomography assumes sufficient control of a system to measure an informationally complete set of observables. Dynamical quantum state tomography (DQST) presents an alternative: given a system with known dynamics and a single fixed observable, it almost always suffices to control only the time at which each i.i.d. copy of the system is measured. This work presents an analogous scheme for tomography of multi-mode Bosonic Gaussian states undergoing Gaussian evolution, using a fixed single-mode homodyne measurement and only assuming control of the time of measurement. I prove that the scheme enables tomography for all discrete homogenous Gaussian evolutions and Gaussian quantum dynamical semigroups except for a null set which includes unitary evolution. When the state is known to be pure, a smaller number of measurement times is shown to be sufficient.

Abstract: Defects in solid-state systems constitute a promising platform for the realization of deterministic quantum emitters. Among many candidate materials and emitters, point defects in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) have recently emerged as particularly promising. In this work, we probe the coherence of an individual B center with a zero phonon line at 436 nm, under pulsed resonant excitation. We observe power-dependent Rabi oscillations up to 5π, demonstrating optical coherent control of the transition. We achieve an excellent single photon purity of 93% at π-pulse. Furthermore, we probe the coherence of the two-level system using Ramsey interferometry, revealing an inhomogeneous coherence time of T_2*=0.60 ns. These results establish B centers in hBN as viable candidates for triggered, coherent quantum emitters and represent an important step towards their integration into quantum photonic platforms.

Abstract: The ability to establish coherent communication channels is key for scaling up quantum devices. Here, we engineer interactions between distant polaritons, hybrid spin-photon excitations formed at different lumped-element superconducting resonators within a chip. The chip consists of several resonator pairs, slightly detuned in frequency to make them addressable, capacitively coupled within each pair and inductively coupled to a common readout line. They interact locally with samples of PTMr and Tripak$^{-}$ organic free radicals, deposited onto their inductors, which provide model $S = 1/2$, $g \simeq 2$ spin ensembles. Frequency-dependent microwave transmission experiments, performed at very low temperatures, measure polariton frequencies as a function of magnetic field in different scenarios. When only one resonator within a pair hosts a molecular sample, the results evidence that spins couple remotely to the empty LER as well as to the local cavity mode. If both resonators interact with a spin ensemble, the magnetic field tunes the polariton frequencies relative to each other, on account of the different spin-photon interactions at each LER. When polaritons are brought into mutual resonance, an avoided level crossing emerges that gives direct spectroscopic evidence for a coherent polariton-polariton interaction mediated by the circuit. Pump-probe experiments reveal that the excitation of a polariton within a connected pair is felt, thus it can be read out, by the other one. These observations, backed by model calculations, illustrate the control and detection of distant photon-photon and spin-spin correlations and entanglement in a scalable modular chip.

Abstract: Resonant laser excitation of a two-level system with subsequent single-photon emission can be used to generate single photons with high indistinguishability or Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) visibility. However, spectral overlap between excitation laser and emitted photons generally poses significant challenges. Furthermore, emitter re-excitation intrinsically limits achievable single-photon purity. Established solutions mitigate these issues at significant cost to source efficiency and with increased source complexity. This motivates the use of few-level systems with spectral separation of excitation and emission pathways. One option is a three-level cascade. However, without targeted lifetime engineering of emitting states, the cascade naturally limits achievable photon indistinguishability. Here we study a semiconductor quantum dot with resonant and selective cavity-enhancement of biexciton-to-exciton transition. Following resonant two-photon excitation of the biexciton state, we collect the emitted single photon with the cavity. This approach circumvents emitter re-excitation and naturally introduces spectral separation of excitation laser and emitted single photon. Supported by first experimental results, we demonstrate theoretically that with selective Purcell enhancement, the observed quality quantifiers of single-photon emission (purity, equivalently $g^{(2)}(0)$, and HOM visibility $\mathcal{V}$, equivalently indistinguishability) are competitive with respect to high-quality deterministic quantum-dot single-photon sources. This is already achieved without systematic optimization or targeted system engineering, which firmly places the reported approach as a viable route to the next generation of highest-quality quantum-dot based deterministic single-photon sources.

Abstract: The dynamical consequences of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) remain largely unexplored despite extensive studies of its static properties. Here we address this gap by applying quantum Liang information flow (QLIF) an inherently directional measure of causal influence to the nonHermitian Su Schrieffer Heeger model with non reciprocal hopping. Unlike symmetric correlation functions, QLIF directly captures the directional asymmetry characteristic of non reciprocal systems. We demonstrate a scissors effect where the asymmetry varies approximately linearly with the non-reciprocity parameter gamma for small gamma, and exhibits non-monotonic dependence on the skin length, with optimal asymmetry at moderate skin localization. The velocity ordering reveals NHSE-induced blocking of information flow against the skin direction. Three distinct temporal regimes emerge: light-cone-bounded spreading, gamma-dependent stabilization, and coherent oscillations. These results establish the first quantitative connection between static skin localization and directional information dynamics, offering new insights into information propagation in non-reciprocal quantum systems.

Abstract: We investigate the operation of a qubit as a quantum thermal device within the repeated interaction framework, allowing for strong system-bath coupling and finite interaction times. We analyze two minimal models: an alternating-coupling setup, in which the qubit sequentially interacts with hot and cold baths, and a simultaneous-coupling setup, where both baths interact with the qubit during each collision. For the alternating model, we obtain an exact analytical solution for the limit-cycle state, valid for arbitrary coupling strengths and collision durations. Using this solution, we rigorously prove a no-go theorem for quantum refrigeration. We further demonstrate that, although work can be generated locally at individual system-bath contacts, the total work over a cycle is always nonpositive, precluding engine operation. In the absence of work, the model describes pure heat conduction, for which we derive a closed-form expression for the heat current and show that it exhibits a nonmonotonic turnover behavior. The simultaneous-coupling model is analyzed perturbatively. In the short-collision-time limit, it reproduces the same steady-state behavior as the alternating model, reinforcing the generality of the constraints identified. Our results establish fundamental limitations on qubit-based quantum thermal machines operating under Markovian repeated interactions and highlight the need for enriched models to realize functional quantum thermal devices.

Abstract: Universal control of bosonic degrees of freedom provides a hardware-efficient route for quantum information processing with high-dimensional systems. Bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED), which leverages transmon ancillae to coherently control long-lived superconducting cavities, is well suited to this goal. However, the cavity transitions are nearly degenerate in the usual dispersive regime, which limits the direct addressability of individual excitation levels and increases the complexity of engineered gates. Here, we integrate an on-chip flux-control architecture with a long-lived bosonic memory housed in a 3D superconducting cavity to dynamically access resonant Jaynes-Cummings (JC) interactions, and realize efficient arbitrary rotations between any pair of Fock levels in the memory. This on-demand access to JC interactions offers a versatile toolbox for implementing robust Fock-basis qudits and harnessing the rich dynamics of high-dimensional bosonic elements for quantum information processing.

In this work, we demonstrate successful synchronization of crystal clocks using weakly time-correlated photons of 180 ns coherence time from a bunched light source. A synchronization timing jitter of 10 ns is achieved over symmetric -102 dB optical channel loss between two parties, over a span of 25 hours. We also present a model that gives better estimates to the coherence peak finding success probabilities under low signal.

Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference is a fundamental tool for assessing photon indistinguishability in quantum information processing. While the effect of chromatic dispersion on HOM interference has been widely studied, the interplay between dispersion and the finite detection window of realistic measurement devices remains under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that the rectangular coincidence window inherent to modern time-tagging modules, which effectively acts as a temporal filter, breaks the standard dispersion cancellation condition and restores sensitivity to symmetric group velocity dispersion. We derive an analytical model for type-II SPDC processes that predicts a modification of the HOM dip shape, specifically the emergence of characteristic oscillations and dip broadening. We experimentally validate this theoretical framework using a ppKTP source and transmission through optical fibers of lengths up to 29 km. The experimental data show excellent agreement with the model, confirming the presence of window-induced oscillations and allowing for the precise extraction of the fiber dispersion parameter. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for finite timing resolution in the design and characterization of dispersive quantum communication links.

Abstract: Quantum metrology seeks to push the boundaries of measurement precision by harnessing quantum phenomena. Conventional methods often rely on maximally entangled resources, with states that are usually challenging to produce and sustain in practical setups. Here, we show that the maximally entangled constraint can be lifted by experimentally realizing a photonic two-qubit weighted graph state with an arbitrarily tunable graph weight. We use the generated state as a resource for quantum-enhanced phase sensing. We experimentally characterize the state and study its minimum estimator variance for two distinct local measurement bases as the graph weight varies from the maximally entangled to weakly entangled limit. We find excellent quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions, and observe a gain in precision beyond the classically attainable precision limit for graph weights substantially below the maximally entangled limit. This confirms that considerably less entanglement is required to achieve a quantum advantage. Albeit non-scalable in our test setup, this work represents the first experimental realization of weighted graph states with a tunable graph weight using linear optics. We expect more scalable versions of the model to be possible in an on-chip photonic platform.

The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs well in both ideal and noisy conditions, enabling high-fidelity teleportation with a reasonable success probability.

We compute the one-shot distillation yield and dilution cost in various operational paradigms, and use them to pin down the extremal additive monotones. In the asymptotic regime, we show that all conversion rates are governed by a single additive monotone, and thereby we establish a universal second law for instability.

Abstract: The fragility of quantum coherence fundamentally limits the scalability of quantum technologies, as unavoidable environmental interactions induce decoherence and rapidly degrade quantum properties. The Quantum Zeno Effect offers a powerful route to suppress quantum evolution and protect coherence through frequent measurements, irrespective of the underlying dynamics. However, existing implementations require prior knowledge of the quantum state, severely restricting their applicability. Here we introduce a state- and dynamics-independent protection protocol embedding the system in a larger Hilbert space, temporarily swapping the quantum information from its original degree of freedom to a decoherence-free ancillary one. We experimentally validate the protocol on a quantum optical platform, demonstrating robust preservation of coherence and purity for arbitrary polarization qubits under decoherence, thereby enabling the universal safeguarding of unknown quantum states.

Abstract: Evaluating the reliability of noisy quantum circuits is essential for implementing quantum algorithms on noisy quantum devices. However, current quantum hardware exhibits diverse noise mechanisms whose compounded effects make accurate and efficient reliability evaluation challenging. While state fidelity is the most faithful indicator of circuit reliability, it is experimentally and computationally prohibitive to obtain. Alternative metrics, although easier to compute, often fail to accurately reflect circuit reliability, lack universality across circuit types, or offer limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained, scalable, and interpretable framework for efficient and accurate reliability evaluation of noisy quantum circuits. Our approach performs a state-independent analysis to model how circuit reliability progressively degrades during execution. We introduce the Noise Proxy Circuit (NPC), which removes all logical operations while preserving the complete sequence of noise channels, thereby providing an abstraction of cumulative noise effects. Based on the NPC, we define Proxy Fidelity, a reliability metric that quantifies both qubit-level and circuit-level reliability. We further develop an analytical algorithm to estimate Proxy Fidelity under depolarizing, thermal relaxation, and readout error channels. The proposed framework achieves fidelity-level reliability estimation while remaining execution-free, scalable, and interpretable. Experimental results show that our method accurately estimates circuit fidelity, with an average absolute difference (AAD) ranging from 0.031 to 0.069 across diverse circuits and devices.

Abstract: We demonstrate the application of a quantum feature extraction method to enhance multi-class image classification for space applications. By harnessing the dynamics of many-body spin Hamiltonians, the method generates expressive quantum features that, when combined with classical processing, lead to quantum-enhanced classification accuracy. Using a strong and well-established ResNet50 baseline, we achieved a maximum classical accuracy of 83%, which can be improved to 84% with a transfer learning approach. In contrast, applying our quantum-classical method the performance is increased to 87% accuracy, demonstrating a clear and reproducible improvement over robust classical approaches. Implemented on several of IBM's quantum processors, our hybrid quantum-classical approach delivers consistent gains of 2-3% in absolute accuracy. These results highlight the practical potential of current and near-term quantum processors in high-stakes, data-driven domains such as satellite imaging and remote sensing, while suggesting broader applicability in real-world machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum photonics have enabled increasingly robust protocols in optical phase estimation, achieving precisions beyond the standard quantum limit and approaching the Heisenberg limit. While intrinsic losses hinder the realization of unconditional super-sensitivity, reaching quantum advantage, defined as sensitivity surpassing that of any classical counterpart with identical resources, remains achievable. Here we experimentally demonstrate such an advantage using a fully fibered Mach-Zehnder-type interferometer operating at telecom wavelengths, free of post-selection. The scheme relies on the conversion of polarization-entangled photon pairs, a degree of freedom commonly favored for experimental convenience, into energy-time entanglement, which is particularly well suited for scalable fiber-based sensors. All system imperfections, including asymmetric losses and detector inefficiencies, are accounted for in the Fisher information analysis, yielding a measured quantum advantage of 10%. This result highlights the practicality of compact, alignment-free quantum interferometers for real-world sensing applications.

Abstract: Deterministic single photon emission from a Rydberg ensemble coupled to an optical cavity requires high-fidelity preparation of collective single excitations. In such a setup imperfect Rydberg blockade can lead to unwanted double excitations, which degrade photon indistinguishability. In this work we adapt the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) technique, originally developed for superconducting qubits, to shape optical pulses that suppress double excitations in this atomic platform. By combining analytical modeling with numerical optimization, DRAG provides an improvement over conventional sine-squared pulses. Further optimization of pulse duration and atomic ensemble size identifies a parameter regime, distinct from that used in [Nature Photonics 17, 688 (2023)], that enhances the single excitation probability from the previous theoretical benchmark of 77% to 91.9%, approaching the fundamental limits set by decoherence in the system. Benchmarking against GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) confirms that DRAG operates close to the optimal control limit, while maintaining smooth, experimentally feasible pulse shapes. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and cross platform adaptability of DRAG for a high-fidelity single photon source.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a general n-qubit formulation of control objectives that allows a control target to be specified in a diagonal frame, so that only the diagonal entries must be characterized, thus quadratically reducing the complexity of the cost functional in constrast to a full target matrix. We do so by representing any n-qubit unitary transformation as a diagonal phase map on the computational basis states, as they are naturally diagonalizable by unitarity. By using discrete derivative operators to analytically construct support-selective phase invariants, we enable to deterministically isolate and quantify any multi-qubit interactions encoded in the phase map. These phase invariants form a coordinate system for the formulation of specific control targets in terms of arbitrary desired multi-qubit interactions, without having to invert the diagonalization during the optimizatiion, solely relying on the experimentally accesible diagonal phases. To illustrate the framework, we synthesize two genuinely tripartite entangling gates, both, diagonal and non-diagonal. These are obtained with a single shaped microwave pulse, for a numerically simulated room-temperature nitrogen-vacancy center with a three qubit nuclear spin register, with durations of about a microsecond. These results represent a factor 10-100 reduction in operation time compared with the fastest existing NV-based entanglers that act on more than two qubits at once.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) have emerged as a promising approach to quantum machine learning, since they utilize the natural dynamics of quantum systems for data processing and are simple to train. Here, we consider n-qubit quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) with continuous-time reservoir dynamics. QELMs are memoryless QRCs capable of various ML tasks, including image classification and time series forecasting. We apply the Pauli transfer matrix (PTM) formalism to theoretically analyze the influence of encoding, reservoir dynamics, and measurement operations, including temporal multiplexing, on the QELM performance. This formalism makes explicit that the encoding determines the complete set of (nonlinear) features available to the QELM, while the quantum channels linearly transform these features before they are probed by the chosen measurement operators. Optimizing a QELM can therefore be cast as a decoding problem in which one shapes the channel-induced transformations such that task-relevant features become available to the regressor. The PTM formalism allows one to identify the classical representation of a QELM and thereby guide its design towards a given training objective. As a specific application, we focus on learning nonlinear dynamical systems and show that a QELM trained on such trajectories learns a surrogate-approximation to the underlying flow map.

Abstract: Frustrated down conversion is a process in which a quantum superposition of emissions from two separate parametric down-conversion processes gives rise to observable interference. Depending on the phase relation between the probability amplitudes associated with emissions by the first and second crystal, the process can be enhanced or suppressed. This is achieved by aligning the setup so that the signal and idler modes from the first crystal are fed into the second and constitute its signal-idler modes.
  In Sci. Adv. 11, 1794 (2025), two-observer interwoven frustrated PDC processes produced interference effects based on path identity [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 080401 (2017)]. The signal and idler modes of source crystals I and II are arranged to fully overlap with the emission modes of crystals A and B, which serve as elements of measurement stations controlled by Alice and Bob. In the interwoven configuration, crystal A (B) receives the signal mode of crystal I (II) and the idler mode of crystal II (I), enabling interference between joint emission processes at the sources and at the measurement stations. It was conjectured that such interference may lead to new non-classical phenomena.
  In arXiv:2508.19207 it was shown that the process violates the standard Clauser-Horne Bell inequality without additional assumptions, provided suitable measurement settings are used. Here we extend the interference scheme to more than two measurement stations and demonstrate a violation of one of the WWWZB inequalities. This indicates that the proposed approach may provide a general method for revealing non-classicality in a range of phenomena discussed in [Rev. Mod. Phys. 94, 025007 (2022)]. We also present a GHZ/Hardy-type argument that further highlights the paradoxical character of the interference.

Abstract: We investigate qubit error bursts in 5- and 7-transmon processors of similar design, fabrication and packaging, but with different types of qubit Josephson junctions. Measurements for each are performed in two refrigerators to discern device-specific from refrigerator-dependent characteristics. The duration and rate of bursts are device specific but within the range of prior experiments and consistent with ionizing radiation. We observe two unforeseen signatures specifically in the processor with Dolan junctions. First, increasing the rate of $π$ pulsing in the detection scheme shortens the recovery time to equilibrium, which is explained by a quasiparticle pumping mechanism. The second signature is an anomalous time dependence in the burst rate: a surge happens days or weeks after cooldown, followed by a strong suppression that persists until thermal cycling.

Abstract: We investigate how quantum localization encodes the hierarchical stickiness that governs transport in mixed classical phase spaces. Using the periodically driven kicked top, we show that the participation ratio (PR) of coherent states in the Floquet eigenbasis resolves the same layered structure that appears classically as a multimodal distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs). To establish a quantitative correspondence, we introduce a Gaussian coarse graining of the FTLE matched to the intrinsic semiclassical resolution of coherent states. Both local correlations and global comparisons of probability distributions demonstrate that quantum and classical indicators agree optimally within a finite window of evolution times, where sticky structures are most clearly resolved. Our results promote the participation ratio from a global measure of chaos to a sensitive probe of hierarchical transport and provide a practical route for diagnosing anomalous localization in driven quantum systems.

Abstract: Scale invariance is a central organizing principle in physics, underlying phenomena that range from critical behaviour in statistical mechanics to transport and chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems. Here we present a unified and physically motivated exploration of scaling concepts, emphasizing how invariance under rescaling transformations emerges across systems of increasing dynamical complexity. Rather than adopting a purely abstract approach, we combine simple geometrical constructions, analytical arguments, and prototypical dynamical models to build physical intuition. We begin with elementary, easily reproducible examples governed by a single control parameter, showing how power-law behaviour naturally arises when characteristic scales are absent. We then extend the discussion to nonlinear dynamical systems exhibiting local bifurcations, where two scaling variables control the relaxation toward stationary states. In this context, scaling invariance manifests through critical exponents, crossover phenomena, and critical slowing down, allowing systems of different dimensionality to be grouped into universality classes. Finally, we address continuous phase transitions in chaotic dynamical systems, including transitions from integrability to non-integrability and from bounded to unbounded diffusion. By drawing on concepts traditionally associated with statistical mechanics, such as order parameters, susceptibilities, symmetry breaking, elementary excitations, and topological defects, we show how these transitions can be interpreted within a coherent scaling framework. Taken together, the examples discussed here demonstrate that scaling invariance provides a unifying language for understanding structure, transport, and criticality in nonlinear systems, bridging deterministic dynamics and nonequilibrium statistical physics in a transparent and physically intuitive manner.

Abstract: Chiral fluids, for which the mobility tensor has antisymmetric, off-diagonal components, exhibit transport phenomena absent in conventional systems, including interaction-enhanced diffusion and negative mobility. While these effects have been predicted theoretically and observed in simulations, their microscopic origin has remained unclear. Here, we address this question using a mobility-based nonequilibrium approach, analysing the steady-state drift of a tracer driven through an interacting chiral fluid. We show that, under strong chirality, the tracer generates a reversed density wake, in which regions of particle accumulation and depletion are inverted compared to the achiral case. This structural inversion of the wake provides a unified physical mechanism underlying both enhanced diffusion and negative mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these phenomena are robust to changes in the interaction potential, highlighting their generality as a consequence of odd mobility.

Abstract: We construct a contour function for the logarithmic negativity and the logarithm of the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix for multimode bosonic Gaussian states of a free lattice model. In one spatial dimension, numerical results are obtained for harmonic chains either in the ground state or at finite temperature, by considering, respectively, either a subsystem made by two adjacent or disjoint blocks on the line or a bipartition of the circle. The contour function of the logarithmic negativity diverges only at the entangling points, while the contour function for the logarithm of the moments of the partial transpose is divergent also at the boundary of the bipartite subsystem, as functions of the position. In a two-dimensional conformal field theory, analytic expressions that describe these divergencies are discussed. In one spatial dimension, we explore the partial derivative of the logarithmic negativity of two adjacent intervals with respect to the logarithm of the harmonic ratio of their lengths while their ratio and the other parameters are kept fixed. Considering the ground state of the harmonic chain on the line and in the massive regime, we report numerical results showing that this quantity displays a monotonically decreasing behaviour.

Abstract: First-passage times are often the most relevant aspect of a complex Markovian network, because they signify when information processing has resulted in a definite decision. Previous studies have shown that for kinetic proofreading networks in the limit of large network size the first-passage time distribution converges either to a delta or to an exponential distribution. Remarkably, these two forms correspond to the two extreme distributions of minimal and maximal entropy for a fixed mean, respectively. Here we build on the connection between first-passage times and graph theory to show that these two limits are not model-specific, but arise generically in Markovian networks from the distribution of the eigenvalues of the generator matrix. A deterministic peak emerges when infinitely many eigenvalues contribute, while the exponential limit arises from a single dominant eigenvalue. We also show that the exponential limit emerges robustly for reversible networks when a backward bias exists. In contrast, the deterministic limit is not obtained from a simple reversal of this condition, but under structurally tighter conditions, revealing a fundamental asymmetry between both regimes. Our theoretical analysis is illustrated and validated by computer simulations of one-step master equations and random networks.

Abstract: Transferring a physical system from an initial to a final state while minimizing energetic losses is an interdisciplinary control problem that bridges stochastic thermodynamics and optimal transport theory. Recent research typically considers problems in which the optimal solution is realized via conservative forces, but whether this situation applies depends on the problem's constraints. In systems with complex topologies like discrete networks, the optimal, dissipation-minimizing protocol involves applying nonconservative forces along cycles if the timescales of the transitions in the network are fixed. We show that although nonconservative driving is optimal in this setting, a conservative protocol exists whose dissipation is at most twice the optimal one. This finding is complemented with an example modeling transport across an energy barrier, which illustrates such improvements of order 1 explicitly. Qualitatively, conservative driving falls short of achieving optimality because direct transport across the barrier is avoided. We conclude with a discussion that the optimality of nonconservative driving might be a generic phenomenon: As fewer degrees of freedom can be optimized, additional degrees of freedom due to adding nonconservative forces become more significant.

Abstract: Density waves conventionally describe the periodic modulation of charge or spin, yet the spatial modulation of electronic topology has remained elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a Berry-curvature density wave in the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3NiN with compensated spins. Using high-precision Sagnac Kerr microscopy, we directly image micrometer-scale modulations of the Berry curvature. These topological ripples exhibit orientations unpinned to the crystal lattice, forming a nematic phase that spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry. We attribute this instability to field-induced spatial variations of the spin texture driven by competing magnetic interactions. This discovery unveils a new class of collective order in spin-compensated magnets arising from the geometric phase of the wavefunction itself and offering a tunable degree of freedom for topological spintronics based on antiferromagnets and altermagnets.

Abstract: We report local conductivity imaging of edge states in monolayer graphene by millikelvin microwave impedance microscopy (MIM). At the charge-neutrality point, as the magnetic field increases, the local conductivity at the edge drops to zero more slowly than in the bulk. This behavior is consistent with the calculated spatial profile of the charge gap in the canted antiferromagnetic phase. For comparison, we also perform microwave imaging of integer quantum Hall states away from neutrality, which host dissipationless chiral edge channels. The evolution of the edge signal as a function of the bulk gap is fundamentally different between the Landau level filling factor $ν= 0$ and $|ν| \ge 1$ integer quantum Hall states, which can be qualitatively explained by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. Our results provide a comprehensive microscopic picture of the edge and bulk states as the Fermi level moves across the unique Landau-level spectrum of graphene.

Abstract: In this work, we perform ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity measurements to track the evolution of charge density wave (CDW) correlations in Sn-doped Kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. By extracting the coherent phonon spectrum, we evidence robust signatures of CDW correlations at temperature and doping ranges far beyond the phase boundary of long-range CDW order. Remarkably, we unveil short-range CDW correlations survive up to room temperature in $x = 0.32$ Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, supported by synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements. We point out the introduction of quenched disorder by Sn doping can pin the CDW and form static short-range CDW, which can explain the observed persistent CDW signatures. Our results thus corroborate the ubiquity and robustness of CDW correlations in Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and provide new insights on the role of disorders on the CDW correlations in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family.

Abstract: Exact formulas for the optical conductivity and the Hall conductivity of the two dimensional Hubbard model are derived in terms of an effective theory description of the local moment fluctuation in the system. In this framework, the quantum Monte Carlo simulation of the electromagnetic response of such a strongly correlated electron system becomes sign-problem-free in many physically relevant cases. In particular, it is sign-problem-free when we assume the widely used Millis-Monien-Pines form for the phenomenological susceptibility in the effective action of the fluctuating local moment, even though these local moments are now subjected to Landau damping as a result of their coupling to the itinerant quasiparticle on the fermi surface. This is true more generally when a $\varphi^{4}$ term is included in the effective action and is thus not restricted to the Gaussian limit. Here we demonstrate the power of this framework by studying the effect of thermal fluctuation of the local moment on the optical conductivity $σ^{xx}(ω)$ and the Hall conductivity $σ^{xy}(ω)$ of the cuprate superconductors. Both $σ^{xx}(ω)$ and $σ^{xy}(ω)$ calculated are found to exhibit a two-component structure, with a Drude component at low energy and a mid-infrared component at higher energy. Depending on the relative importance of the hole pocket and the electron pocket on the reconstructed fermi surface and the coupling strength to the local moment, the Drude component in $\mathrm{Im}σ^{xy}(ω)$ can be either positive or negative.(full-length abstract can be found in the main text.)

Abstract: We review recent advances in machine learning (ML) force-field methods for Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) simulations of itinerant electron magnets, focusing on scalability and transferability. Built on the principle of locality, a deep neural network model is developed to efficiently and accurately predict the electron-mediated forces governing spin dynamics. Symmetry-aware descriptors constructed through a group-theoretical approach ensure rigorous incorporation of both lattice and spin-rotation symmetries. The framework is demonstrated using the prototypical s-d exchange model widely employed in spintronics. ML-enabled large-scale simulations reveal novel nonequilibrium phenomena, including anomalous coarsening of tetrahedral spin order on the triangular lattice and the freezing of phase separation dynamics in lightly hole-doped, strong-coupling square-lattice systems. These results establish ML force-field frameworks as scalable, accurate, and versatile tools for modeling nonequilibrium spin dynamics in itinerant magnets.

Abstract: The pressurized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu2(BO3)2 has been found to host a plaquette-singlet phase and an antiferromagnetic phase that break different symmetries spontaneously.The recent experiment showed that their transition is of a first order nature, which seems against the pursuit of exotic and deconfined degrees of freedom in this famous frustrated quantum magnet. We found a new direction in this study. By applying a magnetic field to the material, we discover that SrCu2(BO3)2 exhibits a universal and metallic T-linear specific heat behavior in a large magnetitic field range close to the pressure of zero-field first order transition between plaquette-singlet and antiferromagnetic phases. Such an unexpected gapless response from an electronically gapped Mott insulator could be attributed to magnetized Dirac spinons liberated by the combined effect of magnetic field and pressure, consistently seen from our quantum many-body thermal tensor network computation of the Shastry-Sutherland model under magnetic field. Such a robust and universal T-linear specific heat phase points out the richness of the phase diagram of the material expanded by the axes of pressure and magnetic field and is calling for new theoretical frameworks to its full explanation.
