### [1] [Marginal Fermi liquids from Fermi surfaces coupled via matrix boson gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02039)
*Vibhu Mishra*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Study of a critical metallic model in large-N limit reveals marginal Fermi liquid behavior and logarithmic specific heat corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the critical metallic point and understand the behavior of self-energies and specific heat in the large-N limit.

Method: A model involving fermions and bosons with slave-boson interactions was analyzed in the large-N limit, evaluating self-energies and specific heat corrections.

Result: The electronic self-energy exhibits marginal Fermi liquid behavior for d = z+1, with specific heat corrections showing unique logarithmic dependencies.

Conclusion: The study reveals a critical metallic behavior in the large-N limit with marginal Fermi liquid characteristics at specific dimensions.

Abstract: We propose a model of metallic critical point which we study at $T=0$ in the
large-$N$ limit. We start with two species of fermions $c_i, f_i$, each with
$N$ flavors and matrix bosons $b_{ij}$ with $N^2$ components. They interact
with each other via slave-boson like interaction $\int b_{ij}^{\dagger} \,
c_i^{\dagger}f_j$. The bosons have a bare dispersion of
$\varepsilon_{\textbf{q}}^b = \lambda_z |\textbf{q}|^z$ and we study the
problem in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show that for $d = z+1,$ the electronic
self energy shows marginal Fermi liquid behavior. We first evaluate the
fermionic self energy $\Sigma(i\omega)$ using the standard approximate boson
self energy $\Pi(\textbf{q}, i\nu) \propto |\nu|/|\textbf{q}|$ and find that
$\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(N/|\omega|)$ which shows a much weaker
dependence on $N$ when compared with similar results from non-SYK large-$N$
Ising-nematic models. Then we evaluate $\Sigma(i\omega)$ again using a more
precise form of $\Pi$ which allows us to study the interplay between $N
\rightarrow \infty$ limit for which $\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega
\ln(1/|\omega|)$, and the $\omega \rightarrow 0$ limit where we recover
$\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(N/|\omega|)$. We also use the full bosonic
self energy to obtain the correction to the bosonic specific heat as
$\frac{T}{N} \ln(1/T)$. Since there are $N^2$ bosons and $N$ fermions, the bulk
heat capacity for both fermions and bosons show nearly similar functional form
$NVT \ln(N/T)$ and $NVT \ln(1/T)$ respectively for $T \rightarrow 0$.

### [2] [Role of on-site Coulomb energy and negative-charge transfer in a Dirac semi-metal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02245)
*A. R. Shelke,C. -W. Chuang,S. Hamamoto,M. Oura,M. Yoshimura,N. Hiraoka,C. -N. Kuo,C. -S. Lue,A. Fujimori,A. Chainani*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: NiTe$_2$ is a moderately correlated $p$-type Dirac semimetal with $U_{dd} = 3.7$ eV and $Δ = -2.8$ eV, resolved through X-ray spectroscopy and cluster model calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve conflicting conclusions about the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$ and quantify its electronic parameters.

Method: The study employs soft and hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and Ni $2p-3d$ resonant photoemission spectroscopy (resonant-PES) to analyze the electronic structure of NiTe$_2$. Charge transfer cluster model calculations were used to quantify electronic parameters.

Result: The on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) in Ni $3d$ states is 3.7 eV, and the negative charge-transfer energy ($Δ$) is -2.8 eV. The d-p hybridization strength ($T_{eg}$) is lower in NiTe$_2$ compared to NiO, and the increased $d^n$ count on the Ni site is attributed to negative-$Δ$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Despite $U_{dd} > |Δ|$, NiTe$_2$ retains a moderately correlated $p$-type Dirac semimetal character.

Conclusion: NiTe$_2$ is identified as a moderately correlated $p$-type Dirac semimetal due to finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ despite its negative charge-transfer energy.

Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in combination with band structure
calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide
NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, there are conflicting
conclusions in the literature regarding the role of electron correlations in
NiTe$_2$. We study the core-level and valence band electronic structure of
single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
(SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ resonant
photoemission spectroscopy(resonant-PES) to quantify electronic parameters in
NiTe$_2$. The on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) in the Ni $3d$ states is
quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states
and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS
spectra are analyzed by charge transfer cluster model calculations using the
experimentally estimated $U_{dd}$ (= 3.7 eV), and the results show that
NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative charge-transfer energy ($\Delta$ = -2.8 eV). The
same type of cluster model analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known
strongly correlated charge-transfer insulator character, with $U_{dd}$ = 7.0 eV
and $\Delta$ = 6.0 eV. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for
NiTe$_2$$<$NiO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in
NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO is not due to an increase in $T_{eg}$.
The increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron
is attributed to negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$. However, since
$U_{dd}$$>$$|\Delta|$, the results indicate the important role of a finite
repulsive $U_{dd}$ in making NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated $p$-type Dirac
semi-metal.

### [3] [Benchmarking Non-perturbative Many-Body Approaches in the Exactly Solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02292)
*Hui Li,Ziyu Li,Chen-run Yu*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The HK model benchmarks many-body methods, revealing GW's unexpected accuracy for Mott physics and highlighting HGW and SGW strengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) in simulating strongly correlated electron systems, particularly due to the fermionic sign problem and uncertainties in numerical analytic continuation.

Method: The study uses the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model to evaluate three many-body approximations (GW, HGW, SGW) by comparing their Green's functions, spectral functions, and response functions with exact solutions.

Result: The GW approximation, often deemed inadequate for strong correlation, exhibits a new solution branch that accurately captures Mott physics. HGW performs well for charge response, while SGW is effective for spin correlations.

Conclusion: The HK model is a valuable benchmarking tool for many-body approximations, revealing previously unnoticed capabilities of the GW method and providing insights into other approximations like HGW and SGW.

Abstract: The accurate simulation of strongly correlated electron systems remains a
central challenge in condensed matter physics, motivating the development of
various non-perturbative many-body methods. Such methods are typically
benchmarked against the numerical exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)
in the Hubbard model; however, DQMC is limited by the fermionic sign problem
and the uncertainties of numerical analytic continuation. To address these
issues, we use the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model as a
benchmarking platform to evaluate three many-body approximations: $GW$, $HGW$,
and $SGW$. We compare the Green's functions, spectral functions, and response
functions obtained from these approximations with the exact solutions. Our
analysis shows that the $GW$ approximation, often considered insufficient for
describing strong correlation, exhibits a previously unreported solution branch
that accurately reproduces Mott physics in the HK model. In addition, using a
covariant formalism, we find that $HGW$ provides an accurate description of
charge response, while $SGW$ performs well for spin correlations. Overall, our
work demonstrates that the HK model can effectively benchmark many-body
approximations and helps refine the understanding of $GW$ methods in strongly
correlated regimes.

### [4] [The two-dimensional optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model: ground state and thermodynamic properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02707)
*Jadson L. Portela e Silva,Gabriel Rein,Sebastião dos A. Sousa-Júnior,Fakher F. Assaad,Natanael C. Costa*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explores the optical SSH model, revealing new phases and higher VBS transition temperatures using advanced simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the long-range ordered phases in the two-dimensional optical SSH model as a function of electron-phonon coupling and phonon frequency.

Method: Sign-problem-free auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field analysis were used.

Result: Revealed the emergence of staggered and armchair valence bond solid (VBS) phases, as well as the O(4) antiferromagnetic phase. Finite-temperature simulations showed VBS transitions at higher critical temperatures compared to models with local electron-phonon coupling.

Conclusion: The study establishes the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of the optical SSH model, highlighting its similarities and contrasts with other electron-phonon systems.

Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model,
in which the electron hopping amplitude is modulated by the difference between
neighboring phonon coordinates. Using sign-problem-free auxiliary-field quantum
Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by mean-field analysis, we determine the
long-range ordered phases as a function of the electron-phonon coupling and
phonon frequency. By examining both adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes, we
reveal the emergence of staggered and armchair valence bond solid (VBS) phases,
as well as the O(4) antiferromagnetic phase. In addition, finite-temperature
simulations show that the VBS transition occurs at critical temperatures
significantly higher than in models with local electron-phonon coupling,
consistent with the presence of lighter polarons in the metallic regime. These
findings establish the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of
the optical SSH model, which emphasize its similarities and contrasts with
other electron-phonon systems.

### [5] [EPR Revisited: Context-Indexed Elements of Reality and Operational Completeness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01930)
*Mikołaj Sienicki,Krzysztof Sienicki*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper reframes the EPR argument using context-indexed conditional states, showing that perfect predictions in no-signaling theories support context-dependent but not fixed-value inferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of the traditional EPR argument by introducing a context-dependent framework, avoiding the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables.

Method: The paper reframes the EPR argument by replacing fixed 'elements of reality' with context-indexed conditional states (measurement assemblages), and assumes operational completeness. It rigorously demonstrates the distinction through examples and theoretical analysis.

Result: The results show that perfect predictions in one-sided no-signaling theories support context-indexed inferences but do not justify fixed values across contexts. Examples and counterexamples (e.g., qubit singlet and PR box scenarios) are provided to ground the argument.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that in one-sided no-signaling theories, perfect predictions allow for context-indexed inferences but do not support assigning fixed values across all contexts. Examples like the qubit singlet scenario and continuous-variable cases illustrate this distinction.

Abstract: We reframe the EPR argument through an operational lens, replacing the notion
of fixed "elements of reality" with context-indexed conditional states - what's
often referred to as a measurement assemblage. This move deliberately sidesteps
the assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our
updated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures
observable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional
state that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context.
Crucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum
mechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now,
in any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided
no-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed
inferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed
values across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction. To
ground the argument, we offer examples: the qubit singlet scenario using Pauli
settings and CJWR thresholds, a continuous-variable case based on the Reid
criteria, and a counterexample in the spirit of the PR box, which highlights
the boundaries of what quantum theory can actually reach.

TL;DR: Quantum computers reliably simulate superconducting pairing in Fermi-Hubbard models, advancing quantum simulation of superconductivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting superconducting pairing correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model for simulating strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors.

Method: Measurement of pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum's Helios trapped-ion quantum computer.

Result: Significant pairing correlations were observed in non-equilibrium states, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe states with superconducting pairing correlations, paving the way for exploring superconductivity with quantum computers.

Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many
strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors,
whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation
and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing
correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their
off-diagonal character-which makes them inaccessible to local density
measurements-and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states.
Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three
different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum\'s Helios
trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing
induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model,
d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model
at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate
superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create
and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations,
opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.

### [7] [Generation and read-out of many-body Bell correlations with a probe qubit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01962)
*Marcin Płodzień,Jan Chwedeńczuk*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A simple method using a single qubit to create and certify entanglement and Bell correlations in many-body systems, enabling efficient quantum certification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for quantum technologies necessitates efficient methods to generate and classify non-classical correlations in complex many-body systems.

Method: A single qubit interacts with an N-qubit system to create and certify entanglement and many-body Bell correlations. Single-qubit measurements reveal multi-partite entanglement and N-body Bell correlations.

Result: The method successfully induces many-body quantum correlations and allows for their rapid and efficient certification through single-qubit measurements.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates that a single-qubit interaction is sufficient to induce and certify many-body quantum correlations, making it a simple and efficient tool for quantum technologies.

Abstract: As demand for quantum technologies increases, so does the need to generate
and classify non-classical correlations in complex many-body systems. We
introduce a simple and versatile method for creating and certifying
entanglement and many-body Bell correlations. This method relies on a single
qubit interacting with an $N$-qubit system. We demonstrate that: (i) such
pairwise interaction is sufficient to induce many-body quantum correlations,
and (ii) the qubit can serve as a probe to extract all information about these
correlations. Thus, single-qubit measurements reveal multi-partite entanglement
and $N$-body Bell correlations, enabling the rapid and efficient certification
of non-classicality in complex systems.

### [8] [Stability of mixed-state phases under weak decoherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01976)
*Yifan F. Zhang,Sarang Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Stability of Gibbs states under weak decoherence: local decoders can reverse effects, with implications for quantum memories and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the stability of Gibbs states under decoherence and explore implications for thermally stable quantum memories and diffusion models.

Method: The study focuses on analyzing the effect of weak local decoherence on systems with long-range correlations and critical slowing down, proving the existence of local decoders.

Result: The findings show that thermally stable quantum memories have a non-zero decoherence threshold near critical temperatures, and analogous stability exists in diffusion models with efficient local denoisers.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that locally reversing weak local decoherence is possible in Gibbs states of classical and commuting-Pauli Hamiltonians, maintaining stability in finite-temperature critical points and ordered phases.

Abstract: We prove that the Gibbs states of classical, and commuting-Pauli,
Hamiltonians are stable under weak local decoherence: i.e., we show that the
effect of the decoherence can be locally reversed. In particular, our
conclusions apply to finite-temperature equilibrium critical points and ordered
low-temperature phases. In these systems the unconditional spatio-temporal
correlations are long-range, and local (e.g., Metropolis) dynamics exhibits
critical slowing down. Nevertheless, our results imply the existence of local
"decoders" that undo the decoherence, when the decoherence strength is below a
critical value. An implication of these results is that thermally stable
quantum memories have a threshold against decoherence that remains nonzero as
one approaches the critical temperature. Analogously, in diffusion models,
stability of data distributions implies the existence of
computationally-efficent local denoisers in the late-time generation dynamics.

### [9] [Entropy-based random quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01988)
*Harry J. D. Miller*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new entropy-based random matrix ensemble for quantum states is developed, showing higher purity and boundary behavior, with applications in tomography and entanglement analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the statistical properties of quantum states using an information-geometric approach, offering an alternative to the Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures-Hall ensemble methods.

Method: The authors construct a random matrix ensemble for states using the information metric derived from von-Neumann entropy and relative entropy. They develop an algorithm to generate entropy-based random density matrices by sampling bipartite pure states.

Result: The ensemble exhibits higher purity and a tendency towards the boundary of full-rank states. It serves as a useful tool for Bayesian quantum state tomography in high purity regimes and for studying typical entanglement in finite depth quantum circuits.

Conclusion: The entropy-based ensemble provides a new method for generating random states with higher purity, distinguishing it from traditional approaches, and offers applications in Bayesian quantum state tomography and entanglement quantification.

Abstract: In quantum information geometry, the curvature of von-Neumann entropy and
relative entropy induce a natural metric on the space of mixed quantum states.
Here we use this information metric to construct a random matrix ensemble for
states and investigate its key statistical properties such the eigenvalue
density and probability distribution of entropy. We present an algorithm for
generating these entropy-based random density matrices by sampling a class of
bipartite pure states, thus providing a new recipe for random state generation
that differs from the well established Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures-Hall ensemble
approaches. We find that a distinguishing feature of the ensemble is its larger
purity and increased volume towards the boundary of full-rank states. The
entropy-based ensemble can thus be used as a uninformative prior for Bayesian
quantum state tomography in high purity regimes, and as a tool for quantifying
typical entanglement in finite depth quantum circuits.

### [10] [What is special about the Kirkwood-Dirac distributions?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01996)
*Matéo Spriet,Christopher Langrenez,Raymond Brummelhuis,Stephan De Bièvre*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Kirkwood-Dirac representations are uniquely characterized by their alignment of conditional expectations with optimal predictors in quantum mechanics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize what makes Kirkwood-Dirac representations special among quasiprobability representations in quantum mechanics.

Method: The study examines all quasiprobability representations defined on the joint spectrum of observables A and B that are compatible with the Born rule, focusing on their properties and implications.

Result: Only the Kirkwood-Dirac representation ensures that the conditional expectation of any observable X given B coincides with the optimal predictor of X by a function of B.

Conclusion: The Kirkwood-Dirac representation stands out among quasiprobability representations due to its unique property of aligning conditional expectations with optimal predictors.

Abstract: Among all possible quasiprobability representations of quantum mechanics, the
family of Kirkwood-Dirac representations has come to the foreground in recent
years because of the flexibility they offer in numerous applications. This
raises the question of their characterisation: what makes Kirkwood-Dirac
representations special among all possible choices? We show the following. For
two observables $\hat A$ and $\hat B$, consider all quasiprobability
representations of quantum mechanics defined on the joint spectrum of $\hat A$
and $\hat B$, and that have the correct marginal Born probabilities for $\hat
A$ and $\hat B$. For any such Born-compatible quasiprobability representation,
we show that there exists, for each observable $\hat{X}$, a naturally
associated conditional expectation, given $\hat B$. In addition, among the
aforementioned representations, only the Kirkwood-Dirac representation has the
following property: its associated conditional expectation of $\hat{X}$ given
$\hat{B}$ coincides with the best predictor of $\hat{X}$ by a function of $\hat
B$, for all $\hat X$.

### [11] [Spread and circuit complexity as a measure of particle content and phase space fluctuations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02013)
*Satyaki Chowdhury*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper connects quantum circuit/spread complexity to particle content and phase-space fluctuations using a time-dependent oscillator model, with implications for quantum field theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how quantum complexity measures correlate with physically meaningful quantities, such as particle production and phase-space fluctuations, particularly in the context of quantum field theory.

Method: A harmonic oscillator with time-dependent mass and frequency is used as a toy model to analyze the relation between circuit/spread complexity and physical quantities such as particle content and operator variances.

Result: Both circuit and spread complexity are determined by the mean number of quanta and its rate of change, with direct links to position and momentum operator variances. A universal relation between spread and circuit complexity is also established.

Conclusion: This paper establishes a clear link between quantum complexity measures (circuit and spread complexity) and physical quantities like particle content and phase-space fluctuations, offering new insights for quantum field theory in curved backgrounds.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relation between different notions of
quantum complexity, namely, circuit and spread complexity and physically
meaningful quantities such as the particle content of the quantum state and the
variances of position and momentum operators. Using a harmonic oscillator with
time-dependent mass and frequency as a toy model, we show that both circuit and
spread complexity at any instant is determined by the mean number of quanta and
its rate of change. Furthermore, both complexity and its growth are directly
linked to the variances of the position and momentum operators, providing a
clear physical interpretation of complexity in terms of the state's excitation
and phase-space fluctuation. Although the analysis is carried out for a single
time-dependent oscillator, the results have direct relevance for quantum field
theory in curved backgrounds, where individual field modes effectively behave
as time-dependent oscillators. This offers new insights into how quantum
complexity encodes particle production and phase space fluctuations in
non-holographic systems. Finally, we establish a precise and potentially
universal relation between spread and circuit complexity for the time evolved
state suggesting deeper connections between different complexity measures in
the context of field theories on curved backgrounds.

Motivation: To enhance the secure key rate in high-dimensional quantum key distribution by correcting spatial-mode distortion induced by atmospheric turbulence.

Method: Leveraging the phase conjugation property of stimulated parametric down-conversion for all-optical dynamic correction of spatial-mode distortion caused by atmospheric turbulence.

Result: Numerical simulations and experimental results show the scheme reduces quantum error rates below the security threshold even under strong turbulence.

Conclusion: The proposed turbulence-resilient scheme demonstrates the potential of nonlinear optical approaches for robust quantum communication in realistic free-space environments, with implications for practical long-distance secure quantum channels.

Abstract: In this work, we propose and demonstrate a turbulence-resilient scheme for
free-space quantum communication. By leveraging the phase conjugation property
of stimulated parametric down-conversion, our scheme enables all-optical
dynamic correction of spatial-mode distortion induced by atmospheric
turbulence, thereby enhancing the secure key rate in high-dimensional quantum
key distribution. We develop a theoretical model that provides detailed
guidelines for selecting the optimal basis and spatial properties needed to
maximize the efficiency of the proposed scheme. Both numerical simulations and
experimental results show that, even under strong turbulence, our scheme can
reduce the quantum error rates well below the security threshold. These results
highlight the potential of nonlinear optical approaches as powerful tools for
robust quantum communication in realistic free-space environments. Our work
could have important implications for the practical implementation of secure
quantum channels over long free-space distances.

### [13] [Geometric characterization of non-Gaussian entanglement for finite stellar rank states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02076)
*Carlos E. Lopetegui-Gonzalez,Massimo Frigerio,Mattia Walschaers*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A framework for analyzing non-Gaussian entanglement in bosonic states, using atomic decomposition of stellar polynomials to characterize entanglement structure and derive separability criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the entanglement structure of non-Gaussian bosonic states, particularly those of finite stellar rank.

Method: The method involves analyzing non-Gaussian entanglement through the atomic decomposition of stellar polynomials and their structural graphs, focusing on essential variables and symplectic rank.

Result: The results include full characterization of entanglement structure via atomic decomposition, complete separability criteria for two-mode states, and extensions to stellar-rank-2 states across multiple modes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by demonstrating how the introduced framework can isolate genuinely non-Gaussian resources and quantify preparation complexity in bosonic states.

Abstract: We introduce a general framework for the analysis of non-Gaussian
entanglement in bosonic states of finite stellar rank. The central result is
the full characterization of their entanglement structure through the atomic
decomposition of their stellar polynomial and its associated structural graph,
whose connected components determine the mode-intrinsic entanglement content of
the state and all partitions compatible with passive separability. An essential
ingredient in this construction is the concept of essential variables, which
identify the minimal number of effective modes involved in a core state, in
direct correspondence with the symplectic rank. This reduction provides the
foundation for decomposing stellar polynomials into atomic factors and for
revealing the underlying entanglement structure. Building on this, we derive
complete separability criteria for two-mode states, expressed through
hyperplane decompositions of zero sets, and for stellar-rank-2 states across
arbitrary number of modes. Applications to several example states illustrate
how the method isolates genuinely non-Gaussian resources and quantifies
preparation complexity.

TL;DR: A TFT architecture suppresses ZZ interactions in superconducting qubits, enabling high-fidelity gates even with large detunings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of residual ZZ interactions in superconducting quantum systems, which exacerbate frequency crowding and microwave crosstalk when qubit-qubit detunings are smaller than individual anharmonicities.

Method: The study introduced a TFT architecture where two transmon qubits are coupled via a fluxonium qubit. This coupling method effectively suppresses residual ZZ interactions. Experimental validation was performed by identifying zero-ZZ interaction points and implementing adiabatic, coupler-flux-biased controlled-Z gates.

Result: The TFT architecture eliminated residual ZZ interactions even for qubit-qubit detunings of 409 MHz and 616 MHz. High-fidelity controlled-Z gates were achieved, with fidelities of 99.64(6)% and 99.68(8)%.

Conclusion: The TFT (Transmon-Fluxonium-Transmon) architecture successfully eliminates residual ZZ interactions in two-qubit systems, even when qubit-qubit detunings exceed their anharmonicities. Experimental results demonstrated high-fidelity controlled-Z gates with fidelities of 99.64(6)% and 99.68(8)%.

Abstract: Eliminating residual ZZ interactions in a two-qubit system is essential for
reducing coherent errors during quantum operations. In a superconducting
circuit platform, coupling two transmon qubits via a transmon coupler has been
shown to effectively suppress residual ZZ interactions. However, in such
systems, perfect cancellation usually requires the qubit-qubit detuning to be
smaller than the individual qubit anharmonicities, which exacerbates frequency
crowding and microwave crosstalk. To address this limitation, we introduce TFT
(Transmon-Fluxonium-Transmon) architecture, wherein two transmon qubits are
coupled via a fluxonium qubit. The coupling mediated by the fluxonium
eliminates residual ZZ interactions even for transmons detuned larger than

TL;DR: Study of three two-qubit models reveals how quantum interactions and criticality affect quantum battery performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore energy storage and transfer processes governed by quantum mechanical laws in quantum batteries.

Method: Study of three models of two-qubit open quantum systems: (1) two central spins immersed in spin baths, (2) a two-qubit model interacting with a squeezed thermal bath, and (3) a two-qubit model where one qubit acts as a battery and the other as a charger interacting with an anisotropic spin-chain bath.

Result: Inter-qubit interactions, inter-atomic distance, bath temperature, and quantum criticality in the bath significantly impact the performance and storage capacity of quantum batteries.

Conclusion: Quantum criticality in the anisotropic spin-chain bath significantly enhances the storage capacity of the quantum battery.

Abstract: Quantum batteries have emerged as promising platforms for exploring energy
storage and transfer processes governed by quantum mechanical laws. In this
work, we study three models of two-qubit open quantum systems. The first model
comprises two central spins immersed in spin baths, and both central spins are
collectively considered as quantum batteries. The impact of inter-qubit
interactions on the performance of the quantum battery is investigated. In the
second model, a two-qubit model interacting with a squeezed thermal bath serves
as a collective quantum battery, where the impact of inter-atomic distance and
the bath temperature on the battery's performance is explored. Furthermore, a
two-qubit model is used, where one qubit is modeled as a battery and the other
as a charger. The charger in this model interacts with an anisotropic
spin-chain bath, which is conducive to quantum criticality. It is demonstrated
that this criticality has a substantial impact on the quantum battery's storage
capacity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenges in benchmarking quantum computers, including exponential scaling, insensitivity to important errors, and poorly-motivated performance metrics, along with the need for a tool to easily create new benchmarks.

Method: The paper introduces a software tool called 	exttt{scarab}, which employs efficient fidelity estimation techniques like mirror circuit fidelity estimation and subcircuit volumetric benchmarking to create scalable benchmarks from user-chosen quantum circuits and algorithms.

Result: The software tool 	exttt{scarab} enables the creation of efficient and robust benchmarks for quantum circuits, even those with thousands or millions of qubits, and demonstrates its utility through various applications.

Conclusion: The introduced software tool 	exttt{scarab} successfully addresses the challenges of creating scalable and reliable benchmarks for quantum computers, providing a user-friendly interface for generating efficient benchmarks even for large-scale circuits.

Abstract: Creating scalable, reliable, and well-motivated benchmarks for quantum
computers is challenging: straightforward approaches to benchmarking suffer
from exponential scaling, are insensitive to important errors, or use
poorly-motivated performance metrics. Furthermore, curated benchmarking suites
cannot include every interesting quantum circuit or algorithm, which
necessitates a tool that enables the easy creation of new benchmarks. In this
work, we introduce a software tool for creating scalable and reliable
benchmarks that measure a well-motivated performance metric (process fidelity)
from user-chosen quantum circuits and algorithms. Our software, called
$\texttt{scarab}$, enables the creation of efficient and robust benchmarks even
from circuits containing thousands or millions of qubits, by employing
efficient fidelity estimation techniques, including mirror circuit fidelity
estimation and subcircuit volumetric benchmarking. $\texttt{scarab}$ provides a
simple interface that enables the creation of reliable benchmarks by users who
are not experts in the theory of quantum computer benchmarking or noise. We
demonstrate the flexibility and power of $\texttt{scarab}$ by using it to turn
existing inefficient benchmarks into efficient benchmarks, to create benchmarks
that interrogate hardware and algorithmic trade-offs in Hamiltonian simulation,
to quantify the in-situ efficacy of approximate circuit compilation, and to
create benchmarks that use subcircuits to measure progress towards executing a
circuit of interest.

Motivation: To address unphysical evolution in molecular spin and solid-state systems treated with microscopic master equations, ensuring that fermionic statistics are preserved when single particle approximations are used.

Method: The study presents and applies mathematical constraints on system-environment parameters to ensure N-representability in microscopically-derived Markovian master equations, including the unified master equation, universal Lindblad equation, and Redfield master equation.

Result: Demonstrated constraints for various master equations to preserve N-representability and explored the use of Pauli factors for operators that break these constraints.

Conclusion: This work promotes feasible applications of novel microscopic master equations for realistic chemical systems by ensuring N-representable statistics through mathematical constraints and the addition of Pauli factors where necessary.

Abstract: Microscopic master equations have gained traction for the dissipative
treatment of molecular spin and solid-state systems for quantum technologies.
Single particle approximations are often invoked to treat these systems, which
can lead to unphysical evolution when combined with master equation approaches.
We present a mathematical constraint on the system-environment parameters to
ensure that microscopically-derived Markovian master equations preserve
fermionic, $N$-representable statistics when applied to reduced systems. We
demonstrate these constraints for the recently derived unified master equation
and universal Lindblad equation, along with the Redfield master equation for
cases when positivity issues are not present. For operators that break the
constraint, we explore the addition of Pauli factors to recover
$N$-representability. This work promotes feasible applications of novel
microscopic master equations for realistic chemical systems.

Conclusion: The proposed setup of two suspended carbon nanotubes with quantum dots demonstrates strong electron-phonon coupling and supports a maximally entangled Bell phase, making it a promising platform for simulating strongly correlated quantum systems.

Abstract: Suspended carbon nanotubes hosting electrostatically defined quantum dots
allow for exceptionally strong and tunable electromechanical coupling as well
as mechanical modes that can reach the quantum ground state of motion simply by

TL;DR: A novel strategy combining UD and MED for coherent state discrimination in quantum communication, enabling error-free results and adaptive protocols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of distinguishing phase-symmetric coherent states in quantum communication, particularly for CV-QKD protocols, by optimizing discrimination strategies.

Method: Combining UD and MED, with a focus on recycling 'failure' states from UD through sequential MED.

Result: The IR strategy achieves conclusive results with identifiable error-free outcomes, demonstrating success in low-amplitude regimes relevant to long-distance CV-QKD.

Conclusion: The proposed information recycling (IR) strategy combines unambiguous discrimination (UD) and minimum-error discrimination (MED) for coherent states, enabling conclusive results with some error-free outcomes, and introducing new possibilities for quantum communication.

Abstract: The discrimination of coherent states is a crucial component in quantum
communication with continuous variables, especially in quantum key distribution
protocols (CV-QKD), which rely on the ability to distinguish among different
coherent states to establish a shared secret key between two parties. Here, we
propose and analyze a strategy for distinguishing among N phase-symmetric
coherent states, which optimally takes unambiguous discrimination (UD) to the
deterministic regime, at the inevitable cost of having non-zero probability of
error. Despite the disturbance introduced by the separation map used in the UD
process, we show that for N > 2, the "failure" states of UD retain residual
information about the original input states, which can be further used for
discrimination. Rather than discarding inconclusive outcomes as in conventional
UD, we show that the "failure" states of UD can be optimally recycled by
performing a sequential minimum-error discrimination (MED). This strategy,
which we call information recycling (IR), combines the benefits of both MED and
optimal UD: It always provides conclusive results while allowing for a subset
of those results to be error-free, which are identifiable by an ancillary
system. We characterize the disturbance introduced by the state separation map
by the infidelity between input and failure states, demonstrating that it lower
bounds the error probability in the recycling stage. Furthermore, in the
low-amplitude regime-relevant for long-distance CV-QKD applications-we show
that the state separation achieves significant success while introducing
relatively low disturbance to the input states after failed events. Our results
open up new possibilities for adaptive and sequential discrimination protocols
in continuous-variable settings, and could potentially be used in the design of
next-generation receivers in quantum communication.

Motivation: The integration of single-transmon couplers (STCs) increases control line requirements, creating a bottleneck for chip routing and scalability in superconducting qubit systems.

Method: The paper proposes a double-transmon coupler (DTC) architecture with shared control lines to reduce wiring complexity and suppress static ZZ coupling. It experimentally validates the approach through two gate implementations: a fast coupler Z-control-based CZ gate and a parametric iSWAP gate.

Result: The multiplexed DTC architecture successfully reduces wiring complexity and suppresses static ZZ coupling while achieving high-fidelity gate operations (99% for Bell states and 96% for GHZ states).

Conclusion: The multiplexed DTC architecture shows significant potential for reducing wiring complexity in superconducting quantum processors, enhancing scalability while maintaining high-fidelity gate operations (99% for Bell states and 96% for GHZ states).

Abstract: Precise control of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing both
quantum simulation and quantum error correction. Recently, transmon qubit
systems employing the single-transmon coupler (STC) scheme have demonstrated
high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gate operations by dynamically tuning the
effective coupling between qubits. However, the integration of STCs increases
the number of control lines, thereby posing a significant bottleneck for chip
routing and scalability. To address this challenge, we propose a robust control
line multiplexing scheme based on a double-transmon coupler (DTC) architecture,
which enables shared coupler control lines to substantially reduce wiring
complexity. Moreover, we experimentally verify that this multiplexed
configuration efficiently suppresses undesirable static $ZZ$ coupling while
maintaining accurate control over two-qubit gate operations. We further
demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture through two distinct gate
implementations: a fast coupler $Z$-control-based CZ gate and a parametric
iSWAP gate. To validate the practical applicability of this multiplexing
approach in quantum circuits, we prepare Bell and three-qubit GHZ states using
the proposed scheme with fidelity exceeding 99% and 96%, respectively. This
multiplexed DTC architecture offers significant potential to minimize wiring
overhead in two-dimensional qubit arrays, thereby greatly enhancing the
scalability of superconducting quantum processors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the propagation dynamics of spatial quantum correlations in bright structured twin beams for applications in quantum imaging, cryptography, and information processing.

Method: Theoretical derivation of an analytical expression for spatial quantum correlation evolution, complemented by experimental measurements of intensity-difference noise in twin beams.

Result: Localized correlations in the near field and anti-correlations in the far field with a Gaussian pump; transition to delocalized correlations with a Laguerre-Gaussian pump.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the behavior of spatial quantum correlations and suggests applications in quantum information, imaging, and sensing.

Abstract: Quantum correlations in the spatial domain hold great promise for
applications in quantum imaging, quantum cryptography and quantum information
processing, owing to the infinite dimensionality of the associated Hilbert
space. Here, we present a theoretical investigation, complemented by
experimental measurements, of the propagation dynamics of the spatial quantum
correlations in bright structured twin beams generated via a four-wave mixing
process in a double-$\Lambda$ configuration in atomic vapor. We derive an
analytical expression describing the evolution of the spatial quantum
correlation distribution from the near field to the far field. To qualitatively
support the theoretical predictions, we perform experiments measuring
intensity-difference noise between different spatial subregions of the twin
beams as they propagate from the near field to the far field. The presence of
quantum correlations is manifested as squeezing in the intensity difference
noise measurement. With a Gaussian pump, we observe localized correlations in
the near field and localized anti-correlations in the far field. In contrast,
with a structured Laguerre-Gaussian pump, there is a transition from localized
correlations in the near field to delocalized correlations in the far field.
The present results offer valuable insights into the fundamental behavior of
spatial quantum correlations and open possibilities for potential applications
in quantum information, quantum imaging and sensing.

Motivation: 以往数值分析表明AB算子的本征函数可能代表具有确定到达时间的量子态，但缺乏严格数学证明，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过分析AB算子具有复数本征值的本征函数，研究其时间演化行为，并证明时间演化后的到达时间位置概率密度分布在实部时间点形成Dirac delta序列。

Result: 证明了AB算子的本征函数确实是具有确定到达时间的量子态，且时间演化的概率密度分布在实部时间点收敛为Dirac delta序列。

Conclusion: 本文证明了阿哈罗诺夫-博姆（AB）算子的本征函数确实代表了在到达点具有确定到达时间的量子态。通过考虑具有复数本征值的本征函数，验证了这些函数可以被视为合法的到达时间本征函数，因为它们在时间演化后会坍缩到到达点。

Abstract: Previous numerical analyses on the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) operator representing
the quantum time-of-arrival (TOA) observable for the free particle have
indicated that its eigenfunctions represent quantum states with definite
arrival time at the arrival point. In this paper, we give the mathematical
proof that this is indeed the case. An essential element of this proof is the
consideration of the eigenfunctions of the AB operator with complex
eigenvalues. These eigenfunctions can be considered legitimate TOA
eigenfunctions because they evolve unitarily to collapse at the arrival point
at the time equal to the real part of their eigenvalue. We show that the
time-evolved TOA position probability density distribution evaluated at the
time equal to the real part of the eigenvalue forms a dirac delta sequence in
the limit as the imaginary part of the eigenvalue approaches zero.

Conclusion: The use of pulsed laser excitation and time gating techniques significantly improves NV spin resonance visibility, increasing SNR by up to 4x and reducing measurement time by 16x, enhancing NV-based quantum sensing in high background environments.

Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond are among the leading solid state quantum

applications such as magnetic field sensing, thermometry, and bioimaging.
However, in high background environments,such as those encountered in in vitro

In this work, we analytically and experimentally investigate the use of pulsed
laser excitation combined with time gating techniques to suppress background
fluorescence and enhance the signal to noise ratio in NV based quantum sensing,
with an emphasis on spin enhanced biosensing. Through experimental studies
using mixed ensembles of silicon vacancy and NV centers in bulk diamond, as
well as fluorescent nanodiamonds on NC substrates, we demonstrate significant
improvements in NV spin resonance visibility, demonstrated by an increase of
the SNR by up to 4x, and a resulting measurement time reduction by 16x. The

Motivation: To address the dynamics of multichannel Dicke superradiance beyond stationary properties, focusing on tunable competing decay channels.

Method: A symbolic quantum-trajectory method is applied to solve the multichannel Dicke superradiant model, extending previous hydrodynamic mean-field approximations.

Result: For two channels, the ground-state distribution shows a first-order phase transition at equal channel-rate ratios. For d channels, scaling laws for superradiant peak time and intensity are derived.

Conclusion: The study extends single-channel Dicke dynamics to multilevel emitters, providing a practical tool for experiments involving multiple collective decay paths in cavity and waveguide setups.

Abstract: We develop and solve a Dicke superradiant model with two or more competing
collective decay channels of tunable rates. Recent work analyzed stationary
properties of multichannel Dicke superradiance using hydrodynamic mean-field
approximations as shown by Mok et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L022015 (2025)]. We
extend this with a symbolic quantum-trajectory method, providing a simple route
to analytic solutions. For two channels, the behavior of the stationary
ground-state distribution resembles a first-order phase transition at the point
where the channel-rate ratio is equal to unity. For $d$ competing channels, we
obtain scaling laws for the superradiant peak time and intensity. These results
unify and extend single-channel Dicke dynamics to multilevel emitters and
provide a compact tool for cavity and waveguide experiments, where
permutation-symmetric reservoirs engineer multiple collective decay paths.

Conclusion: 该研究首次将安全概念与操作样本预算法则嵌入PAC学习中，并将安全性锚定在量子信息中，为学习安全性提供了标准化保证。

Abstract: Security in machine learning is fragile when data are exfiltrated or
perturbed, yet existing frameworks rarely connect the definition and analysis
of the security to learnability. In this work, we develop a theory of secure
learning grounded in the probably-approximately-correct (PAC) viewpoint and
develop an operational framework that links data-path behavior to finite-sample
budgets. In our formulation, an accuracy-confidence target is evaluated via a
run-based sequential test that halts after a prescribed number of consecutive
validations, and a closed-form budget bound guarantees the learning success if
the data-path channel is admissible; the acceptance must also exceed a
primitive random-search baseline. We elevate and complete our secure-learning
construction in the context of quantum information -- establishing
quantum-secure PAC learning: for prepare-and-measure scenarios, the data-path
admissibility is set to be threshold fixed by Holevo information, not a
learner-tunable tolerance. Thus, a certified information advantage for the
learner directly becomes the learning security -- an effect with no classical
analogue. The channel-determined confidence follows naturally and basis sifting
is incorporated for practical deployments. This is the first complete framework
that simultaneously embeds a security notion and an operational sample-budget
law within the PAC learning and anchors the security in quantum information.
The resulting blueprint points toward standardized guarantees for the learning
security, with clear avenues for PAC-Bayes extensions and for integration with
advanced quantum machine learning front ends.

compressed by quantum hidden subgroup algorithms. We implement a variational
quantum autoencoder that autonomously learns both the symmetry type (e.g.,
$\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ vs. $\mathbb{Z}_4$) and the generalized
period from structured data. The system uses single photons encoded in path,
polarization, and time-bin degrees of freedom, with electronically controlled
waveplates enabling tunable quantum gates. Training via gradient descent
successfully identifies the hidden symmetry structure, achieving compression by
eliminating redundant database entries. We demonstrate two circuit ansatzes: a
parametrized generalized Fourier transform and a less-restricted architecture
for Simon's symmetry. Both converge successfully, with the cost function
approaching zero as training proceeds. These results provide experimental
proof-of-principle that photonic quantum computers can compress classical
databases by learning symmetries inaccessible to known efficient classical
methods, opening pathways for quantum-enhanced information processing.

TL;DR: Local classical shadows with correlated measurements improve quantum observable estimation, requiring fewer measurements for the same accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of accurately estimating observables in quantum systems is constrained by limited measurement shots. The study aims to improve estimation accuracy with fewer measurements.

Method: A variation of the classical shadows protocol was used, keeping measurements local while allowing shadows to be correlated. The method constructs locally optimal shadows to achieve unbiased estimators.

Result: The approach was validated through numerical experiments on molecular Hamiltonians (up to 40 qubits) and a 50-qubit Ising model, showing significant reductions in estimation errors.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that locally optimal shadows significantly reduce estimation errors compared to state-of-the-art methods, requiring fewer measurements for the same accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of observables in quantum systems is a central challenge
in quantum information science, yet practical implementations are fundamentally
constrained by the limited number of measurement shots. In this work we explore
a variation of the classical shadows protocol in which the measurements are
kept local while allowing the resulting classical shadows themselves to be
correlated. By constructing locally optimal shadows, we obtain unbiased
estimators that outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving the same
accuracy with substantially fewer measurements. We validate our approach
through numerical experiments on molecular Hamiltonians with up to 40 qubits
and a 50-qubit Ising model consistently observing significant reductions in
estimation errors.

Method: 移除了标准假设，采用Moore-Penrose逆来替代部分生成元，并基于Israel和Charnes的结果重新推导了微扰展开。对Jaynes-Cummings和Ising模型分别测试了第六和第五阶修正方程。

Result: 修正后的方程在两种模型中均未能准确捕捉精确解的动力学行为，修正项随着浴的维度指数增长导致微扰展开的收敛性丧失。

Conclusion: 修改后的TCL-ME在Jaynes-Cummings和Ising模型中未能准确捕捉精确解的动力学行为，原因是其修正项随着浴的维度呈指数增长，导致微扰展开的收敛性丧失。

Abstract: We attempt to modify the time-convolutionless master equation (TCL-ME) to be
more resistant to breakdown. We remove the standard assumption that a portion
of the generator is invertible by instead taking the Moore-Penrose inverse. We
rederive the perturbative expansion using Israel and Charnes' result, and test
the equation up to sixth and fifth orders on the Jaynes-Cummings and Ising
models, respectively. We find that in both cases, the modified equation fails
to capture the dynamics of the exact solution compared to the standard TCL due
to the terms of the modified equation scaling exponentially with the dimension
of the bath, and connect this failure to a loss of convergence of the
perturbative expansion.

Abstract: Cavity optomagnonic platforms offer a promising route for exploring quantum

modern quantum technologies. Here, we propose a theoretical scheme for
achieving nonreciprocal quantum correlations such as entanglement, quantum
discord, and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) via Barnett effect in a
molecular-optomagnonical system, where a yttrium iron garnet sphere is placed
in a microwave cavity that is hosting molecules. We show optimal parameter
regimes for achieving nonreciprocal quantum correlations through Barnett
effect. The generated entanglements are robust against thermal fluctuations,
persisting even at temperatures as high as $6000 K$. Our scheme suggests a new
tool for engineering noise-tolerant quantum correlations, and paves a way
toward realizing novel nonreciprocal quantum devices by integrating magnons
with molecular ensembles.

Abstract: Entanglement-based quantum links are the backbone of future quantum internet

further extended secure key distribution up to a 100km operational link
connecting the University of Nice to a ground-based optical station, a setup
compatible with future quantum satellite connections. Finally, by employing
wavelength demultiplexing to separate photons of entangled pairs, we performed
QKD across multiple ITU channels, achieving secure key exchange via the BBM92

Motivation: The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, device noise, and hybrid execution pipelines introduce risks that hinder reliable deployment of QML in safety-critical applications.

Method: Three foundational pillars are integrated: uncertainty quantification, adversarial robustness, and privacy preservation, formalized using quantum-specific trust metrics.

Result: Feasibility on NISQ devices is demonstrated, revealing correlations between uncertainty and risk, asymmetry in attack vulnerability, and privacy-utility trade-offs.

Conclusion: The research provides a roadmap for Trustworthy Quantum Machine Learning (TQML), emphasizing trustworthiness as a crucial design objective for quantum AI, validated through practical experiments on NISQ devices.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising paradigm for tackling
computational problems that challenge classical AI. Yet, the inherent
probabilistic behavior of quantum mechanics, device noise in NISQ hardware, and
hybrid quantum-classical execution pipelines introduce new risks that prevent
reliable deployment of QML in real-world, safety-critical settings. This
research offers a broad roadmap for Trustworthy Quantum Machine Learning
(TQML), integrating three foundational pillars of reliability: (i) uncertainty
quantification for calibrated and risk-aware decision making, (ii) adversarial
robustness against classical and quantum-native threat models, and (iii)
privacy preservation in distributed and delegated quantum learning scenarios.
We formalize quantum-specific trust metrics grounded in quantum information
theory, including a variance-based decomposition of predictive uncertainty,
trace-distance-bounded robustness, and differential privacy for hybrid learning
channels. To demonstrate feasibility on current NISQ devices, we validate a
unified trust assessment pipeline on parameterized quantum classifiers,
uncovering correlations between uncertainty and prediction risk, an asymmetry
in attack vulnerability between classical and quantum state perturbations, and
privacy-utility trade-offs driven by shot noise and quantum channel noise. This
roadmap seeks to define trustworthiness as a first-class design objective for
quantum AI.

TL;DR: AQIA introduces adaptive quantum Ising agents using feedback-reconfigurable interactions, revealing distinct self-organization regimes in programmable quantum matter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend programmable quantum matter into an adaptive domain by enabling dynamic interactions through feedback-reconfigurable media.

Method: The framework employs a Hamiltonian-based approach with finite transverse-field Ising subsystems interacting via state-dependent feedback channels, resolved self-consistently using a mean-field approximation.

Result: Numerical studies reveal three regimes: domain formation near critical points, glass-like frustration, and modular polarization, all independent of geometric embedding.

Conclusion: The AQIA framework demonstrates that informational similarity can drive coherent organization in adaptive quantum matter, offering a versatile model for studying self-organization and learning across different quantum platforms.

Abstract: The study introduces the Adaptive Quantum Ising Agents (AQIA) framework, a
Hamiltonian-based methodology that extends programmable quantum matter into an
adaptive domain. Each agent operates as a finite transverse-field Ising
subsystem, maintaining internal quantum coherence while interacting through
state-dependent feedback channels characterised by reduced observables such as
spin polarisation, bond correlation, and internal energy. These informational
couplings enable the transformation of a static lattice into a
feedback-reconfigurable medium. The effective Hamiltonian generated, which
remains Hermitian at each iteration, is resolved self-consistently using a
mean-field approximation, where the feedback fields are iteratively adjusted to
minimise the total energy. Numerical investigations identify three distinct
regimes: domain formation near the feedback--fluctuation critical point,
glass-like frustration due to competing feedback channels, and modular
polarisation sustained by structured interactions. These phenomena occur
independently of geometric embedding, illustrating that informational
similarity alone can induce coherent organisation. The AQIA framework is
adaptable to implementation on superconducting, trapped-ion, or Rydberg
platforms, offering a minimalistic model for exploring self-organisation and
learning in adaptive programmable quantum matter.

Abstract: The travelling salesman problem is a well-known example of
computationally-hard combinatorial problem for classical machines. Here, we
propose a novel variational quantum algorithm to solve it. The method is based
on the preparation of two maximally entangled quantum registers whose
correlations are assigned to different paths between pairs of cities. For $N$
cities, this encoding requires $2 \lceil\log_2 N\rceil$ qubits and the solution
to the problem is directly found in the correlation matrix of the two registers
composing the overall trial state. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we
implement this algorithm for generic problems with four cities on a
reconfigurable room-temperature silicon photonic circuit with integrated
photon-pair sources, used to initialize maximally entangled path-encoded
single-photon states.

Result: The review summarizes key theoretical techniques and experimental progress in single-photon switching, demonstrating compatibility with diverse quantum emitter platforms.

Conclusion: The review highlights the potential of quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic structures for realizing efficient, scalable, and high-fidelity single-photon switches, integrating theoretical and experimental advancements across multiple platforms.

Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic structures are an excellent platform
for controllable single-photon scattering. The tunable light-matter interaction
enables the construction of a single-photon switch -- a device that can route a
single photon from an input port to a selected output port. Such single-photon
switching devices can be integrated into reconfigurable photonic circuits to
actively control the photon propagation direction in a quantum network.
Ideally, a single-photon switch should be fast, efficient, scalable, compatible
with existing technology, and should preserve the routed photon states with
high fidelity. In this review, we focus on theoretical proposals and
experimental demonstrations of single-photon switches based on quantum emitters
coupled to solid-state nanostructures, including waveguide and cavity
architectures. We also present the theoretical methods that are commonly used
to model single-photon scattering in waveguide-based systems by applying them
to the elementary system of a two-level emitter coupled to a waveguide. This
review brings together key theoretical techniques from quantum optics, their
applications to controllable single-photon transport, and the experimental
realization of single-photon switching devices across different physical
platforms, including semiconductor quantum dots, neutral atoms, superconducting
qubits, and color centers.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of solving NP-complete optimization problems like the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP) on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices by optimizing quantum resources and reducing circuit complexity.

Method: The paper proposes VQGAP, a hybrid quantum-classical approach based on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), specifically Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). It decouples qubits from binary variables by using encoding/decoding functions to transform solutions within the problem constraints.

Result: Preliminary results from noiseless and noisy simulations show that VQGAP performs similarly to VQE while reducing the number of qubits and circuit depth.

Conclusion: VQGAP demonstrates promising performance in solving the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP) by optimizing quantum resources and reducing circuit complexity, achieving results comparable to VQE while requiring fewer qubits and shallower circuits.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms offer a compelling new avenue for addressing difficult
NP-complete optimization problems, such as the Generalized Assignment Problem
(GAP). Given the operational constraints of contemporary Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, hybrid quantum-classical approaches,
specifically Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) like the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE), promises to be effective approaches to solve real-world
optimization problems. This paper proposes an approach, named VQGAP, designed
to efficiently solve the GAP by optimizing quantum resources and reducing the
required parametrized quantum circuit width with respect to standard VQE. The
main idea driving our proposal is to decouple the qubits of ansatz circuits
from the binary variables of the General Assignment Problem, by providing
encoding/decoding functions transforming the solutions generated by ansatze in
the limited quantum space in feasible solutions in the problem variables space,
by exploiting the constraints of the problem. Preliminary results, obtained
through both noiseless and noisy simulations, indicate that VQGAP exhibits
performance and behavior very similar to VQE, while effectively reducing the
number of qubits and circuit depth.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how standard quantum theory emerges from higher-order quantum theory (quantum boxes) and explores the implications of this process.

Method: The authors analyze a hyper-decoherence process that satisfies certain axioms and evades a no-go theorem by relaxing constraints on signalling and uniqueness of purifications.

Result: The hyper-decoherence map successfully produces standard quantum theory from the theory of quantum boxes while bypassing the limitations of a no-go theorem.

Conclusion: The paper presents two opposing interpretations of the hyper-decoherence map: it could either indicate a genuine process producing causal quantum theory from a higher-order theory, or suggest a need to reconsider the axioms of hyper-decoherence, particularly the role of purity.

Abstract: We find a process satisfying the axioms of hyper-decoherence which produces
standard quantum theory from the theory of quantum boxes (higher-order quantum
theory with the non-signalling tensor product). This hyper-decoherence map
evades the no-go theorem of Lee and Selby by relaxing constraints on signalling
to the past and the uniqueness of purifications. We discuss some natural
opposing conclusions: that the existence of this map might be evidence of a
genuine hyper-decoherence process producing causal quantum theory from its
causally-indefinite higher-order theory; or that it serves as an indication
that the axioms of hyper-decoherence might need careful re-consideration,
especially regarding the subtle albeit central role that purity plays.

Result: Derived analytical expressions for probe and generated beams, identifying optimal Er concentration (3%) for maximizing vortex-transfer efficiency, and demonstrating tunable transitions between fast and slow regimes.

Conclusion: This study establishes Er YAG as a promising solid-state platform for coherent manipulation of structured light, with potential applications in high-dimensional quantum communication and slow-light photonic signal processing.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate coherent orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) transfer
and dispersion-controlled light propagation in a ladder-type Er YAG three-level
system. Using the density-matrix formalism and coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations,
we derive analytical expressions for the probe and generated beams that
explicitly incorporate Er ion concentration. We show that an incident
vortex-carrying probe beam transfers its OAM to a generated signal beam through
a concentration-dependent sum-frequency nonlinear process, with complete phase
and topological-charge preservation. By analyzing conversion efficiency,
spatial phase, and intensity distributions, we identify an optimal Er
concentration (3 percent) that maximizes vortex-transfer efficiency.
Furthermore, the absorption and dispersion spectra of the probe and generated
beams reveal the mechanism underpinning the vortex transfer and demonstrate
tunable transitions between fast and slow regimes. These results establish Er
YAG as a viable solid-state platform for the coherent manipulation of
structured light, enabling efficient vortex-beam frequency conversion and
dispersion engineering for applications in high-dimensional quantum

Motivation: To understand the relationship between operator growth in Hilbert space and the characteristics of the system eigenbasis, particularly focusing on the decay of matrix elements.

Method: Analyzing the growth of Krylov complexity in simple models by examining the off-diagonal decay of operator matrix elements in the system eigenbasis.

Result: Exponential or slower off-diagonal decay leads to exponential Krylov complexity growth, while algebraic or slower decay results in maximal growth. Non-chaotic systems can show exponential or maximal growth, and chaotic systems can exhibit sub-exponential growth.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the growth of Krylov complexity can be predicted from the off-diagonal decay of operator matrix elements in the system eigenbasis. It highlights that non-chaotic systems can exhibit exponential or maximal operator growth, while chaotic systems can show sub-exponential behavior.

Abstract: By analysing the growth of Krylov complexity for some simple models, we find
that the exponential growth of an operator in Hilbert space can be predicted
from the off-diagonal decay of the operator matrix elements in the system
eigenbasis. When the decay is exponential or slower, the Krylov complexity
grows exponentially; when it is algebraic or slower, the growth rate is
maximal. As a result, non-chaotic systems can generate exponential or even
maximal operator growth, and chaotic systems can show sub-exponential growth;
we give examples of both.

Result: Identified dynamical phase transitions between coexisting stationary states and mapped a phase diagram capturing asymmetric behavior for blue versus red detuning.

Conclusion: The results provide a framework for controlling driven nonlinear systems, enabling state manipulation and sensing in various platforms.

Abstract: The response of nonlinear resonators to multifrequency driving reveals rich
dynamics beyond conventional single-tone theory. We study a Duffing resonator
under bichromatic excitation and identify a competition between the two drives,
governed by their detuning and relative amplitudes. In the slow-beating regime,
where the tones are closely spaced, the secondary drive acts as a modulation
that induces dynamical phase transitions between coexisting stationary states.
We introduce the cycle-averaged amplitude as an order parameter and map the
resulting phase diagram as a function of the drive detuning and amplitude
ratio, capturing the pronounced asymmetry observed for blue versus red detuning
in experiment. We devise a model to link the onset of these transitions to the
resonance properties around the nonlinear stationary mode of the system. Our
results provide a framework for controlling driven nonlinear systems, enabling
state manipulation, and sensing in nanomechanical, optical, and superconducting

Abstract: The clock speed of topological quantum computers based on Majorana zero mode

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of electric and heat current fluctuations and their cross-correlations in a two-channel charge Kondo circuit under different driving forces, and to explore the role of particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries in thermoelectric transport.

Method: Investigating fluctuations of electric and heat currents, along with their cross-correlations, in a two-channel charge Kondo circuit under a voltage bias or temperature gradient.

Result: The ratios of noise to the applied voltage or temperature difference exhibit oscillations with gate voltage, resembling thermoelectric coefficients, while the mixed noise shows opposite behavior. The logarithmic temperature dependence signals non-Fermi-liquid behavior.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the fundamental relations between voltage- and temperature-induced noises in thermoelectric transport persist beyond the Fermi-liquid paradigm, as evidenced by the logarithmic temperature dependence and gate voltage oscillations of the noises.

Abstract: We investigate fluctuations of electric and heat currents, along with their
cross-correlations, in a two-channel charge Kondo circuit driven by either a
voltage bias or a temperature gradient applied across the weak link. The ratios
of voltage-driven electric/heat noise to the applied voltage $V$ exhibit
oscillations with the gate voltage $N$, resembling the behavior of the
thermoelectric coefficient $G_T$. In contrast, the ratios of temperature-driven
electric/heat noise to the temperature difference $\Delta T$ vary with $N$ in a
manner analogous to the thermal coefficient $G_H$ or the electric conductance
$G$. The mixed noise, which is defined as the correlation function between
electric and heat currents, displays behavior opposite to that of the above
noises. The logarithmic temperature dependence of these noises signals

the roles of particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries in thermoelectric

TL;DR: Chiral magnetic skyrmion flows in nanotracks enable nanofluidic logic computing by simplifying operations through flow manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the use of chiral magnetic skyrmions in nanofluidic logic computing, addressing the challenge of complexity in single-skyrmion manipulation.

Method: The researchers utilized parallel pipelines connected by an H-shaped junction to manipulate skyrmion flows via spin polarization angle adjustments.

Result: Fully developed skyrmion flows within a specific spin polarization angle range enable fluidic logical operations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that chiral magnetic skyrmion flows can be used for nanofluidic logic computing, reducing complexity by eliminating the need for single-skyrmion manipulation.

Abstract: Particle-like chiral magnetic skyrmions can flow in nanotracks and behave
like chiral fluids. Using interacting flows to perform logical operations is an
important topic in microfluidics and nanofluidics. Here, we report a basic
nanofluidic logic computing system based on chiral magnetic skyrmions flowing
in parallel pipelines connected by an H-shaped junction. The flow behaviors
could be manipulated by adjusting the spin polarization angle, which controls
the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. We demonstrate that within certain range of
the spin polarization angle, fully developed skyrmion flows could lead to
fluidic logical operations, which significantly reduce the complexity of
skyrmion logic as there is no need for deterministic creation, precise control,
and detection of a single isolated skyrmion. Our results suggest that the
chiral flow behaviors of magnetic quasiparticles may offer possibilities for
spintronic and nanofluidic functions.

*Seokju Lee,Seung Hun Lee,Bohm-Jung Yang*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A universal length scale ξₗ for flat bands is introduced, derived from intrinsic localization, and validated as the superconducting coherence length in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a universal length scale in flat band systems due to the embedding dependence of conventional geometric length scales.

Method: Analytical derivation of ξₗ as the localization length of an in-gap state proximate to the flat band, supported by numerical simulations on various lattice models.

Result: ξₗ is shown to be the superconducting coherence length in weak-coupling limit, confirming its role as a universal length scale for flat bands.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a universal length scale ξₗ for flat bands, derived from the intrinsic localization of compact localized states, and demonstrates its significance in many-body phenomena, particularly in flat-band superconductors.

Abstract: In flat band systems with quenched kinetic energy, most of the conventional
length scales related to the band dispersion become ineffectual. Although a few
geometric length scales, such as the quantum-metric length, can still be
defined, because of their embedding dependence, i.e., the dependence on the
choice of orbital positions used to construct the tight-binding model, they
cannot serve as a universal length scale of the flat band systems. Here, we
introduce an embedding-independent length scale $\xi_\text{flat}$ of a flat
band that is defined as the localization length of an in-gap state proximate to
the flat band. Because $\xi_\text{flat}$ is derived from the intrinsic
localization of compact localized states, it is solely determined by the
Hamiltonian and provides a robust foundation for embedding-independent
observables. We show analytically that the superconducting coherence length in
a flat-band superconductor is given by $\xi_\text{flat}$ in the weak-coupling
limit, thereby identifying $\xi_\text{flat}$ as the relevant length scale for
many-body phenomena. Numerical simulations on various lattice models confirm
all theoretical predictions, including the correspondence between
$\xi_\text{flat}$ and the superconducting coherence length. Our results
highlight $\xi_\text{flat}$ as a universal length scale for flat bands and open
a pathway to embedding-independent characterization of strongly interacting
flat-band materials.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the interaction between orbital currents and lattice dynamics, a largely unexplored area, and demonstrate the potential of phonon-driven orbital transport.

Method: Systematic investigation of the acoustic orbital Hall effect in light metals (Ti, Cr), including analysis of acoustic orbital currents, phonon-orbital coupling, and rectified acoustic voltages in nonmagnetic/ferromagnetic bilayers.

Result: Acoustic orbital currents in Ti show higher efficiency and longer diffusion length than acoustic spin currents in Pt. The rectified acoustic voltages depend on orbital-to-spin conversion and magnetoelastic coupling. Evidence of acoustic orbital pumping is also found.

Conclusion: Lattice dynamics are established as an efficient driver of orbital transport, enabling low-dissipation orbitronic devices that harness and sense phonons.

Abstract: Orbital currents provide a new degree of freedom for controlling magnetism,
yet their interaction with lattice dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here we
report a systematic investigation of the acoustic orbital Hall effect in light
metals such as Ti and Cr, where surface acoustic waves generate orbital
currents through phonon-orbital coupling. The acoustic orbital current in Ti
exhibits higher efficiency and longer diffusion length compared to the acoustic
spin current in Pt. The sign and magnitude of the rectified acoustic voltages
in nonmagnetic (Ti, Cr)/ferromagnetic (Ni, Co, Fe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$) bilayers are
determined by the product of orbital-to-spin conversion and magnetoelastic
coupling efficiencies of the ferromagnet. Additionally, we find evidence for
acoustic orbital pumping, whereby the excitation of ferromagnetic resonance by
surface acoustic waves injects an orbital current from the ferromagnet into the
nonmagnet. These results establish lattice dynamics as an efficient driver of
orbital transport, opening opportunities for low-dissipation orbitronic devices
that harness and sense phonons.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that in-plane magnetic fields can induce hybridization between spin-bright and spin-dark exciton transitions, leading to brightening of spin-dark excitons. The findings highlight a complex interplay of dark-bright splitting and linewidth differences in MoSe$_2$ monolayers.

Abstract: The linear absorption spectrum of excitons in TMDC monolayers under the

Result: Closed analytic forms for third-order nonlinear susceptibility, validated by Kramers--Kronig consistency checks, with small residuals.

Conclusion: The framework provides a predictive and parameter-transparent method to engineer third-order nonlinearity in hybrid quantum materials, clarifying the role of size and environment.

Abstract: This work presents a fully theoretical and self consistent framework for
calculating the third-order nonlinear susceptibility of CdSe/ZnS--MOF composite
quantum dots. The approach unifies finite-potential quantum confinement,the
Liouville von Neumann density matrix expansion to third order, and

quantized states and dipole matrix elements are obtained under the
effective-mass approximation with BenDaniel--Duke boundary conditions; closed
analytic forms for(including Lorentzian/Voigt broadening) follow from the
response expansion. Homogenization yields macroscopic scaling laws that link
microscopic descriptors (core radius, shell thickness, dielectric mismatch) to
bulk coefficients and. A Kramers--Kronig consistency check confirms causality

TL;DR: A four-bands model simplifies the study of Weyl points in TaAs family semimetals, enabling easier analysis of charge-carrier spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the electron energy spectra near Weyl points in topological semimetals (TaAs, TaP, NbAs, NbP) without relying on complex calculations.

Method: A four-bands model is developed to describe electron energy spectra near Weyl points, considering band-contact lines in mirror-reflection planes without spin-orbit interaction.

Result: Conditions for the existence of Weyl points, their positions in the Brillouin zone, and explicit band dispersion formulas are derived. Parameters for NbP are determined.

Conclusion: The four-bands model simplifies the analysis of the charge-carriers spectrum near Weyl points in TaAs family semimetals, avoiding complex band-structure calculations.

Abstract: We propose a four-bands model describing the electron energy spectra near the
Weyl points in the topological semimetals of the TaAs family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs,
NbP). This model takes into account the fact that these Weyl points result from
the band-contact lines which would exist in the mirror-reflection planes of
these materials if the spin-orbit interaction were absent in them. Within this
model, we obtain conditions for the existence of the Weyl points, determine
their positions in the Brillouin zone, and derive the explicit formula for
dispersion of the bands along the straight line connecting the two close Weyl
points with opposite topological charges. Using NbP as an example, the values
of the parameters defining the model spectrum are found. The obtained results
show that for the semimetals of the TaAs family, the charge-carriers spectrum
in the vicinity of the two close Weyl points can be analyzed without complex
band-structure calculations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which the anomalous Hall effect can occur in N\'eel ordered antiferromagnets, specifically focusing on two-dimensional models with two magnetic sublattices.

Method: Theoretical study of minimal models of N\'eel ordered collinear antiferromagnets on a square lattice, analyzing Turov's invariants and the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction and spin-orbit coupling.

Result: The anomalous Hall effect arises from the interplay of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the N\'eel order and spin-orbit coupling, contingent on broken symmetries of the system.

Conclusion: The anomalous Hall effect in N\'eel ordered antiferromagnets is allowed only for specific directions of the N\'eel order, determined by crystal lattice symmetries.

Abstract: In this paper we propose and theoretically study minimal models of all
N\'{e}el ordered collinear antiferromagnets which show the anomalous Hall
effect. For simplicity we consider two-dimensional models of antiferromagnets
with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. Examples of N\'{e}el ordered
ferrimagnet and of Dzyaloshinskii's weak ferromagnet are given. Turov's
invariants of existence of the magnetization in N\'{e}el ordered
antiferromagnets for proposed systems are analyzed. As a result, we obtain that
the anomalous Hall effect is allowed only for certain directions of the
N\'{e}el order defined by the crystal lattice symmetries. We derive the
mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets to be the interplay
of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the
N\'{e}el order, and the spin-orbit coupling consistent with the broken
symmetries that allowed for the Turov's invariant in the system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effects of statistical deformation on quantum statistical distributions and nonequilibrium thermodynamics, building upon previous work on the generalized Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

Method: The authors extended the generalized Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to the quantum domain by introducing Mittag-Leffler Bose-Einstein (MLBE) and Mittag-Leffler Fermi-Dirac (MLFD) distributions, incorporating a deformation parameter (α) to interpolate between bosonic and fermionic statistics.

Result: The MLBE distribution shows Bose-Einstein-like condensation without interactions, while the MLFD distribution exhibits negative heat capacity at low temperatures, demonstrating the role of deformation in thermodynamic behavior.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the significant impact of statistical deformation via the Mittag-Leffler function on thermodynamic behavior, revealing unconventional phenomena like Bose-Einstein-like condensation without interactions and negative heat capacity in low-temperature regimes.

Abstract: Building upon the framework established in our recent work [M. Seifi et al.,
Phys. Rev. E 111, 054114 (2025)], wherein a generalized Maxwell Boltzmann
distribution was formulated using the Mittag Leffler function within the
superstatistical formalism, we extend this approach to the quantum domain.
Specifically, we introduce two statistical distributions,termed the Mittag
Leffler Bose Einstein (MLBE) and Mittag Leffler Fermi Dirac (MLFD)
distributions, constructed by generalizing the conventional Bose-Einstein and
Fermi-Dirac distributions through the Mittag-Leffler function. This
generalization incorporates a deformation parameter (\alpha), which facilitates
a continuous interpolation between bosonic and fermionic statistics, while
inherently capturing nonequilibrium effects and generalized thermodynamic
behavior. We analyze the thermodynamic geometry associated with these
distributions and identify significant departures from standard statistical
models. Notably, the MLBE distribution manifests a Bose-Einstein-like
condensation even in the absence of interactions, whereas the MLFD distribution
exhibits unconventional features, such as negative heat capacity in the
low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the pivotal role of
statistical deformation in determining emergent macroscopic thermodynamic
phenomena.

TL;DR: Study shows topological-ordered liquid crystallizes via triplet diffusion, not nucleation, explaining glassy behavior in organic conductors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unique phase transition dynamics of topological-ordered liquids, which differ from conventional symmetry-breaking classifications and crystallization processes.

Method: The research employs the charge Ising model on a triangular lattice, focusing on the diffusive motion of triplets and conserved fluxes to study phase transition dynamics.

Result: The phase transition is driven by triplet diffusion, leading to glassy behavior and an unusually small Avrami exponent (~0.5), aligning with observations in organic conductors.

Conclusion: The study reveals that crystallization from a topological-ordered liquid involves anomalous dynamics driven by the diffusive motion of triplets, contrasting normal crystallization processes, and explains the charge glass behavior in certain organic conductors.

Abstract: Topological order characterizes a class of quantum and classical many-body
liquid states that escape the conventional classification by spontaneous
symmetry breaking. Many properties of the topological-ordered states still
await a clear understanding, and nature of phase transition dynamics is one of
them. Normally, when a liquid freezes into a solid, crystallization starts with
nucleation and a solid domain quickly grows on the surface of the expanding
nucleus, and the domains evolve into macroscopic size. In this work, we reveal
that the crystallization of the topological-ordered liquid proceeds in a
fundamentally different way. The topological-ordered phase is characterized by
a global conserved quantity and its conjugate fractional charge, which we call
a flux and a triplet in our working system of the charge Ising model on a
triangular lattice. In contrast to the normal crystallization process, the
phase transition is driven by the diffusive motion of triplets, which is
required to change the value of conserved fluxes to exit the
topological-ordered phase. In order to complete crystallization, triplets must
spend a divergently long time to diffuse over a macroscopic distance across the
system, which results in glassy behavior. Reflecting the diffusive motion of
triplets, the initial crystallization process shows slowing down with unusually
small Avrami exponent $\sim0.5$. These anomalous dynamics are specific to the
crystallization from topological-ordered liquid, and well account for the main
features of charge glass behavior exhibited by the organic conductors,
$\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X(SCN)$_4$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a generalized quantum statistical framework (alpha statistics) that interpolates between Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics, and extends into the hyperbosonic regime, with a focus on understanding its thermodynamic implications.

Method: The research employs thermodynamic geometry to analyze the thermodynamic curvature, using a modified occupation weight function parameterized by alpha.

Result: The framework reveals a crossover temperature marking the transition between Bose-like and Fermi-like regimes. For negative alpha (hyperbosonic statistics), curvature singularities indicate modified condensation phenomena distinct from conventional Bose condensation.

Conclusion: The study establishes a direct link between fractional exclusion principles and the thermodynamic curvature signatures, highlighting the distinct behaviors of bosonic and fermionic regimes under alpha statistics.

Abstract: We propose and study a generalized quantum statistical framework, referred to
as \emph{alpha statistics}, that continuously interpolates between
Bose--Einstein and Fermi--Dirac statistics and naturally extends into the
hyperbosonic regime for $\alpha < 0$. Inspired by Haldane's exclusion
statistics, this formulation introduces a modified occupation weight function
that encodes effective statistical interactions via the parameter $\alpha$.
Using thermodynamic geometry, we analyze the sign and singular behavior of the
thermodynamic curvature as a diagnostic of underlying interactions and phase
structures. A crossover temperature $T^{*}$, at which the curvature changes
sign, marks the transition between effectively attractive (Bose-like) and
repulsive (Fermi-like) statistical regimes. When expressed relative to the
Bose--Einstein condensation temperature $T_{c}$, the ratio $T^{*}/T_{c}$
depends universally on $\alpha$. For negative $\alpha$, corresponding to
hyperbosonic statistics, we find curvature singularities at specific
fugacities, indicating modified condensation phenomena distinct from
conventional Bose condensation. These results highlight the geometric and
thermodynamic consequences of alpha statistics and establish a link between
fractional exclusion principles and curvature-induced interaction signatures in
statistical thermodynamics.

Motivation: To understand quantum relaxation dynamics in the 1D N-flavor Gross-Neveu model after a Hamiltonian parameter quench.

Method: A time-dependent self-consistent Lindblad master equation is used to numerically describe the system dynamics.

Result: For a closed system, oscillations and revivals in the order parameter dynamics are observed. In the thermodynamic limit, the order parameter reaches its post-quench stationary value in accordance with ETH, while finite-momentum correlation matrix elements equilibrate only with non-zero system-reservoir coupling.

Conclusion: The study highlights subtle yet important aspects of post-quench relaxation dynamics in quantum many-body systems, particularly the role of system-reservoir coupling in equilibration.

Abstract: We study the quantum relaxation dynamics for a lattice version of the
one-dimensional (1D) $N$-flavor Gross-Neveu (GN) model after a Hamiltonian
parameter quench. Allowing for a system-reservoir coupling $\gamma$, we
numerically describe the system dynamics through a time-dependent
self-consistent Lindblad master equation. For a closed ($\gamma=0$) finite-size
system subjected to an interaction parameter quench, the order parameter
dynamics exhibits oscillations and revivals. In the thermodynamic limit, our
results imply that the order parameter reaches its post-quench stationary value
in accordance with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). However,
time-dependent finite-momentum correlation matrix elements equilibrate only if
$\gamma>0$. Our findings highlight subtle yet important aspects of the
post-quench relaxation dynamics of quantum many-body systems.
