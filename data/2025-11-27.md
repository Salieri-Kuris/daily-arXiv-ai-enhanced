### [1] [Strong-coupling theory of bilayer plasmon excitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20776)
*Hiroyuki Yamase,Luciano Zinni,Matías Bejas,Andrés Greco*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Strong-coupling theory applied to bilayer systems shows plasmon excitations similar to weak-coupling results, but with reduced particle-hole effects, suggesting experimental plasmon observations in cuprates align with the ω− mode.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive analysis regarding strong correlation effects in bilayer lattice systems, particularly for applications in cuprates.

Method: A strong-coupling theory was employed to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system using the t-J-V model, incorporating long-range Coulomb interaction.

Result: Plasmon excitations in the strong-coupling regime resemble those in the weak-coupling regime but with suppressed particle-hole excitations, allowing plasmons to remain well-defined over a wider momentum range.

Conclusion: The experimentally reported plasmon excitations in Y-based cuprates may correspond to the ω− mode, though further systematic experiments are needed for confirmation.

Abstract: Recently plasmon excitations in bilayer lattice systems were studied extensively in the weak-coupling regime. Unlike single-layer systems, these bilayers exhibit two distinct modes, $ω_{\pm}$, which show characteristic dependences upon the momentum and hopping integrals along the $z$ direction. To apply them to cuprates, strong correlation effects should be considered, but a comprehensive analysis has not yet been investigated. In this work, we present a strong-coupling theory to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system, utilizing the $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the long-range Coulomb interaction, $V$, on a lattice. Although our theoretical framework is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling approach, we find that resulting plasmon excitations are similar to those of a weak-coupling theory. A key distinction is that our strong-coupling framework reveals a noticeable suppression of particle-hole excitations, which allows the plasmon modes to remain well-defined over a wider region of momentum. We suggest that the experimentally reported plasmon excitations in Y-based cuprates can be described by the $ω_{-}$ mode, although we call for more systematic experiments to verify this.

### [2] [Hund-projected Kanamori model: an effective description of Hund's metals near the Mott insulating regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20788)
*Johan Carlström*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A Hund-projected Kanamori model is derived to study Hund's metals, capturing the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations, with insights into quasiparticle structure and interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interplay between electron correlations and metallic transport in Hund's metals by focusing on the role of Hund's coupling near the Mott insulating regime.

Method: Starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian, the study projects onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule, deriving an effective low-energy description.

Result: The model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system in the undoped limit with suppressed quantum fluctuations. Doping drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism, stronger than Nagaoka ferromagnetism.

Conclusion: The derived Hund-projected Kanamori model effectively bridges the Kanamori model with the emergent magnetic and transport phenomena of Hund's metals, providing a robust framework for studying quasiparticle structure and carrier interactions.

Abstract: Hund's coupling plays a decisive role in shaping electron correlations of multi-orbital systems, giving rise to a class of materials--Hund's metals--that combine local-moment physics with metallic transport. Here we derive an effective low-energy description of such a system near the Mott insulating regime, starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian and projecting onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule. The resulting Hund-projected Kanamori model captures the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations in the presence of strong Hund's coupling. In the undoped limit, the model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system with suppressed quantum fluctuations, approaching the classical limit for realistic five-band configurations. Upon doping, carrier motion couples strongly to the spin background and drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism analogous to, but much stronger than, Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Owing to its reduced sign problem, the model can be addressed with advanced path-integral methods to determine quasiparticle structure and effective interactions between carriers-quantities that are challenging to obtain with other methods. This framework establishes a microscopic bridge between the Kanamori model and the emergent magnetic and transport phenomena characteristic of Hund's metals.

### [3] [Defect Bootstrap: Tight Ground State Bounds in Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20860)
*Michael G. Scheer,Nisarg Chadha,Da-Chuan Lu,Eslam Khalaf*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A defect bootstrap framework tightens bounds in symmetry broken phases by addressing order parameter defects, validated in 1D and 2D Ising models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bootstrap methods become loose in symmetry broken phases due to the difficulty of capturing long-range order with local constraints. The goal is to address this limitation by resolving order parameter defects.

Method: A defect bootstrap framework is introduced by embedding the system into an auxiliary defect model with ancilla degrees of freedom, enabling local operators to remove order parameter defects.

Result: Improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions in the symmetry broken phase of transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D are obtained.

Conclusion: The defect bootstrap framework significantly improves bounds on local observables in symmetry broken phases, demonstrating the potential of physically motivated constraint sets to enhance bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: The recent development of bootstrap methods based on semidefinite relaxations of positivity constraints has enabled rigorous two-sided bounds on local observables directly in the thermodynamic limit. However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D. Our results demonstrate that physically motivated constraint sets can dramatically enhance the power of bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems.

Conclusion: 磁各向异性在调节SrRuO3中的Berry曲率和反常Nernst效应中起关键作用。

Abstract: We investigate the anomalous Nernst effect in epitaxial SrRuO$_3$ thin films grown on c-cut Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates, and in a polycrystalline SrRuO$_3$ slab. Through comprehensive measurements of the transverse thermoelectric response as a function of temperature and magnetic field, we observe a pronounced Nernst signal near $T_c$ in the (111) oriented SrRuO$_3$ thin films. The strong temperature and nontrivial field dependence underscore the pivotal role of the magnetic anisotropy in tuning the Berry curvature and, consequently, the anomalous Nernst effect in SrRuO$_3$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the antiferroquadrupolar order and the existence of an intermediate A phase in PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$.

Method: Field-angle-resolved magnetostriction and thermal-expansion measurements on PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$ under magnetic fields applied along the $[001]$ direction.

Result: Thermal expansion exhibits two qualitatively different anomalies, supporting the existence of the A phase, and the anisotropic coupling of the $O_{20}$ quadrupole plays a key role in stabilizing this phase.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that multipolar states in non-Kramers systems can be effectively tuned by magnetic-field orientation, providing insights into the anisotropic nature of quadrupolar interactions.

Abstract: We performed field-angle-resolved magnetostriction and thermal-expansion measurements on PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$, a cubic non-Kramers compound exhibiting antiferroquadrupolar order below $T_{\rm Q}=0.125$ K. Thermal expansion exhibits two qualitatively different anomalies under magnetic fields applied along the $[001]$ direction, providing experimental support for the existence of an intermediate A phase previously reported. Furthermore, comparison between the experimental results and theoretical modeling indicates a strong anisotropic coupling of the $O_{20}$ quadrupolar moment, which plays a key role in stabilizing the A phase. These findings demonstrate that multipolar states in non-Kramers systems can be effectively tuned by magnetic-field orientation, providing insights into the anisotropic nature of quadrupolar interactions.

### [6] [Helical Quasiperiodic Chains with Engineered Dissipation: Liouvillian Rapidity Diagnostics of Transport and Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21332)
*Mohammad Pouranvari*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Study shows dissipation patterns and quasiperiodic potential localization significantly impact relaxation dynamics in open quantum lattices, with uniform dissipation providing larger gaps and helical hopping enhancing relaxation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand how different dissipation patterns and quasiperiodic potential localization affect the relaxation dynamics and transport properties in engineered open quantum lattices.

Method: The study employs the third-quantization/Majorana covariance formalism to analyze the Liouvillian rapidities and their gaps under various spatial dissipation patterns (uniform, single-site, two-site, and pairwise gain/loss) in a quadratic spinless-fermion helical chain with quasiperiodic potential.

Result: Uniform dissipation yields large, weakly λ-dependent gaps, while sparse local dissipation produces rapidly shrinking gaps as the quasiperiodic potential induces localization. Increasing the helical hopping enhances relaxation by improving mode overlap with dissipative channels.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that Liouvillian rapidities serve as effective diagnostics for relaxation and sensitivity in open quantum lattices, with dissipation patterns and quasiperiodic potential localization significantly influencing the rapidity gap.

Abstract: We study relaxation spectra of a quadratic spinless--fermion helical chain with an Aubry--Andre--type quasiperiodic potential and a single N--th neighbor (helical) hopping. Dissipation and pumping are introduced via local linear Lindblad jump operators and treated exactly using the third--quantization / Majorana covariance formalism. Focusing on periodic boundary conditions (to avoid edge artefacts) we compute the Liouvillian rapidities and their smallest nonzero real part (the rapidity gap) for several spatial dissipation patterns: uniform (all), single--site (one--site) and two--site (two--site) placement, plus pairwise gain/loss on helical partner sites. We show that uniform dissipation yields large, weakly lambda--dependent gaps, while sparse local dissipation produces gaps that shrink rapidly as the quasiperiodic potential lambda induces localization. Increasing t_N enhances relaxation by improving mode overlap with dissipative channels. Finite--size scaling, rapidity level statistics (Poisson vs Wigner--Dyson), and spatial profiles of slow modes provide a consistent picture linking Liouvillian spectral structure to transport and localization. Our results highlight Liouvillian rapidities as compact, experimentally relevant diagnostics of relaxation and sensitivity in engineered open quantum lattices.

### [7] [Charge carrier relaxation dynamics in the one-dimensional Kondo lattice model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21539)
*Arturo Perez-Romero,Mica Schwarm,Fabian Heidrich-Meisner*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper studies thermalization in the Kondo lattice model, showing it occurs under specific conditions despite non-thermalization in simpler scenarios, supported by real-time simulations and finite-temperature comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the relaxation and thermalization dynamics of optically excited charge carriers in the Kondo lattice model, particularly focusing on the role of magnetic excitations in these processes.

Method: The research employs the time-dependent Lanczos method to simulate real-time dynamics, focusing on spin polarization, local spin-spin correlations, and electronic momentum distribution. Comparisons with finite-temperature expectation values and gap ratio analysis further validate the results.

Result: The findings reveal thermalization in the stationary state when conditions of finite electronic filling or a magnetic background in the singlet sector are met, unlike simpler cases where no thermalization occurs.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the stationary state in the Kondo lattice model is compatible with thermalization under specific conditions, contrasting with non-thermalization observed in simpler cases. The real-time simulations and comparisons with finite-temperature expectation values support these findings.

Abstract: A generic question in the field of ultrafast dynamics is concerned with the relaxation dynamics and the subsequent thermalization of optically excited charge carriers. Among several possible relaxation channels available in a solid-state system, we focus on the coupling to magnetic excitations. In this paper, we study the real-time dynamics of a paradigmatic model, the Kondo lattice model in one dimension. We conduct a comprehensive study of the relaxation processes by evaluating the spin polarization of the conduction electron, the local spin-spin correlation between localized and conduction electrons, and the electronic momentum distribution. While in the well-studied cases of one or two charge carriers in a ferromagnetic background, no thermalization occurs, we demonstrate that the stationary state is compatible with thermalization if either the electronic filling is finite or the magnetic background is in the singlet sector. Our real-time simulations using the time-dependent Lanczos method are corroborated by a direct comparison with finite-temperature expectation values and an analysis of the spectrum in terms of the gap ratio.

Abstract: High magnetic fields provide a direct route to probe the anisotropies that govern spin dynamics in layered magnets. Using the SU(3) bond operator framework for spin 1 systems, we derive analytic expressions for the magnon spectrum and the critical fields delimiting the field induced ordered phase. We show that the upper critical field $h_{c2}$ carries a simple and quantitative fingerprint of both exchange anisotropy and single ion symmetry breaking, enabling high field experiments to serve as sensitive probes of microscopic anisotropy. We further map how these anisotropies, together with interlayer coupling, control the extent and location of the magnon Bose Einstein condensation dome. Our results provide experimentally accessible criteria for identifying symmetry breaking mechanisms in real spin 1 materials.

Abstract: To this day, high-temperature cuprate superconductors remain an unparalleled platform for studying the competition and coexistence of emergent, static and dynamic, quantum phases of matter exhibiting high transition temperature non-s-wave superconductivity, non-Fermi liquid transport and a still enigmatic pseudogap regime. However, how superconductivity emerges alongside and competes with the pseudogap regime remains an open question. Here, we present a high-resolution, time- and angle-resolved photoemission study of the near-antinodal region of optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$. For a sufficiently high excitation fluence, we disrupt superconductivity and drive a transient change from a symmetric superconducting-like to an asymmetric pseudogap-like density of states, for electronic temperatures well below the equilibrium superconducting critical temperature. Conversely, when the superconductivity is fully restored, the pseudogap is suppressed, as signaled by a fully particle-hole symmetric density of states. A unique aspect of our experiments is that the pseudogap coexists with superconducting features at intermediate times or at intermediate fluence. Our findings challenge the paradigm that superconductivity emerges by establishing phase coherence in the pseudogap. Instead, our experimental results, supported by phenomenological theory, demonstrate that the two states compete, and that the low-temperature ground state of the cuprates originates from a competition between superconducting and pseudogap states.

TL;DR: Pressure-driven suppression of CDW in RbV3Sb5 enhances superconductivity, with critical current peaks highlighting complex interactions between CDW and superconducting states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how competing orders like charge-density waves affect superconductivity, and to optimize superconductivity by identifying and analyzing these competing mechanisms.

Method: The researchers used the self-field critical current (Ic,sf) to investigate pressure-tuned superconductivity and its interaction with the charge-density wave (CDW) state in RbV3Sb5.

Result: As pressure destabilizes the CDW state, the self-field critical current (Ic,sf) enhances significantly, peaking near the critical pressure where CDW is suppressed. A weaker Ic,sf peak was also observed within the CDW phase, accompanied by a shift in the superconducting transition temperature trend.

Conclusion: The study highlights the complex interplay between superconductivity and CDW in RbV3Sb5, suggesting sudden changes in CDW patterns or Lifshitz transitions as key factors influencing superconducting properties under pressure. Microscopic examination of the CDW state is essential for a deeper understanding.

Abstract: Superconductivity can coexist or compete with other orders such as magnetism or density waves. Optimizing superconductivity requires identifying competing orders that may disrupt Cooper pair coherence. Here, we use the self-field critical current ($I_{\rm c,sf}$) to probe pressure-tuned superconductivity in the kagome superconductor RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. As pressure destabilizes the charge-density wave (CDW) state, $I_{\rm c,sf}$ drastically enhances, peaking near the critical pressure where the CDW state is completely suppressed at zero temperature. Surprisingly, a weaker $I_{\rm c,sf}$ peak emerges within the CDW phase. Near the pressure of the weaker peak, the superconducting phase transition temperature shifts from an increasing trend with pressure to a near plateau. Our analysis suggests the possibility of a sudden change in the CDW pattern or a Lifshitz transition, highlighting the need for microscopic examinations of the CDW state for understanding the pressure evolution of superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.

TL;DR: Stabilizing tetragonal phase in nickelates via Al doping reveals suppression of superconductivity and provides insights into the role of nonmagnetic impurities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve ambient-pressure high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in nickelates by stabilizing the tetragonal phase, and to understand the impact of nonmagnetic impurities on metallicity and superconductivity.

Method: Employing the Goldschmidt tolerance factor to stabilize the tetragonal phase via aluminum doping and post-annealing under moderately high oxygen pressure, followed by X-ray and neutron diffraction, resistance measurements, and analysis of magnetic and transport properties.

Result: Tetragonal I4/mmm structure was stabilized for Al-doped samples; Al doping induced semiconducting properties, localized magnetic moments, and spin-glass-like behaviors at low temperatures. Even low Al doping (x = 0.05) suppressed superconductivity under high pressure.

Conclusion: Al doping suppresses superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and provides insights into the role of nonmagnetic impurities in metallicity and superconductivity, aiding in understanding the superconducting mechanism in RP nickelates.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the tetragonal phase of the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer nickelate, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ or La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, which is stabilized under high pressures, is responsible for high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC). In this context, realization of the tetragonal phase at ambient pressure could be a rational step to achieve the goal of ambient-pressure HTSC in the nickelate system. By employing the concept of Goldschmidt tolerance factor, we succeed in stabilizing the tetragonal phase by aluminum doping together with post annealing under moderately high oxygen pressure. X-ray and neutron diffractions verify the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure for the post-annealed samples La$_3$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_x$O$_{7-δ}$ (0.3 $\leq x \leq$ 0.5). The Al-doped samples, including the tetragonal ones, show semiconducting properties, carry localized magnetic moments, and exhibit spin-glass-like behaviors at low temperatures, all of which can be explained in terms of charge carrier localization. Furthermore, high-pressure resistance measurements on post-annealed samples reveal that even a low Al doping ($x$ = 0.05) suppresses superconductivity almost completely. This work gives information about the effect of nonmagnetic impurity on metallicity as well as superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, which would contribute to understanding the superconducting mechanism in RP nickelates.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Edge states in gapped bilayer graphene conduct within the band gap and generate non-local resistance, dependent on edge termination but not topological effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to understand the behavior of edge states in gBLG, particularly their conduction within the band gap and the potential to generate non-local resistance, as observed in recent experiments.

Method: The research investigated electronic transport in gBLG devices with various edge terminations (zigzag, armchair, bearded) and analyzed the resulting edge state conduction. Band structure calculations of gBLG nanoribbons were performed to validate the findings.

Result: Edge states were observed to conduct within the band gap of gBLG, with their localization and existence heavily influenced by edge termination. The study confirmed that these states are not topologically protected.

Conclusion: The study concludes that edge states in gapped bilayer graphene (gBLG) exhibit conduction within the band gap, which can generate non-local resistance. These states are highly dependent on edge termination and do not stem from topological bulk-boundary effects.

Abstract: We investigate electronic transport in gapped bilayer graphene (gBLG) devices. For certain edge terminations -typically a combination of zigzag, armchair, and bearded types - we observe edge state conduction within the band gap, which is opened by a potential bias between the two layers. The edge states can generate a non-local resistance, in line with recent experiments [1]. Band structure calculations of gBLG nanoribbons corroborate the existence of the edge states, whose edge localization can be switched by tuning the electron energy. Their existence strongly depends on the edge termination and does not originate from a topological bulk-boundary correspondence.

Result: The maximum local thermal conductivity exceeds the uniform heating case by up to 27%, and reducing hotspot spacing can enhance the heat flux by up to 40%.

Conclusion: This work challenges the conventional view that thermal transport capability is spatially uniform throughout nanoscale systems and provides fundamental insights for thermal management in high-power-density integrated circuits.

Abstract: Understanding nanoscale hotspot thermal transport is crucial in electronic devices. Contrary to common perception, recent experiments show that closely spaced nanoscale multiple hotspots can enhance heat dissipation. Here, the thermal transport in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems is investigated by solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The local thermal conductivity is proposed to describe the non-uniform spatial distribution of heat transport capability in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems. The maximum value exceeds the uniform heating case by up to 27%, which is attributed to the spatially varying fraction of unscattered phonons emitted from hotspots. Moreover, the effects and mechanisms of hotspot spacing on thermal transport are investigated, showing that reducing the hotspot spacing can enhance the heat flux by up to 40%. This work challenges the conventional view that thermal transport capability is spatially uniform throughout the system and provides fundamental insights for thermal management in high-power-density integrated circuits.

Abstract: Artificial spin ice (ASI) systems exhibit fascinating phenomena, such as frustration and the formation of magnetic monopole states, and Dirac strings. However, exploring the wave phenomena in these systems is elusive due to the weak dipolar coupling that governs their interactions. In this study, we demonstrate coherent spin-wave propagation in an hybrid ASI system, which is based on a multilayered ferromagnetic thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and in-plane magnetized nanoelements embedded within it. We show that this system enables spin-wave transmission over a one-micrometer distance via exchange-mediated coupling between subsystems and evanescent spin-wave tunneling through the out-of-plane magnetized parts. This system overcomes the limitations of purely dipolar interactions in standard ASIs while preserving their fundamental properties. Thus, it provides a platform for studying spin-wave phenomena in frustrated ASI systems and paves the way for exploiting them in analog signal processing with spin waves.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that torsion-induced Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (tiDMI) can lift chiral degeneracy in helimagnets and proposes an experimental method to observe this effect.

Abstract: It has been shown that in magnets possessing an inversion center in the absence of deformations, a torsion-induced Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (tiDMI) can arise. A microscopic mechanism for this interaction is described, involving the transfer of angular momentum to the lattice upon electron reflection from the magnet's boundary. An estimate of the tiDMI constant is provided. It is demonstrated that tiDMI can lift the chiral degeneracy in helimagnets, and a way for experimentally observing this effect is proposed.

TL;DR: Optimizing nanowire and superconductor sizes for Majorana fermions reveals current experimental devices may be too small.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between theoretical predictions of Majorana fermions in idealized one-dimensional systems and experimental challenges due to finite-size deviations.

Method: Investigates finite-size effects of nanowire and superconductor, optimizing their dimensions to ensure a single Majorana fermion per end.

Result: Optimal nanowire dimensions are less than 100nm in width and ~1nm in thickness; superconductor thickness must exceed its coherence length (e.g., Al films ~1000nm).

Conclusion: The study identifies optimal sizes for nanowire and superconductor layers in heterostructures to ensure the existence of Majorana fermions, explaining why current experiments may fail to observe them and providing guidance for future research.

Abstract: Majorana fermions (zero modes) are predicted to emerge in nanowire-superconductor heterostructures. This theoretical prediction typically relies on an oversimplified model, where both the nanowire and the superconductor are idealized as one-dimensional systems. In reality, heterostructures have finite sizes that deviate from this idealization-and as a result, smoking-gun evidence confirming the existence of these zero modes remains elusive. Here, we investigate the finite-size effects of both the nanowire and the superconductor, and optimize their sizes to ensure that only one Majorana fermion exists at each end of the heterostructure. It is discovered that the optimal transverse sizes of the nanowire are less than 100nm in width and approximately 1nm in thickness. For the superconductor layer, its optimal thickness (a key aspect of its size) must exceed its coherence length. We also present the optimal sizes of the two types of materials used in the experiment in a quantitative manner. Notably, the identified optimal thickness of the superconductor (Al films, $\sim$1000nm)--a critical size parameter--is two orders of magnitude larger than the thickness of Al films currently utilized in experimental devices (e.g., InSb-Al and InAs-Al heterostructures). Our findings could explain why Majorana fermions have not been observed in current experiments, and offer guidance for the size selection of heterostructures to implement Majorana fermions in future studies.

TL;DR: A method for tuning nonlinear photoresponse in 2D semiconductors using an electric field, validated by predicting shift currents and tunable responses in layered materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and predict the nonlinear photoresponse of two-dimensional semiconductors through explicit incorporation of an electric field, enabling tunable and emergent photocurrents.

Method: Developed a method to electrically tune nonlinear photoresponse by incorporating a static out-of-plane electric field into the electronic ground state, using a Wannier-interpolated Hamiltonian with field modifications through position matrix elements.

Result: The approach captures finite shift current in centrosymmetric bilayers and tunability of responses in polar structures, with conductivity behavior reflecting competition between shift vector growth and interband coupling weakening.

Conclusion: Field dressing of Wannier Hamiltonians is established as a practical route to model and predict nonlinear photocurrents in layered materials, demonstrated through the tunability and emergence of shift currents in centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric systems.

Abstract: We develop a practical approach to electrically tuning the nonlinear photoresponse of two-dimensional semiconductors by explicitly incorporating a static out-of-plane electric field into the electronic ground state prior to optical excitation, as a gate bias. The method is implemented by dressing a Wannier-interpolated Hamiltonian with the field through its position matrix elements, which allows the gate bias to modify orbital hybridization and band dispersion beyond perturbative treatments. Within the independent-particle approximation, the resulting second-order (shift) conductivity is evaluated for both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric layered systems. Applied to MoS$_2$, the approach captures the emergence of a finite shift current in centrosymmetric bilayers and the tunability of intrinsic responses in polar structures. The shift conductivity rises linearly at small fields and saturates at higher intensities, reflecting the competition between the growing shift vector and the weakening interband coupling as resonant transitions move away from high-symmetry valleys. A Taylor expansion of the field-dressed conductivity connects this behavior to the third-order optical response, revealing a unified picture of field-induced nonlinearities. These results establish field dressing of Wannier Hamiltonians as a practical route to model and predict nonlinear photocurrents in layered materials.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A framework for analyzing exciton symmetries using group theory and total crystal angular momentum, applied to LiF, MoSe2, and hBN to study optical absorption, exciton-phonon coupling, and luminescence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the symmetries of excitonic states, which have been less studied despite the accuracy of current ab initio methods in determining exciton energies and eigenstates.

Method: The authors employ standard group-theory methods to analyze the transformation properties of excitonic states obtained by solving the BSE, and introduce the concept of total crystal angular momentum for excitons.

Result: The methodology is applied to three prototypical systems (LiF, monolayer MoSe2, and bulk hBN) to demonstrate the role of symmetries in exciton behavior, including optical absorption, exciton-phonon interactions, and phonon-assisted luminescence.

Conclusion: This work establishes a general and robust framework for understanding the symmetry properties of excitons in crystals, providing a foundation for future studies.

Abstract: Excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, are responsible for strong optical resonances near the bandgap in low-dimensional materials and wide-bandgap insulators. Although current ab initio methods can accurately determine exciton energies and eigenstates, their symmetries have been much less explored. In this work, we employ standard group-theory methods to analyse the transformation properties of excitonic states, obtained by solving the BSE, under crystal symmetry operations. We develop an approach to assign irreducible-representation labels to excitonic states, providing a state-of-the-art framework for analysing their symmetries and selection rules (including, for example, the case of exciton-phonon coupling). Complementary to the symmetry classification, we introduce the concept of total crystal angular momentum for excitons in the presence of rotational symmetries, allowing the derivation of conservation laws. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these symmetry properties can be exploited to greatly enhance the computational efficiency of exciton calculations with the BSE. We apply our methodology to three prototypical systems to understand the role of symmetries in different contexts: (i) For LiF, we present the symmetry analysis of the entire excitonic dispersion and examine the selection rules for optical absorption. (ii) In the calculation of resonant Raman spectra of monolayer MoSe2, we demonstrate how the conservation of total crystal angular momentum governs exciton-phonon interactions, leading to the observed resonant enhancement. (iii) In bulk hBN, we analyze the role of symmetries for the coupling of finite-momentum excitons to finite-momentum phonons and their manifestation in the phonon-assisted luminescence spectra. This work establishes a general and robust framework for understanding the symmetry properties of excitons in crystals, providing a foundation for future studies.

Abstract: Optical memristors are innovative devices that enable the integration of electro-optical functionalities - such as light modulation, multilevel optical memory, and nonvolatile reprogramming - into neuromorphic networks. Recently, their capabilities have expanded with the development of light-emitting memristors, which operate through various emission mechanisms. One notable process involves the electroluminescence of defects generated within the switching matrix during device activation. In this study, we explore the early-stage formation and evolution of the species responsible for light emission in Ag-based in-plane memristors. Our approach combines electrical stimulation with correlated optical electroluminescence and photoluminescence measurements. The findings provide valuable insights into controlling emission processes in memristors, paving the way for their integration as essential components in neuromorphic circuits.

### [20] [Centipedes Leap into the Quantum Realm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20690)
*Kaytki Chakankar,Xinhui Tang,Yiguo Zhang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum strategies in the centipede game outperform classical approaches, yielding better payoffs and more realistic outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address the discrepancy between the classical, rational solution of the centipede game (defection in the first round) and the observed real-life player behavior (frequent cooperation).

Method: The authors employed quantum mechanics principles to analyze the centipede game, implemented their algorithm on Qiskit, and compared the outcomes with classical strategies like backward induction.

Result: The results showed that quantum strategies led to two new Nash equilibria with better payoffs for both players and a closer match to real-life game outcomes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that applying quantum strategies in the centipede game yields superior Nash equilibria compared to classical solutions, and suggests a generalized conjecture for similar quantum games.

Abstract: The centipede game is a two-player non-zero-sum game. Each turn, a player can choose whether they want to take or pass a growing reward. The classical, rational solution of this game shows defection in the first round, when in reality, players cooperate much more often. Inspired by prior work employing quantum strategies in the prisoners dilemma, we showed that when similar quantum mechanics principles are applied to the centipede game, it leads to two new quantum Nash equilibria that are superior to the classical solution. Furthermore, by implementing our algorithm on Qiskit, we confirmed that leveraging quantum strategies, rather than strategies like backward induction, to solve the centipede game provided better payoffs for both players and more accurately modeled the games real-life outcomes. Ultimately, we propose a generalized conjecture for similarly structured quantum games.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: First-order relativistic corrections to QSLs were derived, showing increased bounds and phase drift, with a proposed experimental test using a Penning trap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for quantum-speed limits (QSLs) in satellite QKD, gravitational-wave detectors, and clock networks neglect relativistic effects. This work addresses the gap by including these effects for coherent and squeezed probes.

Method: Derived first-order relativistic corrections to the Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin bounds using the Foldy-Wouthuysen expansion and treated perturbations as harmonic oscillators. Gaussian state propagation was used to obtain closed-form QSLs and the quantum Cramér-Rao bound.

Result: Relativistic effects slow evolution in an amplitude- and squeezing-dependent manner, increase both QSL bounds, and introduce a phase drift that reduces timing sensitivity while slightly increasing the squeeze factor. An experimental setup with a Penning trap could detect the predicted drift within 15 minutes.

Conclusion: The derived relativistic corrections to the QSLs provide benchmarks for continuous-variable systems and suggest a feasible experimental test in high-velocity or strong-field regimes using a Penning trap setup.

Abstract: Timing and phase resolution in satellite QKD, kilometre-scale gravitational-wave detectors, and space-borne clock networks hinge on quantum-speed limits (QSLs), yet benchmarks omit relativistic effects for coherent and squeezed probes. We derive first-order relativistic corrections to the Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin bounds. Starting from the Foldy-Wouthuysen expansion and treating $-p^{4}/(8 m^{3} c^{2})$ as a harmonic-oscillator perturbation, we propagate Gaussian states to obtain closed-form QSLs and the quantum Cramér-Rao bound. Relativistic kinematics slow evolution in an amplitude- and squeezing-dependent way, increase both bounds, and introduce an $ε^{2} t^{2}$ phase drift that weakens timing sensitivity while modestly increasing the squeeze factor. A single electron ($ε\approx 1.5\times 10^{-10}$) in a $5.4\,\mathrm{T}$ Penning trap, read out with $149\,\mathrm{GHz}$ quantum-limited balanced homodyne, should reveal this drift within $\sim 15\,\mathrm{min}$ -- within known hold times. These results benchmark relativistic corrections in continuous-variable systems and point to an accessible test of the quantum speed limit in high-velocity or strong-field regimes.

TL;DR: Clarifies that classical gravity cannot mediate entanglement, reinforcing the need for nonclassical gravitational degrees for such phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address discrepancies in the analysis of entanglement generation by classical gravitational fields and reinforce the BMV inference.

Method: Restating the critique, providing a channel-theoretic reformulation, and clarifying distinctions between entanglement activation and genuine mediation.

Result: The interaction becomes ultra-local in the nonrelativistic limit, and no entanglement is generated from a product input.

Conclusion: The standard BMV inference that observing gravity-mediated entanglement strongly indicates nonclassical gravitational degrees of freedom remains valid after clarifications.

Abstract: A recent paper by Aziz and Howl (Nature 2025) argues that, once quantum matter is described at the level of quantum field theory and coupled to a classical gravitational field, higher order processes can generate entanglement between two spatially separated masses. A contemporaneous critical note (Marletto, Oppenheim, Vedral, Wilson, arXiv:2511.07348v1) shows that, in the actual nonrelativistic limit employed there, the interaction becomes ultra local, the total unitary factorizes, and no entanglement is generated from a product input. In this comment we (i) restate the core point of that critique, (ii) give a channel theoretic reformulation that makes the conclusion model independent, and (iii) clarify the distinction between activation of entanglement in already quantum matter and genuine mediation of entanglement by a classical field. Once these clarifications are in place, the standard BMV inference that observation of gravity mediated entanglement strongly indicates nonclassical gravitational degrees of freedom remains intact.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Aurora-DD, an offline-optimized phase-coherence compensator combined with XY8 DD, significantly improves phase bias suppression on NISQ devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a practical and stable phase-coherence compensation method for NISQ devices that suppresses both dephasing and systematic phase bias.

Method: Aurora-DD integrates a sign-based feedback update of a global phase offset (Delta phi) with a fixed-depth XY8 dynamical decoupling (DD) scaffold. Feedback optimization is performed offline on a calibrated emulator, and the resulting Delta phi* is deployed as pre-calibrated phase compensation on hardware.

Result: Aurora-DD achieves 68-97% improvement in mean-squared error across phase settings on an emulator and approximately 99.2-99.6% reduction in absolute error on real superconducting hardware (ibm_fez) compared to a no-DD baseline.

Conclusion: The combined results support pre-calibrated Aurora-DD as a practical, stable, and hardware-compatible phase-coherence compensator for NISQ devices in single-qubit settings.

Abstract: We present an emulator-based and hardware feasibility study of Aurora-DD, a phase-coherence compensation method that integrates a sign-based feedback update of a global phase offset (Delta phi) with a fixed-depth XY8 dynamical decoupling (DD) scaffold. The feedback optimization is performed offline on a calibrated emulator and the resulting Delta phi* is deployed as pre-calibrated phase compensation on hardware. This represents an "offline closed-loop, online open-loop" feasibility demonstration. Using an Aer-based emulator calibrated with ibm_fez device parameters, Aurora-DD achieves substantial reductions in mean-squared error of the measured expectation value <Z>, yielding 68-97% improvement across phase settings phi = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 over n=30 randomized trials. These large-n emulator results provide statistically stable evidence that the combined effect of XY8 and Delta phi* suppresses both dephasing and systematic phase bias. On real superconducting hardware (ibm_fez), we perform a small-sample (n=3) multi-phase validation campaign. Aurora-DD yields point estimates corresponding to approximately 99.2-99.6% reduction in absolute error relative to a no-DD baseline across all tested phase points. These hardware numbers are reported transparently as feasibility evidence under tight queue and credit constraints. In contrast, the auxiliary Aurora+ZNE branch exhibits instability: shallow two-point ZNE occasionally amplifies calibration inconsistencies and produces large error outliers. We therefore relegate ZNE analysis to the Appendix and position Aurora-DD (without ZNE) as the primary contribution. Overall, the combined results support pre-calibrated Aurora-DD as a practical, stable, and hardware-compatible phase-coherence compensator for NISQ devices in single-qubit settings.

Motivation: To achieve precise control over eNe charge states for quantum computing by tracking and managing the growth of solid Ne films on superconducting circuit surfaces.

Method: The study utilized high-transition-temperature (high-T_c) YBCO microwave resonators to monitor and control Ne film growth in real-time, conducting over 300 solidification experiments.

Result: The final Ne film thickness varied stochastically from a few nm to a few μm. Increasing resonator driving power consistently reduced thickness to below 100 nm.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate progress in controlling Ne film growth for eNe qubits, highlighting the broader potential of high-T_c resonators in hybrid quantum systems.

Abstract: Electron-on-neon (eNe) charge states coupled to superconducting circuits are a promising platform for quantum computing. Control over the formation of these charge states requires techniques to track and control the growth of solid Ne films on the circuit surface. We demonstrate a real-time Ne film-growth monitor using high-transition-temperature (high-$T_c$) YBCO microwave resonators. The high $T_c$ enables tracking of the film thickness near Ne's triple temperature and below. Across more than 300 solidification experiments, we find that the final Ne thickness varies stochastically from a few nm to a few $μ$m for films solidified from the liquid phase. By increasing the driving power in the resonator, we consistently reduce the final thickness to below 100 nm. These results represent an important step toward controlled formation of Ne films for eNe qubits and highlight the broader utility of high-$T_c$ resonators for hybrid quantum systems.

Abstract: The integration of Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers into diamond anvil cells has opened the door to quantum sensing at megabar pressures. Despite a multitude of experimental demonstrations and applications ranging from quantum materials to geophysics, a detailed microscopic understanding of how stress affects the NV center remains lacking. In this work, using a combination of first principles calculations as well as high-pressure NV experiments, we develop a complete description of the NV's optical properties under general stress conditions. In particular, our ab initio calculations reveal the complex behavior of the NV's inter-system crossing rates under stresses that both preserve and break the defect's symmetry. Crucially, our proposed framework immediately resolves a number of open questions in the field, including: (i) the microscopic origin of the observed contrast-enhancement in (111)-oriented anvils, and (ii) the surprising observation of NV contrast-inversion in certain high-pressure regimes. Our work lays the foundation for optimizing the performance of NV high-pressure sensors by controlling the local stress environment, and more generally, suggests that symmetry-breaking stresses can be utilized as a novel tuning knob for generic solid-state spin defects.

Abstract: Introducing new components and functionalities into quantum devices is critical in advancing state-of-the-art hardware. Here, we propose superconducting diodes (SDs) as a coherent nonreciprocal element in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures. In particular, we use an asymmetric SQUID as an SD controlled with a flux bias. We spectroscopically characterize SD and show that flux bias acts cooperatively with the nonlinear diode response to induce direction-dependent resonance shifts in the transmission spectrum. We use the SD as an elementary component to realize coherent nonreciprocal qubit-qubit coupling. With a minimal two qubit system, we demonstrate a nonreciprocal half-iSWAP gate with tunable Bell-state generation, thereby showcasing the potential of intrinsic nonreciprocity as a tool in coherent control in quantum technologies. Our work enables high-fidelity signal routing and entanglement generation in all-to-all connected microwave quantum networks, where nonreciprocity is embedded at the device level.

TL;DR: Riemannian optimization enables RCMPS to handle multi-field models, demonstrated on two interacting scalar fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of RCMPS being restricted to single-field models due to divergence issues in multi-field scenarios.

Method: Riemannian optimization framework to minimize energy density over the regular submanifold of multi-field RCMPS.

Result: Successfully applied to a model of two interacting scalar fields, capturing symmetry-breaking phases and a BKT transition.

Conclusion: RCMPS now applicable to a wider range of problems due to the introduction of a Riemannian optimization framework.

Abstract: Relativistic continuous matrix product states (RCMPS) are a powerful variational ansatz for quantum field theories of a single field. However, they inherit a property of their non-relativistic counterpart that makes them divergent for models with multiple fields, unless a regularity condition is satisfied. This has so far restricted the use of RCMPS to toy models with a single self-interacting field. We address this long standing problem by introducing a Riemannian optimization framework, that allows to minimize the energy density over the regular submanifold of multi-field RCMPS, and thus to retain purely variational results. We demonstrate its power on a model of two interacting scalar fields in $1+1$ dimensions. The method captures distinct symmetry-breaking phases, and the signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition along an $O(2)$-symmetric parameter line. This makes RCMPS usable for a far larger class of problems than before.

Method: The review introduces fundamental aspects of major computational electromagnetics (CEM) techniques and discusses advanced topics related to multiscale device modeling, using superconducting circuit quantum devices as specific examples.

Result: The review offers insights into choosing appropriate CEM techniques and provides steps to mitigate challenges, particularly for modeling multiscale devices.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a discussion on future research directions aimed at improving the design of sophisticated superconducting circuit quantum devices, emphasizing the broader applicability of the insights provided.

Abstract: High-fidelity numerical methods that model the physical layout of a device are essential for the design of many technologies. For methods that characterize electromagnetic effects, these numerical methods are referred to as computational electromagnetics (CEM) methods. Although the CEM research field is mature, emerging applications can still stress the capabilities of the techniques in use today. The design of superconducting circuit quantum devices falls in this category due to the unconventional material properties and important features of the devices covering nanometer to centimeter scales. Such multiscale devices can stress the fundamental properties of CEM tools which can lead to an increase in simulation times, a loss in accuracy, or even cause no solution to be reliably found. While these challenges are being investigated by CEM researchers, knowledge about them is limited in the broader community of users of these CEM tools. This review is meant to serve as a practical introduction to the fundamental aspects of the major CEM techniques that a researcher may need to choose between to model a device, as well as provide insight into what steps they may take to alleviate some of their challenges. Our focus is on highlighting the main concepts without rigorously deriving all the details, which can be found in many textbooks and articles. After covering the fundamentals, we discuss more advanced topics related to the challenges of modeling multiscale devices with specific examples from superconducting circuit quantum devices. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions that will be valuable for improving the ability to successfully design increasingly more sophisticated superconducting circuit quantum devices. Although our focus and examples are taken from this area, researchers from other fields will still benefit from the details discussed here.

TL;DR: The paper introduces higher-order Zeno sequences to enhance the convergence rate of quantum Zeno dynamics, achieving better error scaling and linking it to Trotter formulas and dynamical decoupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the error scaling in quantum Zeno dynamics from the typical O(1/N) to faster convergence rates (O(1/N^{2k}) by leveraging higher-order sequences inspired by Trotter formulas.

Method: The method involves developing higher-order Zeno sequences based on higher-order Trotter formulas to achieve faster convergence to Zeno dynamics, with improved error scaling. It includes the use of frequent projective measurements, unitary kicks, and periodic control fields.

Result: The result demonstrates the development of higher-order Zeno sequences that achieve improved error scaling (O(1/N^{2k}) and presents explicit control fields for second-order improvements, along with shorter Zeno sequences.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by exploring the connection between higher-order Zeno sequences and dynamical decoupling techniques, suggesting more efficient implementations in the weak coupling regime.

Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect typically refers to freezing the dynamics of a quantum system through frequent observations. In general, quantum Zeno dynamics is obtained with an error of order $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$, where $N$ is the number of projective measurements performed within a fixed evolution time. In this work, we develop higher-order Zeno sequences that achieve faster convergence to Zeno dynamics, yielding an improved error scaling of $\mathcal{O}(1/N^{2k})$, where $k$ describes the order of the Zeno sequence. This is achieved by relating higher-order Zeno sequences to higher-order Trotter formulas that achieve similar convergence behavior. We leverage this relation to develop higher-order Zeno sequences for different manifestations of the quantum Zeno effect, including frequent projective measurements and unitary kicks. We go on to discuss achieving quantum Zeno dynamics through periodic control fields of high frequency. We explicitly develop control fields that yield a second-order type improvement in the Zeno error scaling and present shorter Zeno sequences. Finally, we discuss the connection to randomized and Uhrig dynamical decoupling to develop more efficient implementations in the weak coupling regime.

Conclusion: The framework extends quantum mechanics to include a dual-manifold geometry, reproducing cosmological phenomena like dark energy and Hawking radiation without relying on general relativity.

Abstract: In conventional quantum mechanics, all unitary evolution takes place within the space-time Hilbert space $\mathcal H_{xt}=L^2(\mathcal M_{xt})$, with time as the sole evolution parameter. The momentum-energy representation $φ(k,E)$ is treated merely as a Fourier re-expression of the same state-kinematically equivalent but dynamically inert. Here we restore the fundamental symmetry between the conjugate pairs $(x,t)$ and $(k,E)$ by extending the quantum theory to an enlarged Hilbert space $\mathcal H_{\text{total}} = \mathcal H_{xt} \oplus \mathcal H_{kE}$, within which the momentum-energy sector $\mathcal H_{kE}=L^2(\mathcal M_{kE})$ carries its own autonomous unitary evolution generated by a self-adjoint operator $\hat{\mathcal T}$. The resulting structure establishes a meta-symmetry: a symmetry between two conjugate dynamical projections of a single global quantum state. It produces a dual-manifold geometry in which each domain is locally complete yet globally open, with divergent limits in one mapping onto extended regions in the other. Remarkably, the dual-manifold symmetry alone reproduces both the uniform dark-energy background and the exponential boundary mapping near black-hole horizons that underlies Hawking radiation. This framework thus opens a quantum-theoretic route to cosmological phenomena that are ordinarily treated within general relativity.

Abstract: The preparation and control of quantum states lie at the heart of quantum information science (QIS). Recent advances in solid-state quantum emitters (QEs) and nanophotonics have transformed the landscape of quantum photonic technologies, enabling scalable generation of quantum states of light and matter.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Breaking permutation symmetry with power law couplings shifts the system from chaotic to integrable, with thermalization at intermediate ranges influenced by driving period.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how breaking permutation symmetry with power law couplings affects collective quantum dynamics, particularly the emergence of new behaviors like thermalization.

Method: The research employs power law couplings (1/r^α) to break permutation symmetry, analyzing dynamical quantities like total angular momentum operator J^2 and von Neumann entropy S_{N/2}, alongside effective dimension and spectral statistics.

Result: For small α, the system remains close to the permutation-symmetric state. Intermediate α shows thermalization signatures, while large α approaches integrability. Larger driving periods extend the intermediate α range for thermalization.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the system's behavior transitions from a permutation-symmetric, chaotic state at α=0 to an integrable model at large α. Thermalization emerges at intermediate α values, influenced by the coupling range and driving period.

Abstract: Permutation symmetry plays a central role in the understanding of collective quantum dynamics. On the other hand, interactions are rarely uniform in real systems. By introducing power law couplings that algebraically decay with the distance between the spins $r$ as $1/r^α$, we break this symmetry with a non-zero $α$, and probe the emergence of new dynamical behaviors, including thermalization. As we increase $α$, the system interpolates from an infinite range spin system at $α=0$ exhibiting permutation symmetry, to a short range integrable model as $α\rightarrow \infty$ where this permutation symmetry is absent. We focus on the change in the behavior of the system as $α$ is tuned, using dynamical quantities like total angular momentum operator $J^2$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{N/2}$. Starting from the chaotic limit of the permutation symmetric Hamiltonian at $α=0$, we find that for small $α$, the steady state values of these quantities remain close to the permutation symmetric subspace values corresponding to $α=0$. At intermediate $α$ values, these show signatures of thermalization exhibiting values corresponding to that of random states in full Hilbert space. On the other hand, the large $α$ limit approaches the values corresponding to integrable kicked Ising model. In addition, we also study the dependence of thermalization on the driving period $τ$, with results indicating the onset of thermalization for smaller values of $α$ when $τ$ is large, thereby extending the intermediate range of $α$. We further confirm these results using effective dimension and spectral statistics.

Motivation: The work aims to explore the thermodynamic behavior of quantum systems in noncommutative geometry, particularly under the influence of non-extensive statistical mechanics, to uncover new physical phenomena.

Method: The authors analyze a quantum system in a two-dimensional noncommutative space, using Tsallis statistics to derive q-generalized versions of thermodynamic quantities like the partition function, magnetization, and magnetic susceptibility, via a generalized Hilhorst transformation.

Result: The findings demonstrate modified phase space structure due to minimal length, and the interplay between non-extensive parameter q and noncommutativity parameter θ leads to novel thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties.

Conclusion: The study reveals new thermodynamic regimes and anomalous electromagnetic properties in quantum systems within non-commutative geometry, highlighting the combined effects of non-extensivity and noncommutativity.

Abstract: This work investigates a quantum system described by a Hamiltonian operator in a two dimensional noncommutative space. The system consists of an electron subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, coupled to a harmonic potential and an external electric field $\mathbf{E}$, within the context of non-extensive statistical thermodynamics. The noncommutative geometry introduces a fundamental minimal length that modifies the phase space structure. The thermodynamics of this quantum system is developed within the framework of Tsallis statistics through the derivation of $q$-generalized versions of the partition function, magnetization, and magnetic susceptibility, following the application of a generalized Hilhorst transformation adapted to non-commutative geometry. The combined effects of the non-extensivity parameter $q$ and the noncommutativity parameter $θ$ are analyzed by considering the limit $q \rightarrow 1$, revealing new thermodynamic regimes and anomalous electromagnetic properties specific to quantum systems in non-commutative geometry.

Abstract: Active matter denotes a system of particles immersed in an external environment, from which the particles extract energy continuously in order to perform motion. Extending the paradigm of active matter to a quantum framework requires an open quantum system description. In this work, we consider a driven quantum particle whose external driving exhibits characteristics of classical activity. We model the dynamics with time-local master equations and analyze the particle motion at different time scales for different forms of the master equations. By systematically comparing several types of master equations, we uncover how the particle motion evolves under the interplay of quantum effects and active-like dynamics. These results are essential for guiding possible experiments aimed at realizing quantum analogues of classical active systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of kernel selection in small datasets by enhancing the MMD-FUSE framework with quantum kernels, aiming to improve test power and robustness in statistical testing.

Method: The study incorporates quantum kernels into the MMD-FUSE framework and proposes a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels, leveraging their respective strengths for improved performance.

Result: MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels outperforms classical counterparts in test power for small and high-dimensional data, while the hybrid framework adapts well to diverse data scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed MMD-FUSE framework, enhanced with quantum and hybrid kernels, demonstrates superior test power and robustness, particularly for small and high-dimensional datasets, highlighting its potential as a versatile tool in data analysis.

Abstract: Two-sample tests have been extensively employed in various scientific fields and machine learning such as evaluation on the effectiveness of drugs and A/B testing on different marketing strategies to discriminate whether two sets of samples come from the same distribution or not. Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired and hybrid kernel strategies to build more effective statistical tests, offering a versatile tool for data analysis where sample sizes are limited.

Result: The protocol functions as an integrated two-photon subtractor and a non-Gaussianity amplifier, producing high-fidelity squeezed Schrödinger cat states and high-purity approximations of key quantum resources.

Conclusion: This work transforms the optical parametric amplifier (OPA) from a specialized source into a versatile and practical platform for advanced quantum state engineering, enabling the generation of a wide array of non-Gaussian states from a single, integrated setup.

Abstract: The heralded optical parametric amplifier (OPA) has emerged as a promising tool for quantum state engineering. However, its potential has been limited to coherent state inputs. Here, we introduce a generalized heralded OPA protocol that unlocks a vastly expanded class of quantum phenomena by accepting arbitrary non-classical inputs. With a squeezed vacuum input, the setup functions as an integrated two-photon subtractor, deterministically generating high-fidelity, larger-amplitude squeezed Schrödinger cat states -- an operation previously requiring complex, discrete setups. Furthermore, when fed a small-amplitude SC state, the protocol acts as a non-Gaussianity amplifier, distilling it into high-purity approximations of key quantum resources like specific photon-number superpositions. This work transforms the OPA from a specialized source into a versatile and practical platform for advanced quantum state engineering, enabling the generation of a wide array of non-Gaussian states from a single, integrated setup.

Conclusion: The study identifies conditions for achieving algorithmic break-even with near-term quantum hardware and paves the way for an end-to-end compiler for early-fault-tolerant surface code architectures.

Abstract: Recent experimental progress in realizing surface code on hardware, including demonstrations of break-even logical memory on devices with up to hundreds of physical qubits, has materially advanced the prospects for fault-tolerant quantum computation. This progress creates urgency for the development of compilation workflows that directly target the forthcoming generation of devices with thousands of physical qubits, for which algorithm execution becomes practical. We develop a pipeline for compiling logical algorithms to physical circuits implementing lattice surgery on the surface code, and use this pipeline to identify the requirements for achieving algorithmic break-even -- where quantum error correction improves the performance of a quantum algorithm -- for two prominent quantum algorithms: the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Our pipeline integrates several open-source software tools, and leverages recent advances in error-aware unitary gate synthesis, high-fidelity magic state production, and the calculation of correlation surfaces in the surface code. We perform classical simulations of physical Clifford proxy circuits produced by our pipeline, and find that both 5-qubit QAOA and QPE can reach algorithmic break-even with 2517 physical qubits (surface code distance $d=11$) at physical error rates of $p=10^{-3}$, or 1737 physical qubits ($d=9$) at $p=5\times 10^{-4}$. Our work thereby identifies conditions for achieving algorithmic break-even with near-term quantum hardware and paves the way towards an end-to-end compiler for early-fault-tolerant surface code architectures.

TL;DR: MSD introduces a method to significantly reduce sampling costs in quantum Krylov algorithms for ground-state energy estimation, achieving up to 10,000x efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high sampling cost in quantum Krylov algorithms for ground-state energy estimation, which is a bottleneck for practical applications.

Method: MSD uses a finite-difference formula to express the Hamiltonian as linear combinations of time-evolution unitaries, optimizing timestep parameters and shifting the energy spectrum to minimize errors.

Result: MSD reduces sampling costs by 10 to 10,000 times compared to conventional methods, particularly effective when the Hamiltonian's spectral norm is much smaller than its 1-norm.

Conclusion: MSD achieves a significant reduction in sampling cost, offering a more efficient approach for quantum Krylov algorithms, especially in large-scale electronic structure problems.

Abstract: Quantum Krylov algorithms have emerged as a promising approach for ground-state energy estimation in the near-term quantum computing era. A major challenge, however, lies in their inherently substantial sampling cost, primarily due to the individual measurement of each term in the Hamiltonian. While various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, the sampling overhead remains a significant bottleneck, especially for practical large-scale electronic structure problems. In this work, we introduce an alternative method, dubbed mirror subspace diagonalization (MSD), which approaches the theoretical lower bound of the sampling cost for quantum Krylov algorithms. MSD leverages a finite-difference formula to express the Hamiltonian operator as a linear combination of time-evolution unitaries with symmetrically shifted timesteps, enabling efficient estimation of the Hamiltonian matrix within the Krylov subspace. In this scheme, the finite difference and statistical errors are simultaneously minimized by optimizing the timestep parameter and shifting the energy spectrum. Consequently, MSD attains the lower bound of the sampling cost of the quantum Krylov algorithms up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, we employ classical post-processing to infer Hamiltonian moments, which are used to mitigate the ground state energy error based on the Lanczos scheme. Through theoretical analysis of the sampling cost, we demonstrate that MSD is particularly effective when the spectral norm of the Hamiltonian is significantly smaller than its 1-norm. Such a situation arises, for example, in high-accuracy simulations of molecules using large basis sets that incorporate strong electronic correlations. Numerical results for various molecular models reveal that MSD can achieve sampling cost reductions ranging from approximately 10 to 10,000 times compared to the conventional quantum Krylov algorithm.

TL;DR: A method is proposed to generate robust multi-path entanglement in optomechanical systems by controlling polarization and dark modes, showing promise for quantum technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new avenues for generating resilient quantum entanglement using optomechanical systems, which could be beneficial for quantum technologies.

Method: The method involves using polarized electromagnetic fields and dark mode control in an optomechanical system with two mechanically coupled resonators. The polarization angle and phonon hopping rate are manipulated to break dark modes and generate multi-path entanglements.

Result: The scheme successfully generates bipartite and tripartite entangled states, which are highly resilient to thermal fluctuations (up to two orders of magnitude more robust in the DMB regime). Twin entangled states are also achieved at a specific polarization angle.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme paves the way for generating noise-tolerant quantum resources, with potential applications in quantum information processing, communication, and computational tasks.

Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate multi-paths entanglement in an optomechanical system by exploiting polarized electromagnetic fields and dark mode control. Our system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, which are driven by a common electromagnetic field. An inclusion of a polarizer induces linear polarizations of the electromgnetic field corresponding to the vertical (transverse electric ($\rm{TE}$) and horizontal (transverse magnetic [($\rm{TM}$]) modes, which drive the mechanical resonators. Without the mechanical coupling $J_m=0$, the polarization angle ($φ$) controls dark mode in the system. The breaking of this dark mode leads to multi-paths engineering of bipartite optomechanical entanglements. By switching on the phonon hopping rate ($J_m\neq0$), both the polarization angle and the modulation phase of the mechanical coupling allow a further control of the dark mode. The simultaneous Dark Mode Breaking (\rm{DMB}) conditions under these two parameters leads to multi-paths bipartite and tripartite entanglements. For a fine tuning of the polarization angle ($φ=π/4$) this scheme enables a generation of twin entangled states, where the bipartite/tripartite generated entangled states are degenerated and might be of great interest for quantum information processing, quantum communication and diverse quantum computational tasks. The generated entanglements are more resilient against thermal fluctuations in the \rm{DMB} regime, i.e., up to two order of magnitude robust than in the Unbreaking regime. Our work sheets light on new possibilities to generate noise-tolerant quantum resources that are useful for plethora of modern quantum technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze quantum teleportation in higher dimensions by jointly considering average fidelity and fidelity deviation, providing a diagnostic map and insights into resource properties.

Method: Representation-theoretical framework based on Schur-Weyl duality and permutation symmetry calculus, reducing higher-moment Haar averages to trace invariants of correction unitaries.

Result: Closed-form expressions for average fidelity and fidelity deviation, tight bounds linking these metrics, and diagnostic lines for teleportation advantage and Bell nonlocality.

Conclusion: The framework provides a unified analysis of quantum teleportation, linking average fidelity and fidelity deviation through a representation-theoretical approach. It also offers diagnostic tools and reveals insights into the distinction between entangled yet local and genuinely nonlocal resources.

Abstract: We develop a unified framework to analyze $d$-dimensional quantum teleportation through the joint geometry of two complementary figures of merit: average fidelity $F$ (how well a protocol works on average) and fidelity deviation $D$ (how uniformly it works across the inputs). Technically, we formulate a representation-theoretical framework based on Schur-Weyl duality and permutation symmetry calculus that reduce the higher-moment Haar averages to a finite set of trace invariants of the composed correction unitaries. This yields closed-form expressions for $F$ and $D$ in arbitrary Hilbert-space dimension and delivers tight bounds that link the admissible deviation directly to the gap from the optimal average performance. In particular, any measured pair $(F, D)$ can be ported into a visibility estimate for isotropic channel resources, turning the $(F, D)$-plane into a calibrated diagnostic map. We further cast the teleportation advantage and CGLMP-inequality violation as two witnesses lines in the $(F,D)$ plane: one line certifies that $F$ beats the classical benchmark $2/(d{+}1)$, while the other line certifies the Bell nonlocality. Their identical slope but distinct intercepts expose a quantitative gap between "entangled yet local" and "genuinely nonlocal" resources.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atom-like defects in hBN offer room-temperature single-photon emission and coherent spin states, but their random spatial and spectral characteristics limit deterministic coupling with nano-optical cavities.

Method: Tip-enhanced quantum-sensing spectroscopy was used to spatially position individual emitters within tip-cavities with different plasmon resonances, enabling adaptive control of enhancement rates and single-photon purity. ODMR experiments were conducted for spin defects.

Result: The approach demonstrated optimal reconfiguration of solid-state single-photon sources and enabled highly-sensitive quantum-sensing with room-temperature single-photon emitters.

Conclusion: The study provides a unique pathway toward highly-sensitive and deterministic quantum-sensing with room-temperature single-photon emitters in hBN.

Abstract: Atom-like defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide room-temperature single-photon emission and coherent spin states, making them attractive for quantum-computing and -sensing applications. However, their random spatial and spectral characteristics hamper deterministic coupling with nano-optical cavities, limiting their use as bright single-photon sources and sensitive quantum sensors. Here, we present tip-enhanced quantum-sensing spectroscopy of single-photon emitters in hBN. Through precise spatial positioning of individual emitters within tip-cavities with different plasmon resonances, we adaptively control the enhancement rates of both excitation and emission, as well as the single-photon purity. In this way, optimal selection of their relative contributions can effectively reconfigure solid-state single-photon sources, with simultaneous nano-spectroscopic space- and time-resolved analyses. Furthermore, we demonstrate tip-enhanced quantum-sensing with single spin defects through optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) experiments in tip-coupled hBN nanoflakes. Our approach provides a unique pathway toward highly-sensitive and deterministic quantum-sensing with room-temperature single-photon emitters.

Result: Demonstrates that orbital angular momentum significantly amplifies the ZBW amplitude in relativistic vortex states.

Conclusion: Relativistic vortex states unify Gaussian and Bessel-Gaussian models, opening new possibilities for observing relativistic quantum dynamics in structured electron wave packets.

Abstract: Zitterbewegung (ZBW), the trembling motion predicted by the Dirac equation, has long remained unobservable in free electrons due to its sub-Compton scale. We elaborately construct a relativistic vortex electron wave packet as a coherent superposition of both positive- and negative-energy Dirac states and derive their space-time dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates that introducing orbital angular momentum provides a mechanism for amplifying the ZBW amplitude far beyond that of conventional Gaussian packets, while maintaining coherence. The resulting relativistic vortex states unify Gaussian and Bessel-Gaussian models within a single framework and opens new possibilities for observing relativistic quantum dynamics in structured electron wave packets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift focus from local entanglement quantification to understanding the global organization and geometry of entanglement across the entire manifold of pure states.

Method: The authors use the projective Hilbert space of pure states with the Fubini-Study metric to define a geometric entanglement entropy, treating entanglement as a macroscopic functional on this manifold.

Result: The framework is successfully applied to spin-1/2 systems and bipartite entanglement of spin systems, with explicit calculations for a two-qubit case and an extension to spin chains.

Conclusion: The developed geometric framework provides a novel way to quantify and understand the global structure of entanglement in pure bipartite states, extending beyond local characterizations.

Abstract: Entanglement for pure bipartite states is most commonly quantified in a state-by-state manner to each pure state of a bipartite system a scalar quantity, such as the von Neumann entropy of a reduced density matrix. This provides a precise local characterization of how entangled a given state is. At the same time, this local description naturally invites a set of complementary, more global questions about the structure of the space of pure states: How abundant are the states with a given amount of entanglement within the full state space? Do the manifolds of constant entanglement exhibit distinct geometric regimes? These questions shift the focus from assigning an entanglement value to a single state to understanding the global organization and geometry of entanglement across the entire manifold of pure states.
  In this work, we develop a geometric framework in which these questions become natural. We regard the projective Hilbert space of pure states, endowed with the Fubini-Study metric, as a Riemannian manifold and promote bipartite entanglement to a macroscopic functional on this manifold. Its level sets stratify the space of pure states into hypersurfaces of constant entanglement, and we define a geometric entanglement entropy as the log-volume of these hypersurfaces, weighted by the Fubini-Study gradient of entanglement. This quantity plays the role of a microcanonical entropy in entanglement space: it measures the degeneracy of a given entanglement value in the natural quantum geometry.
  The framework is illustrated first in the simplest case of a single spin-1/2 and then for bipartite entanglement of spin systems, including a two-qubit example where explicit calculations can be carried out, along with a sketch of the extension to spin chains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck of controlled time evolution in quantum simulation algorithms by reducing circuit depth and control overhead.

Method: A compression protocol for encoding the controlled time evolution operator of translationally invariant, local Hamiltonians into a quantum circuit.

Result: The protocol achieves a near-optimal scaling in circuit depth and reduces control overhead to an additive factor, enabling efficient quantum phase estimation with minimal CNOT gates and low ground state energy errors (below 1% on a 4x4 lattice).

Conclusion: The proposed compression protocol successfully reduces the control overhead and achieves near-optimal scaling, enabling efficient implementation of quantum simulation algorithms with significantly fewer CNOT gates and delivering accurate ground state energy estimates even under hardware noise.

Abstract: Many optimally scaling quantum simulation algorithms employ controlled time evolution of the Hamiltonian, which is typically the major bottleneck for their efficient implementation. This work establishes a compression protocol for encoding the controlled time evolution operator of translationally invariant, local Hamiltonians into a quantum circuit. It achieves a near-optimal scaling in circuit depth $\mathcal{O}(t \text{ polylog}(t N/ε))$, while reducing the control overhead from a multiplicative to an additive factor. We report that this compression protocol enables the implementation of Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation with as few as 414 CNOT gates for a frustrated quantum spin system on a 6x6 triangular lattice and delivers ground state energy errors below 1% (with $\pm$ 1.5% variation, calculated with a hardware noise aware pipeline) on a 4x4 triangular lattice using the noisy emulator of the Quantinuum H2 trapped ion device.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost of quantum error mitigation while maintaining accuracy in noisy quantum simulations and experiments.

Method: The technique uses a locality approximation on the M0 method, leveraging the structure of tiled Ansätze (e.g., tUPS, QNP) to reduce QPU costs exponentially.

Result: Validation on molecular ground state energy calculations (4-12 qubits) shows little to no loss in accuracy compared to M0, with promising experimental performance.

Conclusion: The tiled M0 technique offers a cost-effective solution for quantum error mitigation with minimal accuracy loss, demonstrating potential for near-term quantum applications.

Abstract: We introduce a cost-effective quantum error mitigation technique that builds on the recent Ansatz-based gate and readout error mitigation method (M0). The technique, tiled M0, leverages the unique structure of tiled Ansätze (e.g., tUPS, QNP, hardware-efficient circuits) to apply a locality approximation to M0 that results in an exponential reduction in the QPU cost of the noise characterization. We validate the technique for molecular ground state energy calculations with the tUPS Ansatz on LiH, molecular hydrogen, water, butadiene, and benzene ($4-12$ qubits), demonstrating little to no loss in accuracy compared to M0 in noisy simulations. We also show the performance of the technique in quantum experiments, highlighting its potential use in near-term applications.

Abstract: Fermi's golden rule which describes the transition rates between two electronic levels under external stimulations is used ubiquitously in different fields of physics. The original Fermi's golden rule was derived from perturbative time-dependent Schrödinger's equation without the direct contribution by decoherence effect. However, as a result of recent developments of quantum computing and ultra fast carrier dynamics, the decoherence becomes a prominent topic in fundamental research.Here, by using the non-adiabatic molecular dynamics which goes beyond the time-dependent Schrödinger's equation by introducing decoherence, we study the effect of decoherence on Fermi's golden rule for the fixed basis and the adiabatic basis, respectively. We find that when the decoherence time becomes short, there is a significant deviation from the Fermi's golden rule for both bases. By using monolayer $\mathrm{WS_2}$ as an example, we investigate the decoherence effect in the carrier transitions induced by the electron-phonon coupling with first-principle method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a finite-key analytical security proof for the decoy-state BB84 protocol with passive basis choice, which reduces the need for random number generators and optical modulators.

Method: Presented a simple analytical finite-key security proof for the decoy-state BB84 protocol with passive biased basis choice, yielding a closed-form secret-key rate formula.

Result: Numerical simulations indicate that the key rates of passive and active-measurement implementations are nearly identical.

Conclusion: The passive measurement in decoy-state BB84 QKD does not compromise key-generation efficiency, as numerically simulated results show similar key rates to active-measurement implementations.

Abstract: The decoy-state Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol is widely regarded as the de facto standard for practical implementations. On the receiver side, passive basis choice is attractive because it significantly reduces the need for random number generators and eliminates the need for optical modulators. Despite these advantages, a finite-key analytical security proof for the decoy-state BB84 protocol, where the basis is chosen passively with a biased probability, has been lacking. In this work, we present a simple analytical finite-key security proof for this setting, yielding a closed-form secret-key rate formula that can be directly evaluated using experimentally accessible parameters. Numerical simulations show that the key rates of passiveand active-measurement implementations are nearly identical, indicating that passive measurement does not compromise key-generation efficiency in practical QKD systems.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a cornerstone of financial decision-making, traditionally relying on classical algorithms to balance risk and return. Recent advances in quantum computing offer a promising alternative, leveraging quantum algorithms to efficiently explore complex solution spaces and potentially outperform classical methods in high-dimensional settings. However, conventional quantum approaches typically assume a one-to-one correspondence between qubits and variables (e.g. financial assets), which severely limits the applicability of gate-based quantum systems due to current hardware constraints. As a result, only quantum annealing-like methods have been used in realistic scenarios. In this work, we show how a gate-based variational quantum algorithm can be applied to a real-world portfolio optimization problem by assigning multiple variables per qubit. Specifically, we address a problem involving over 250 variables, where the market graph representing a real stock market is iteratively partitioned into sub-portfolios of highly correlated assets. This approach enables improved scalability compared to traditional variational methods and opens new possibilities for quantum-enhanced financial applications.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Derives the generalized Born rule from basic principles and shows noise strengthens the scalar-probability link.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the generalized Born rule and the identification of scalars with probabilities can be derived from foundational principles rather than being postulated.

Method: The paper adopts a process-theoretic approach, starting with a naive interpretation of textbook quantum theory and extending it to show equivalence with theories where the generalized Born rule holds. Noise is introduced to observe its impact on the theory.

Result: Any process theory with the described structure is equivalent to one where the generalized Born rule holds. Introducing noise strengthens the scalar-probability identification to a semiring isomorphism.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the generalized Born rule can be derived from basic principles within a process-theoretic framework, and the introduction of noise further strengthens the identification between scalars and probabilities.

Abstract: A basic postulate of modern compositional approaches to generalised physical theories is the generalised Born rule, in which probabilities are postulated to be computable from the composition of states and effects. In this paper we consider whether this postulate, and the strength of the identification between scalars and probabilities, can be argued from basic principles. To this end, we first consider the most naive possible process-theoretic interpretation of textbook quantum theory, in which physical processes (unitaries) along with states and effects (kets and bras) and a probability function from states and effects satisfying just some basic compatibility axioms are identified. We then show that any process theory equipped with such structure is equivalent to an alternative process theory in which the generalised Born rule holds. We proceed to consider introduction of noise into any such theory, and observe that the result of doing so is a strengthening of the identification between scalars and probabilities; from bare monoid homomorphisms to semiring isomorphisms.

TL;DR: Two mechanisms for quantum entanglement in X-ray processes identified: spin-orbit vs. exchange interactions. No entanglement in 3d→3p due to crystal field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how quantum entanglement between photoelectron spin and X-ray photon polarization varies with excited core-level.

Method: Theoretical investigation using cluster and ionic models for Ti2O3-type and CeF3-type systems, analyzing spin- and polarization-resolved XEPECS processes.

Result: Two mechanisms identified: one from spin-orbit interaction of 2p core electron, another from spin-orbit and exchange interactions of 4f valence electron. No entanglement in 3d→3p case due to crystal field effect.

Conclusion: The study reveals two distinct mechanisms for quantum entanglement generation in X-ray inner-shell excitation processes, depending on the core-level and exchange interactions.

Abstract: We theoretically investigated how the quantum entanglement between the spin of the photoelectron and the polarization of the emitted X-ray photon depends on the excited core-level, using the 3$d\rightarrow\ $2$p$ and 3$d\rightarrow\ $3$p$ SPR-XEPECS (spin- and polarization-resolved XEPECS) processes for $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$-type system, and the 4$f\rightarrow\ $4$d$ SPR-XEPECS process for $\rm CeF_{3}$-type system. In the calculation for $\rm Ti_{2}O_{3}$-type system, we used $\rm TiO_{6}$ cluster model with the full-multiplet structure of the Ti ion and the charge-transfer effect between Ti 3$d$ and ligand O 2$p$ orbitals. For $\rm CeF_{3}$-type system, we used ionic model with the full-multiplet structure of the Ce ion. We found two distinct mechanisms for entanglement generation in the 3$d\rightarrow\ $2$p$ and 4$f\rightarrow\ $4$d$ cases. The first is generated by the spin-orbit interaction of the 2$p$ core electron, whereas the second is generated by the spin-orbit interaction of the 4$f$ valence electron and strong exchange interaction between the 4$f$ and 4$d$ electrons. However, in the 3$d\rightarrow\ $3$p$ case with the strong 3$d-$3$p$ exchange interaction, we found that the entanglement is not generated due to the crystal field effect. These results reveal the existence of two distinct mechanisms for entanglement generation in X-ray inner-shell excitation processes.

Motivation: To explore the quantum effects of gravity and investigate the relationship between quantum entanglement and transition rates in the QGEM experimental scheme.

Method: Analysis of the quantum properties of entangled final states generated in the Quantum Gravity Induced Entanglement of Masses (QGEM) scheme, focusing on the relationship between photon emission rates (transition rates) and the degree of entanglement.

Result: The transition rate decreases with increasing entanglement at small distances between particle pairs, then asymptotically approaches a value independent of entanglement as the distance increases.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of using photon emission rates to detect quantum entanglement in the QGEM scheme, as the transition rates exhibit a clear relationship with the degree of entanglement. This could provide a practical method for probing quantum gravity effects experimentally.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, as one of the fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics, has garnered significant attention over the past few decades for its extraordinary nonlocality. With the advancement of quantum technology, quantum entanglement holds promising application for exploring fundamental physical theories. The experimental scheme of Quantum Gravity Induced Entanglement of Masses (QGEM) was proposed to investigate the quantum effects of gravity based on the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) theory. In this study, we analyze the quantum properties of the entangled final states generated in the QGEM scheme. Our findings reveal that the photon emission rates (transition rates) are closely related to the degree of entanglement. Specifically, the transition rate decreases as the degree of entanglement increases when the distance between particle pairs is small, then it gradually approaches an asymptotic value that is independent of entanglement as the distance increases. We then discuss the possibility of using photon emission rates to detect quantum entanglement with these results.

Result: The system's evolution reveals a universal tendency towards the formation of the neutral hydrogen molecule across all configurations, with dissipation strengths and particle influx identified as critical control parameters.

Conclusion: This study establishes a unified theoretical foundation for quantum-controlled chemistry, with direct implications for future experiments in cavity QED and quantum information processing.

Abstract: The ionization dynamics of a hydrogen molecule, serving as a fundamental benchmark in quantum chemistry, is investigated within a comprehensive framework combining quantum electrodynamics and the Lindblad master equation. This approach enables a first-principles description of light--matter interactions while accounting for dissipative processes and external particle influx. We systematically explore the system's evolution across three distinct regimes: closed, dissipative open, and influx-driven open quantum systems. Our results reveal a universal tendency towards the formation of the neutral hydrogen molecule ($|\rm{H}_2\rangle$) across all configurations. The dissipation strengths for photons ($γ_Ω$), electrons ($γ_e$), and phonons ($γ_ω$) are identified as critical control parameters, with $γ_Ω$ significantly accelerating system stabilization. Furthermore, the introduction of particle influx ($μ_k$) leads to a complex redistribution of energy, notably populating the atomic state ($|\rm{H},\rm{H}\rangle$). The ionization pathway is exquisitely sensitive to the initial quantum state, dictated by the composition and number of photons, which governs the accessible spin-selective excitation channels. This is conclusively demonstrated in a model with an embedded anode, where the maximum ionization probability is fundamentally constrained to $\frac{3}{4}$ by orbital hybridization. This study provides a unified theoretical foundation for quantum-controlled chemistry, with direct implications for future experiments in cavity QED and quantum information processing.

Abstract: The question about the existence of so-called ``hidden'' variables in quantum mechanics and the perception of the completeness of quantum mechanics are two sides of the same coin. Quantum analytical mechanics constitutes a completion of standard quantum mechanics based on the concept of stochastic trajectories in the configuration space of a quantum system. For particle systems, configuration space is made up out of their coordinates and, if relevant, their orientation. Quantum analytical mechanics derives equations of motion for these variables which allow a description of the measurement process as a dynamical physical process. After all, it is exactly these variables experiments are designed to interact with. The theory is not a replacement of Hilbert space quantum mechanics but a mathematical completion enriching our toolset for the description of quantum phenomena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonstabilizerness (quantum magic) is a valuable resource in quantum error correction and computation, but the lack of physical observables quantifying magic hinders its direct microscopic or hydrodynamic description. This work aims to address this gap by studying the dynamics of locally injected magic in unitary Clifford circuits.

Method: The researchers used insights from stabilizer quantum error correcting codes to develop a canonical representation of low-magic states (bipartite magic gauge). They also proposed and numerically validated two magic length scales to study the dynamics of magic in unitary Clifford circuits.

Result: The spatial distribution of magic can be inferred from the bipartite magic gauge. Two magic length scales were identified, showing ballistic growth at early times with velocities set by the entanglement velocity, followed by delocalization of magic.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates how the spatial distribution of magic can be inferred using the bipartite magic gauge and identifies two operationally relevant magic length scales. It highlights the ballistic growth of these scales at early times and their connection to entanglement, providing insights into the spatiotemporal structure of quantum resources.

Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or quantum magic, presents a valuable resource in quantum error correction and computation. We study the dynamics of locally injected magic in unitary Clifford circuits, where the total magic is conserved. However, the absence of physical observables quantifying magic precludes a direct microscopic or hydrodynamic description of its local distribution and dynamics. Using insights from stabilizer quantum error correcting codes, we rigorously show that the spatial distribution of magic can be inferred from a canonical representation of low-magic states, dubbed the bipartite magic gauge. Moreover, we propose two operationally relevant magic length scales. We numerically establish that, at early times, both length scales grow ballistically at distinct velocities set by the entanglement velocity, after which magic delocalizes. Our work sheds light on the spatiotemporal structure of quantum resources and complexity in many-body dynamics, opening up avenues for investigating their transport properties and further connections with quantum error correction.

Abstract: We develop the theory describing the quantum coupled dynamics of the center-of-mass motion of a nanoparticle and an ensemble of ions co-trapped in a dual-frequency linear Paul trap. We first derive analytical expressions for the motional frequencies and classical trajectories of both nanoparticle and ions. We then derive a quantum master equation for the ion-nanoparticle system and quantify the sympathetic cooling of the nanoparticle motion enabled by its Coulomb coupling to a continuously Doppler-cooled ion. We predict that motional cooling down to sub-kelvin temperatures is achievable in state-of-the-art experiments even in the absence of motional feedback and in the presence of micromotion. We then extend our analysis to an ensemble of $N$ ions, predicting a linear increase of the cooling rate as a function of $N$ and motional cooling of the nanoparticle down to tenths of millikelvin in current experimental platforms. Our work establishes the theoretical toolbox needed to explore the ion-assisted preparation of non-Gaussian motional states of levitated nanoparticles.

Motivation: To understand the stability of the superradiant phase in the dissipative quantum Rabi model under weak spin relaxation and explore its dynamical processes.

Method: Mean-field and cumulant expansion analyses combined with exact numerical simulations were used to investigate the system. Finite-size scaling was employed to extrapolate results to the thermodynamic limit.

Result: Weak spin relaxation transforms the superradiant phase into a superradiant metastable phase with finite-lifetime symmetry-breaking states. The system dynamically restores symmetry in the steady state.

Conclusion: The study establishes the metastable nature of symmetry-breaking states in the dissipative quantum Rabi model and highlights the complexity of dissipative phase transitions compared to equilibrium phase transitions. The findings are relevant to a broad class of open quantum systems.

Abstract: The dissipative quantum Rabi model exhibits rich non-equilibrium physics, including a dissipative phase transition from the normal phase to the superradiant phase. In this work, we investigate the stability of the superradiant phase in the presence of a weak spin relaxation. We find that even a weak spin relaxation can render the superradiant phase to a superradiant metastable phase, in which symmetry-breaking states are stable only for a finite time. This arises because each spin-jump induced by relaxation applies as a strong perturbation to the system, potentially driving the system from a symmetry-breaking state to the symmetry-preserving saddle point with finite probability, before it eventually relaxes back to a symmetry-breaking state. Such dynamical processes lead to a finite lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states and restore the symmetry in the steady state. To substantiate these results, we combine mean-field and cumulant expansion analyses with exact numerical simulations. The lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states are analyzed in finite-size systems, and the conclusions are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit via finite-size scaling. Our findings establish the metastable nature of the symmetry-breaking states in the dissipative quantum Rabi model and reveal the complexity of the dissipative phase transition beyond their equilibrium counterpart. The mechanisms uncovered here can be generalized to a broad class of open quantum systems, highlighting fundamental distinctions between equilibrium phase transitions and steady-state phase transitions.

TL;DR: A hidden U(1) gauge interaction selectively activates for quantum coherence in massive systems, with unique signatures detectable via interferometry and entanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore a hidden U(1) gauge interaction that selectively couples to quantum coherence in massive systems, distinguishing classical and quantum regimes.

Method: The method involves constructing a conserved coherence current operator from the Noether mass current via operator-level coarse-graining. This current enables a hidden U(1) gauge interaction that activates only in the presence of quantum coherence.

Result: The framework predicts three distinctive signatures: (i) interferometric phase shifts, (ii) decoherence rates with unique scaling, and (iii) entanglement-selective forces. It also demonstrates how current experiments can constrain this interaction.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel theoretical framework for probing coherence-selective fundamental interactions, with potential implications for the quantum-classical transition. It also outlines experimental constraints achievable with current atom interferometers and levitated nanoparticles.

Abstract: We propose a hidden U(1) gauge interaction that couples exclusively to quantum coherence in massive systems. The central innovation is a conserved coherence current operator constructed from the Noether mass current via operator-level coarse-graining. This current vanishes for classical matter distributions but is nonzero for spatial superpositions and entangled states, yielding a gauge interaction that is dormant in classical regimes but activated by quantum coherence. The framework predicts three distinctive signatures: (i) interferometric phase shifts scaling linearly with fringe visibility, (ii) decoherence rates with characteristic m^2 scaling and spatial dependence distinct from collapse models, and (iii) entanglement-selective forces between distant massive qubits. The theory maintains full gauge invariance, causality, and positive time evolution. We show that state-of-the-art atom interferometers and levitated nanoparticles can place first constraints on this interaction class, complementary to classical fifth-force searches. This approach provides a novel theoretical framework for probing coherence-selective fundamental interactions and their potential role in the quantum-classical transition. To make this more concrete, we also spell out a simple benchmark latent-field model and work out, in detail, how a representative large-momentum-transfer atom interferometer constrains the corresponding coupling strength.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the structural organization of complex systems by quantifying fluctuations and correlations across scales, especially in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions.

Method: Revisiting the theoretical foundations of correlation functions in second-order phase transitions, extending the Ising model to non-integer spatial dimensions, and deriving a geometrical relation between fractal dimensions.

Result: A fractal dimension governing correlations is identified, distinct from the order parameter's fractal dimension, and an explicit geometrical relation connects them. The Rushbrooke scaling relation holds for continuous spatial dimensions.

Conclusion: The analysis confirms the universality of critical scaling and highlights the role of fractal geometry in characterizing correlations at criticality, even in non-integer spatial dimensions.

Abstract: Understanding phase transitions requires not only identifying order parameters but also characterizing how their correlations behave across scales. By quantifying how fluctuations at distinct spatial or temporal points are related, correlation functions reveal the structural organization of complex systems. Here, we revisit the theoretical foundations of these correlations in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions, with emphasis on the Ising model extended to non-integer spatial dimensions. Starting from the classical framework introduced by Fisher, we discuss how the standard Euclidean treatment, restricted to integer dimensions, necessitates the introduction of the critical exponent $η$ to capture the spatial decay of correlations at $T=T_c$. We suppose that, at criticality, the equilibrium dynamics become effectively confined to the fractal edge of spin clusters. Within this framework, the fractal dimension that governs the correlations in that subspace is directly related to Fisher exponent, which quantifies the singular behavior of the correlation function near criticality. Importantly, this correlation fractal dimension is distinct from the fractal dimension associated with the order parameter. We further derive an explicit geometrical relation connecting the two fractal dimensions, thereby linking spatial self-similarity to the observed scaling behavior at criticality. This treatment naturally extends to non-integer spatial dimensions, which remain valid below the upper critical dimension and produce the correct value of Fisher exponent $η$ for a continuous space dimension. Our analysis also confirms that the Rushbrooke scaling relation, continues to hold when the spatial dimension is treated as a continuous parameter, reinforcing the universality of critical scaling and underscoring the role of fractal geometry in characterizing correlations at criticality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of traditional Monte Carlo methods and fully-connected bipartite RBMs in simulating geometrically frustrated systems with sparse interactions.

Method: The paper employs Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) to leverage translational symmetry in lattices and a digital hardware accelerator to enhance sampling performance.

Result: The approach successfully simulates lattices with up to 324 spins, recovering all known phases of the Shastry-Sutherland Ising model, and achieves a 3 to 10^5 speedup over GPU-based implementations.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the successful implementation of Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) and digital hardware accelerators for simulating geometrically frustrated systems, achieving significant speedups and scalability.

Abstract: Geometric frustration gives rise to emergent quantum phenomena and exotic phases of matter. While Monte Carlo methods are traditionally used to simulate such systems, their sampling efficiency is limited by the complexity of interactions and ground-state properties. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), a class of probabilistic neural networks, offer improved sampling by incorporating machine learning techniques. However, fully-connected bipartite RBMs are inefficient for representing physical lattices with sparse interactions. To address this, we implement Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) that leverage translational symmetry inherent to lattices. Using the classical Shastry-Sutherland (SS) Ising lattice, we demonstrate (i) CRBM formulation that captures SS interactions, and (ii) digital hardware accelerator to enhance sampling performance. We simulate lattices with up to 324 spins, recovering all known phases of the SS Ising model, including the long range ordered fractional plateau. Our hardware characterizes spin behavior at critical points and within spin liquid phases. This implementation achieves a speedup of 3 to 5 orders of magnitude (33 ns to 120 ms) over GPU-based implementations. Moreover, the time-to-solution is within two orders of magnitude of quantum annealers, while offering superior scalability, room-temperature operation and reprogrammability. This work paves a pathway for scalable digital hardware that embeds physical symmetries to enable large scale simulations of material systems.

Conclusion: The study confirms the existence of a Lifshitz fixed point with a non-classical anisotropy exponent θ < 1/2 and provides critical exponent estimates for the 3D uniaxial Lifshitz point, aligning with other theoretical methods.

Abstract: We employ the derivative expansion of the nonperturbative renormalization group to address the phenomenon of anisotropic scale invariance and the associated functional fixed points, also known as Lifshitz points, in systems characterized by a scalar order parameter. We demonstrate the existence of the Lifshitz fixed point featuring a non-classical value of the anisotropy exponent $θ<1/2$ and provide estimates for values of a set of critical exponents in the physically most relevant case of the three-dimensional uniaxial Lifshitz point $(d,m)=(3,1)$, $m$ denoting the anisotropy index. We compare our predictions with existing estimates from perturbative expansions around dimensionality $d=4+\frac{1}{2}$ as well as those from the $1/N$ expansion.

*Radu A. Talmazan,Christophe Chipot*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: A new computational workflow (PCCANN-MACE) for dynamic chemical reaction analysis reveals lower barriers and new pathways, validated against DFT benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for dynamic effects in understanding chemical reaction pathways by introducing a novel computational workflow.

Method: A committor-based workflow integrating PCCANN with an iteratively trained hybrid-DFT-level MACE potential is introduced. The method starts with a static nudged elastic band path and extracts a committor-consistent string.

Result: The method reveals lower barriers than static treatments in an SNAr reaction and uncovers competing channels and metastable intermediates in protonated isobutanol isomerization. Results closely match high-level DFT benchmarks.

Conclusion: The PCCANN-MACE protocol is validated as an accurate and powerful approach for discovering complex reaction dynamics, revealing mechanistic diversity and previously unknown intermediates in chemical reactions.

Abstract: As computational chemistry methods evolve, dynamic effects have been increasingly recognized to govern chemical reaction pathways in both organic and inorganic systems. Here, we introduce a committor-based workflow that integrates a path-committor-consistent artificial neural network (PCCANN) with an iteratively trained hybrid-DFT-level message passing atomic convolutional encoder (MACE) potential. Beginning with a static nudged elastic band path, PCCANN extracts a committor-consistent string to represent the reactive ensemble. We illustrate the power of this methodology through two representative applications. First, we investigate an SNAr reaction using MACE trained at hybrid DFT level with implicit solvent. The mechanism is found to be concerted, and the dynamic approach reveals a lower barrier than static treatments. Second, we apply the same protocol to the isomerization of protonated isobutanol to protonated 2-butanol, yielding a quantitatively accurate free-energy landscape. We uncover three competing channels: the established concerted mechanism and two asynchronous stepwise routes mediated by water and methyl transfer, all with comparable activation barriers. Notably, the stepwise pathways traverse metastable intermediates that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been described in prior mechanistic studies. Calculated barrier heights and intermediate stabilities are in close agreement with high-level DFT benchmarks, demonstrating the framework's accuracy. Together, these studies highlight mechanistic diversity across distinct systems and establish the synergistic PCCANN-MACE protocol as a proof-of-concept approach for committor-based discovery of complex reaction dynamics.

### [65] [Dynamics of a tracer trapped in a correlated medium in the presence of a wall](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21436)
*Marcin Piotr Pruszczyk,Andrea Gambassi*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Study of particle near a wall in a fluctuating medium shows repulsive force, renormalized trap strength, and memory-dependent dynamics with algebraic decay at criticality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand the impact of a thermally fluctuating medium and boundary conditions on the dynamics of a trapped particle near a wall, focusing on fluctuation-induced forces and memory effects.

Method: The paper models the medium as a Gaussian field with tunable correlation length and employs dissipative relaxational dynamics with Dirichlet boundary conditions to analyze the particle's motion.

Result: The results show a repulsive fluctuation-induced force altering the particle's average position and trap strength, with a nonlinear memory term in its dynamics. The correlation function exhibits a memory-induced term with algebraic decay at criticality.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the particle's dynamics near a wall are significantly influenced by the fluctuation-induced force, leading to a renormalized trap strength and a memory-dependent correlation function.

Abstract: We describe the random motion of a particle immersed in a thermally fluctuating medium and harmonically trapped at a certain distance from a wall. The medium, modeled by a Gaussian field with a tunable correlation length $ξ$, is linearly coupled to the particle and evolves according to dissipative relaxational dynamics. Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed on the field at the wall give rise to a repulsive fluctuation-induced force acting on the particle, causing a shift in its average position and a renormalization of the strength of the harmonic trap. We describe the effective overdamped dynamics of the particle, which features a nonlinear memory term depending on the wall-particle separation. We show that the two-time correlation function of the particle position features a memory-induced term that depends on the distance of the particle from the wall. At the critical point, this term decays algebraically upon increasing time and it displays a crossover from the behavior observed in the bulk to that corresponding to having the particle at the wall.

### [67] [Giant enhancement of transport driven by active fluctuations: impact of inertia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21536)
*K. Białas,J. Spiechowicz*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Inertia significantly impacts the enhancement of free Brownian particle transport driven by active fluctuations, with effects ranging from strengthening to destruction, dependent on parameter regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how inertia influences the paradoxical effect of enhanced transport in a Brownian particle driven by active fluctuations when subjected to a periodic potential.

Method: Comprehensive investigation of the impact of inertia on the free transport enhancement effect observed in overdamped systems, exploring different parameter regimes and scenarios.

Result: Inertia can induce, strengthen, weaken, or destroy the transport enhancement effect, with the variance of the active fluctuations amplitude distribution being a critical factor.

Conclusion: Inertia can induce, strengthen, weaken, or destroy the phenomenon of free transport enhancement in Brownian particles driven by active fluctuations, with the variance of the active fluctuations amplitude distribution playing a key role. These findings are relevant for both microscopic physical and biological systems.

Abstract: Recently, a paradoxical effect has been demonstrated in which transport of a free Brownian particle driven by active fluctuations in the form of white Poisson shot noise can be significantly enhanced when it is additionally subjected to a periodic potential. This phenomenon can emerge in an overdamped system, but it may also be inertia-induced. Here, we considerably extend previous studies and comprehensively investigate the impact of inertia on the effect of free transport enhancement observed in the overdamped system. We detect that inertia can not only induce this phenomenon, but depending on a parameter regime, it may also strengthen, weaken, or even destroy it. We exemplify these different scenarios and explore the parameter space to identify the corresponding regions where they emerge. The variance of the active fluctuations amplitude distribution is a key determinant of the inertia influence on the effect of free transport amplification. Our results are relevant not only for microscopic physical systems but also for biological ones, such as, e.g., living cells, where fluctuations generated by metabolic activities are active by default.
