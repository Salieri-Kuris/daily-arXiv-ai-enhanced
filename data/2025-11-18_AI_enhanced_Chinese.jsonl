Electrical transport has been the primary diagnostic tool for identifying superconductivity in these systems, whereas complementary probes, including magnetic, spectroscopic, tunnelling and ultrafast methods, remain mostly qualitative due to experimental constraints and sample heterogeneity. Recent concerns over their reliability have fuelled controversy, leading to scepticism and pointing out the need for alternative, quantitative approaches. In this study, we acquired unprecedented high-quality Raman spectra of hexagonal LaH10 at approximately 145 GPa and low temperatures, in conjunction with electrical transport measurements. Upon cooling, we observe a drop of resistivity and simultaneous remarkable variations of phonon frequencies and linewidths. These effects are interpreted and perfectly reproduced by the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, providing a definitive proof of phonon-mediated superconductivity and enabling a quantitative determination of the superconducting energy gap. Our results establish Raman spectroscopy as a robust, contact-free probe with micrometric resolution for studying high temperature superconductivity, opening a powerful route to its discovery and characterization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u54c1\u8d28\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u7535\u963b\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bc1\u660eLaH10\u7684\u58f0\u5b50\u4ecb\u5bfc\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u538b\u4e0b\u6c22\u5316\u7269\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7535\u963b\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u54c1\u8d28\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u5b9a\u91cf\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u8d85\u5bfc\u80fd\u9699", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6709\u5173\u6c22\u5316\u7269\u9ad8\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u4e89\u8bae"}}

The ground-state languages have exponential growth constants $\u03bb_K$ that decrease monotonically, starting from the value associated with the ``golden chain'' (approximately 1.618) and progressing toward 1.

Our results show that inter-qubit coupling and energy splitting epsilon significantly influence the dynamics, producing pronounced oscillations in the weak-coupling regime and protecting pre-existing entanglement in the strong-coupling regime. NG is the most sensitive, QD persists longer revealing nonclassical correlations independent of entanglement, and QM-EUR reflects residual quantum memory and entropic uncertainty, showing that quantum signatures survive even when NG and QD are weak. Pulse amplitude and width effectively control the generation and dissipation of correlations, while the intensity of pulse-induced dephasing modulates the balance between sustained oscillations and rapid decoherence. The initial state also plays a crucial role: a partially entangled initial state is more resilient to perturbations, preserving correlations over time, whereas a separable state exhibits cycles of entanglement creation and destruction. Thus, by adjusting system parameters, it is possible to control the stability and lifetime of correlations and coherence, providing a framework to optimize quantum systems for applications requiring both strong entanglement and long-lasting coherence, such as quantum computing and secure communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\uff08NG\u3001QD\u3001QM-EUR\uff09\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u8109\u51b2\u548c\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u901a\u9053\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5916\u52a0\u8109\u51b2\u548c\u5404\u79cd\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u901a\u9053\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5e45\u5ea6\u963b\u5c3c\u3001\u7eaf\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u8bf1\u5bfc\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dNG\u3001QD\u548cQM-EUR\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u88c2\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u533a\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u533a\u4fdd\u62a4\u9884\u5b58\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002\u8109\u51b2\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5173\u8054\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8017\u6563\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}
