### [1] [Limitations of Quantum Advantage in Unsupervised Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10709)
*Apoorva D. Patel*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子机器学习模型通过替换经典概率分布为量子密度矩阵，可能在某些数据和应用场景中展现优势，但受限于输入数据和目标观测量的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子机器学习模型在无监督学习中的潜在优势，尤其是在处理大数据时的表现。

Method: 将经典概率分布替换为量子密度矩阵，并利用其独特特征进行数据分析和预测。

Result: 讨论了量子优势的具体限制条件及其对数据分析和传感应用的影响。

Conclusion: 量子机器学习模型的应用优势取决于数据的性质和目标观测量的特性，且存在一定的限制条件。

Abstract: Machine learning models are used for pattern recognition analysis of big data, without direct human intervention. The task of unsupervised learning is to find the probability distribution that would best describe the available data, and then use it to make predictions for observables of interest. Classical models generally fit the data to Boltzmann distribution of Hamiltonians with a large number of tunable parameters. Quantum extensions of these models replace classical probability distributions with quantum density matrices. An advantage can be obtained only when features of density matrices that are absent in classical probability distributions are exploited. Such situations depend on the input data as well as the targeted observables. Explicit examples are discussed that bring out the constraints limiting possible quantum advantage. The problem-dependent extent of quantum advantage has implications for both data analysis and sensing applications.

### [2] [Universal Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation for Quantum $f-$Divergences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10817)
*Domingos S. P. Salazar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A universal χ²-mixture representation is derived for quantum f-divergences, enabling a tight thermodynamic uncertainty relation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to unify the understanding of quantum f-divergences by identifying χ²_λ as fundamental building blocks and to derive a universal lower bound for f-divergences in quantum thermodynamics.

Method: The method involves using the Stieltjes representation of the generator f to derive nonnegative weights w_f(λ) for the χ²-mixture representation. It also leverages the Chapman-Robbins variational representation for classical Pearson χ² divergences.

Result: The paper shows that any Petz f-divergence can be expressed as a positive superposition of quadratic contrasts χ²_λ with explicit weights w_f(λ). It also provides a tight quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation based on these results.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a universal χ²-mixture representation for Petz f-divergences, linking them to classical Pearson χ² divergences and providing a tight quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation.

Abstract: We show that any Petz $f$-divergence (where $f$ is operator convex) between quantum states admits a universal $χ^2$-mixture representation: the distinguishability of $ρ$ from $σ$ is obtained as a positive superposition of quadratic contrasts $χ^2_λ$, with nonnegative weights $w_f(λ)$ determined explicitly from the Stieltjes representation of the generator $f$. This identifies $χ^2_λ$ as atomic building blocks for quantum $f$-divergences and yields closed-form $w_f$ for canonical choices (relative entropy/KL, Hellinger/Bures, R'{e}nyi). By mapping $χ^2_λ$ into a classical Pearson $χ^2$, we leverage the Chapman-Robbins variational representation and obtain a tight and universal quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation: any $f$-divergence is lower bounded by a function of the statistics of quantum observables (mean and variance), reproducing previous and novel results in quantum thermodynamics as applications.

### [3] [Entanglement boosting: Low-volume logical Bell pair preparation for distributed fault-tolerant quantum computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10729)
*Shinichi Sunami,Yutaka Hirano,Toshihide Hinokuma,Hayata Yamasaki*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes an entanglement boosting protocol for distributed FTQC, introducing LLV as a practical cost metric and achieving efficient high-fidelity Bell pair preparation with minimized local operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the limitations of existing entanglement distillation protocols, which focus on minimizing Bell pair consumption but ignore the spacetime volume of local operations, hindering practical distributed FTQC implementation.

Method: The method involves introducing a new metric, LLV, to characterize the practical cost of preparing logical Bell pairs. The protocol employs soft-information decoders and postselection to suppress logical error rates, leveraging a pipelined implementation of entanglement distillation.

Result: The results show the protocol achieves a reduction in LLV by orders of magnitude compared to prior methods, with logical error rates suppressed to practical levels (around 10^{-10}) using fewer than 100 noisy physical Bell pairs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed entanglement boosting protocol significantly reduces the link-limited volume (LLV) and prepares high-fidelity logical Bell pairs efficiently, paving the way for practical distributed fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC).

Abstract: Distributed architecture is a promising route to scaling fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) beyond the inherent limitations of single processors. For practical implementation of distributed FTQC, logical Bell pair preparation must be designed not only for efficient Bell pair consumption but also for the spacetime volume of the protocol; however, entanglement distillation protocols have primarily focused on minimizing the consumption of Bell pairs, often resulting in protocols that require a substantial number of local operations. To resolve this issue, we introduce a metric for characterizing the practical cost of preparing high-fidelity logical Bell pairs, link-limited volume (LLV), which is a circuit-volume metric incorporating both the cost of physical Bell pair consumption and the volume associated with local operations. Guided by this metric, we propose entanglement boosting protocol, which achieves efficient preparation of logical Bell pairs encoded in rotated surface code with LLV reduced by orders of magnitude compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. In this protocol, paralleling recent advances in magic state cultivation, we employ soft-information decoders and postselection to suppress the logical error rates of Bell pairs to practical levels in the order of $10^{-10}$ from fewer than 100 noisy physical Bell pairs while all local operations are implementable within a spatial region of a single surface code patch. We also present a pipelined implementation of entanglement distillation using high-rate quantum error-correcting codes, enabling arbitrarily low logical error rates while also maintaining physically efficient implementations. These results pave the way for the practical implementation of distributed FTQC, reinforcing the benefits of fast interconnect technologies and serving as a guiding principle for the efficient design of protocols and devices.

TL;DR: The paper studies how atmospheric turbulence affects entangled biphoton states, showing persistent spatial correlations and identifying optimal distances for angle-OAM entanglement in free-space quantum communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the influence of atmospheric turbulence on the propagation of entangled biphoton states is essential for free-space quantum communication protocols.

Method: Using the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle and the Kolmogorov turbulence model, the authors derive an analytical expression for the combined density operator of the signal and idler fields.

Result: The spatial correlations between signal and idler persist through turbulence despite the loss of state purity, transitioning from quantum to classical nature.

Conclusion: The study identifies a finite range of propagation distances over which angle-OAM entanglement is maximized, providing valuable insights for designing free-space quantum communication links.

Abstract: Understanding the influence of atmospheric turbulence on the propagation of entangled biphoton states is essential for free-space quantum communication protocols. Using the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle and the Kolmogorov turbulence model, we derive an analytical expression for the combined density operator of the signal and idler fields generated via SPDC, following propagation through separate turbulent channels. By expressing this density operator in the continuous position basis, we show how the spatial correlations between signal and idler persist through turbulence despite the loss of state purity, as they transition from being quantum to classical in nature. We further identify a finite range of propagation distances over which the angle-OAM entanglement is maximized, which provides valuable insights for designing free-space quantum communication links operating over several kilometers through the turbulent atmosphere.

### [5] [Understanding the Nature of Depth-1 Equivariant Quantum Circuit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10756)
*Jonathan Teo,Lee Xin Wei,Hoong Chuin Lau*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: SIGS optimizes QRL training, enabling efficient simulation of large TSP instances with minimal performance loss and reduced computation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the success of Equivariant Quantum Circuits (EQC) for small TSP problems, extending them to larger sizes faces challenges like exponential resource requirements and hardware noise, necessitating more efficient methods.

Method: The Size-Invariant Grid Search (SIGS) is introduced as an efficient training optimization for Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), enabling simulation of Depth-1 EQC outputs for TSP instances up to 350 nodes.

Result: SIGS reduces simulation time for 100-node TSP by 96.4%, achieving a mean optimality gap within 0.005 of the RL-trained model, and enables simulation up to 350 nodes.

Conclusion: The proposed SIGS method significantly reduces simulation times for larger TSP instances while maintaining near-optimal performance, providing a practical tool for the QRL community and extending the theoretical understanding of size-invariant properties.

Abstract: The Equivariant Quantum Circuit (EQC) for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been shown to achieve near-optimal performance in solving small TSP problems (up to 20 nodes) using only two parameters at depth 1. However, extending EQCs to larger TSP problem sizes remains challenging due to the exponential time and memory for quantum circuit simulation, as well as increasing noise and decoherence when running on actual quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Size-Invariant Grid Search (SIGS), an efficient training optimization for Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), and use it to simulate the outputs of a trained Depth-1 EQC up to 350-node TSP instances - well beyond previously tractable limits. At TSP with 100 nodes, we reduce total simulation times by 96.4%, when comparing to RL simulations with the analytical expression (151 minutes using RL to under 6 minutes using SIGS on TSP-100), while achieving a mean optimality gap within 0.005 of the RL trained model on the test set. SIGS provides a practical benchmarking tool for the QRL community, allowing us to efficiently analyze the performance of QRL algorithms on larger problem sizes. We provide a theoretical explanation for SIGS called the Size-Invariant Properties that goes beyond the concept of equivariance discussed in prior literature.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的方法来验证量子通道是否能保持纠缠维度高于给定阈值，方法具有普适性和可信性，且可扩展到其他非资源破坏通道的验证。

Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement offers significant advantages over low-dimensional ones in various information-processing tasks. However, to harness these advantages, it is crucial that the quantum channels used to store or transmit the subsystems of an entangled system not only preserve entanglement but also maintain its dimensionality above a certain threshold. The maximum entanglement dimension that a channel can preserve is referred to as its effective dimensionality, since the channel cannot be used to transmit information of dimension greater than that in a single use. In this work, we present a method to certify whether a quantum channel can preserve entanglement dimension above a given threshold. Unlike existing approaches, our method is faithful -- it can be applied to any channel, and avoids common assumptions such as reliable preparation of entangled states, auxiliary side channels, or perfect measurement devices. Moreover, the method can be extended to faithfully certify other classes of non-resource-breaking channels, such as non-NPT-breaking channels. Finally, we discuss possible experimental realizations of our certification scheme through explicit examples.

*Yuchen Wang,Irma Avdic,Michael Rose,Lillian I. Payne Torres,Anna O. Schouten,Kevin J. Sung,David A. Mazziotti*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A correlated purification framework using semidefinite programming restores accuracy to noisy quantum state RDMs by optimizing energy and error norms, achieving chemical accuracy in practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To restore accuracy to noisy, unphysical two-electron RDMs resulting from classical shadow tomography, which often violate $N$-representability conditions due to statistical and hardware noise.

Method: The framework utilizes semidefinite programming to perform a bi-objective optimization that minimizes both the many-electron energy and the nuclear norm of the change in the measured 2-RDM, promoting low-rank, physically meaningful corrections.

Result: Substantial reductions in both energy and 2-RDM error, achieving chemical accuracy across dissociation curves in fermionic shadow tomography of large hydrogen chains.

Conclusion: The correlated purification framework effectively addresses the issue of noisy and unphysical reduced density matrices (RDMs) in quantum states, offering a scalable and robust strategy for tomography in many-body quantum simulations. It achieves chemical accuracy in practical applications like hydrogen chains.

Abstract: Classical shadow tomography offers a scalable route to estimating properties of quantum states, but the resulting reduced density matrices (RDMs) often violate constraints that ensure they represent $N$-electron states -- known as $N$-representability conditions -- because of statistical and hardware noise. We present a correlated purification framework based on semidefinite programming to restore accuracy to these noisy, unphysical two-electron RDMs. The method performs a bi-objective optimization that minimizes both the many-electron energy and the nuclear norm of the change in the measured 2-RDM. The nuclear norm, often employed in matrix completion, promotes low-rank, physically meaningful corrections to the 2-RDM, while the energy term acts as a regularization term that can improve the purity of the ground state. While the method is particularly effective for the ground state, it can also be applied to excited and non-stationary states by decreasing the weight of the energy relative to the error norm. In an application to fermionic shadow tomography of large hydrogen chains, correlated purification yields substantial reductions in both energy and 2-RDM error, achieving chemical accuracy across dissociation curves. This framework provides a robust strategy for tomography in many-body quantum simulations.

Conclusion: 该论文通过建立或应用上界于Bures距离和对称对数导数费舍尔信息，为量子通道分辨和估计提供了概念简单且统一的证明框架，有助于解决该领域的未来问题。

Abstract: The goal of quantum channel discrimination and estimation is to determine the identity of an unknown channel from a discrete or continuous set, respectively. The query complexity of these tasks is equal to the minimum number of times one must call an unknown channel to identify it within a desired threshold on the error probability. In this paper, we establish lower bounds on the query complexities of channel discrimination and estimation, in both the parallel and adaptive access models. We do so by establishing new or applying known upper bounds on the squared Bures distance and symmetric logarithmic derivative Fisher information of channels. Phrasing our statements and proofs in terms of isometric extensions of quantum channels allows us to give conceptually simple proofs for both novel and known bounds. We also provide alternative proofs for several established results in an effort to present a consistent and unified framework for quantum channel discrimination and estimation, which we believe will be helpful in addressing future questions in the field.

We further show that if we allow for non-local gates, the Gibbs state of the periodic 1D Ising model can be prepared in logarithmic depth and linearly many simultaneous measurements.

TL;DR: New quantum secure time transfer system uses self-generated keys and hybrid architecture to robustly protect clock synchronization from attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address vulnerabilities in current synchronization techniques (e.g., intercept-resend attacks, spoofing, delay attacks) for quantum communication, sensing, and positioning.

Method: Proposed and experimentally demonstrated a QSTT system with self-generated quantum keys and an obfuscated encryption sequence within a hybrid architecture.

Result: The system information-theoretically secures the maximum amount of timing data and introduces a secure encryption sequence for remaining data.

Conclusion: Our new QSTT system, utilizing self-generated quantum keys and hybrid quantum/post-quantum architecture, represents the most robust implementation of quantum secure time transfer to date.

Abstract: High-precision clock synchronization is essential for a wide range of network-distributed applications. In the quantum space, these applications include communication, sensing, and positioning. However, current synchronization techniques are vulnerable to attacks, such as intercept-resend attacks, spoofing, and delay attacks. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new quantum secure time transfer (QSTT) system, subsequently used for clock synchronization, that largely negates such attacks. Novel to our system is the optimal use of self-generated quantum keys within the QSTT to information-theoretically secure the maximum amount of timing data; as well as the introduction, within a hybrid quantum/post-quantum architecture, of an information-theoretic secure obfuscated encryption sequence of the remaining timing data. With these enhancements, we argue that our new system represents the most robust implementation of QSTT to date.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the emergent phenomenon of spontaneous macroscopic quantum synchronization, where quantum oscillators achieve global phase coherence through interaction and dissipation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that an ensemble of TLS is a significant system for understanding spontaneous quantum synchronization, illustrating both full and partial synchronization scenarios.

Abstract: Spontaneous macroscopic quantum synchronization is an emergent phenomenon where an ensemble of quantum oscillators achieves global phase coherence through the interplay of interaction and dissipation. To illuminate this phenomenon, we study an ensemble of two-level systems (TLS) and establish its associated nonlinear quantum master equation, for which self-consistent analytical solutions of quantum synchronization can be obtained. The trajectories on the Bloch sphere vividly illustrate how dissipation and interaction drive the system toward a synchronized state. We present a phase diagram for macroscopic synchronization as a function of interaction strength and the gain-to-damping ratio. Furthermore, we demonstrate full synchronization and partial synchronization between two groups of TLS with different natural frequencies. This work establishes ensemble of TLS as a remarkable system for understanding spontaneous quantum synchronization.

TL;DR: MERA是一种MCM错误感知的编译框架，显著提升动态量子电路的保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编译器（如Qiskit和QR-Map）未考虑MCM操作中量子比特依赖的错误变异性，导致频繁MCM操作的电路保真度显著下降。

Method: MERA通过轻量级分析获取每个量子比特的MCM错误分布，并基于此进行错误感知的量子比特映射和SWAP插入。此外，MERA结合了上下文感知的动态解耦策略以减少MCM相关的退相干和串扰。

Result: 在27个基准电路上，MERA比Qiskit编译器（优化级别3）提高了24.94%至52.00%的保真度，且无额外开销。在QR-Map生成的电路上，平均提升29.26%，最佳情况下提升122.58%。

Conclusion: MERA显著提升了动态量子电路中MCM操作的保真度，验证了其在资源高效算法和错误校正中的有效性。

Abstract: Mid-circuit measurement (MCM) provides the capability for qubit reuse and dynamic control in quantum processors, enabling more resource-efficient algorithms and supporting error-correction procedures. However, MCM introduces several sources of error, including measurement-induced crosstalk, idling-qubit decoherence, and reset infidelity, and these errors exhibit pronounced qubit-dependent variability within a single device. Since existing compilers such as the Qiskit-compiler and QR-Map (the state-of-art qubit reuse compiler) do not account for this variability, circuits with frequent MCM operations often experience substantial fidelity loss.
  In thie paper, we propose MERA, a compilation framework that performs MCM-error-aware layout, routing, and scheduling. MERA leverages lightweight profiling to obtain a stable per-qubit MCM error distribution, which it uses to guide error-aware qubit mapping and SWAP insertions. To further mitigate MCM-related decoherence and crosstalk, MERA augments as-late-as-possible scheduling with context-aware dynamic decoupling. Evaluated on 27 benchmark circuits, MERA achieves 24.94% -- 52.00% fidelity improvement over the Qiskit compiler (optimization level 3) without introducing additional overhead. On QR-Map-generated circuits, it improves fidelity by 29.26% on average and up to 122.58% in the best case, demonstrating its effectiveness for dynamic circuits dominated by MCM operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires non-invasive measurements for fault tolerant quantum computing. Deviations from ideal quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements can disturb the encoded information.

Method: We develop a readout protocol for a $D-$dimensional system that, after a single positive outcome, switches to probing only the $D{-}1$ remaining subspace. This adaptive switching strategy minimizes measurement-induced errors by relying on negative-result measurement results that do not perturb the Hamiltonian.

Result: We apply the protocol on an 8-dimensional $^{123}{\rm Sb}$ nuclear qudit in silicon, and achieve an increase in the readout fidelity from $(98.93\pm0.07)\%$ to $(99.61\pm0.04)\%$, while reducing threefold the overall readout time.

Conclusion: These results unveil the effect of non-ideal QND readout across diverse platforms, and introduce an efficient readout protocol that can be implemented with minimal FPGA logic on existing hardware.

*Lijuan Dong,Aanal Jayesh Shah,Peter Kirton,Hadiseh Alaeian,Simone Felicetti*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Collective two-photon interactions enable enhanced photon blockade in quantum resonators, surpassing limitations of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how photon and multi-photon blockade can benefit from collective enhancement via two-photon interactions, as traditional methods fail to enhance antibunching by increasing the number of atoms.

Method: Combined an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations to analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator with a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters.

Result: Demonstrated that both single- and multi-photon blockade can achieve strong suppression of second or third-order correlation functions with increasing atom number, while maintaining unitary transmission.

Conclusion: Collective two-photon couplings are a powerful mechanism for realizing photon blockade, even in platforms where individual strong coupling is not achievable.

Abstract: Analogous to Coulomb blockade for electrons, photon blockade is a key quantum optical effect in which the presence of one photon prevents the transmission of subsequent ones through a nonlinear medium. Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typically requires achieving strong light-matter coupling, increasing the number of atoms fails to enhance antibunching. Here, we analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator that embeds a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters, combining an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations. We show that when light and matter are coupled via a two-photon interaction, both single- and multi-photon blockade can benefit from a collective enhancement. We propose different driving schemes in which the second or third-order correlation functions are strongly suppressed with increasing atom number. Differently from established methods, this collective enhancement of non-classical properties occurs with unitary transmission and is ultimately constrained only by decoherence. This demonstrates that collective two-photon couplings are a powerful mechanism for realizing photon blockade even in platforms where individual strong coupling is not achievable.

Recent advancements in technology led to a number of demonstrations which test non-classicality via specific computational tasks. Limitations of these experiments include dependence on complexity theory assumptions, susceptibility to hardware noise and inefficient verification, raising questions about their scalability. We propose to test non-classicality using a game based on complement sampling, an efficiently verifiable problem that achieves the largest possible separation between quantum and classical computation when both input and output represent samples from probability distributions. When restricting the input to instances inspired by the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, our game admits an exponentially large violation of classicality without relying on computational hardness assumptions. We execute the game on Quantinuum System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computers, with experiments consisting of thousands of different circuits on up to 55 qubits. The observed scores can be explained by a systematic adoption of a quantum strategy, further corroborating the quantum nature of the hardware in an efficient and scalable way.

Abstract: We investigate the fast-forward and time-scaling properties of superconducting resonators under a coherent drive. We propose a scheme for perfect displacement of a superconducting resonator by modulating the drive amplitude based on fast-forward scaling theory. Furthermore, we propose a scheme exploiting both the fast-forward and time-scaling properties that enables perfect displacement through detuning modulation. The proposed schemes are also applicable to a subsystem that can be effectively represented by a driven resonator. In particular, we apply the latter scheme to fast and high-fidelity displacement of a coupler between Kerr parametric oscillators.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a compact and efficient magnetometer with high sensitivity and contrast, avoiding bulky optical components.

Method: The method involves using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a diamond coupled to a microwave (MW) cavity for vector magnetic field sensing, enhanced by an AC bias magnetic field.

Result: The results show a 40% contrast (20x higher than typical optical methods) and a single-axis sensitivity of 250 pT/√Hz, with noise models predicting a thermal noise limit of 2 pT/√Hz.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the demonstrated NV center-based magnetometer achieves high sensitivity and contrast, with potential for further noise reduction.

Abstract: We demonstrate $4π$-steradian vector magnetic field sensing using an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a single-crystal diamond coupled to a microwave (MW) cavity. The MW cavity enhances the spin-photon coupling which enables efficient, high-contrast spin-state readout via MW interrogation and removes the need for bulky optical collection components. An applied AC bias magnetic field lifts the zero-field degeneracy of the four crystallographic NV orientations, allowing each orientation to be individually addressed and used for vector reconstruction of the magnetic field. The resulting magnetometer has a 40\% contrast (20x higher than typical for optical spin-ensemble readout) and achieves a single-axis sensitivity of 250 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ which is flat from DC to 1 kHz. Noise models of the composite spin-cavity system establish MW amplitude noise as the dominant noise source and predict a thermal noise limit of 2 pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$.

TL;DR: The Aharonov-Bohm effect's phase shift is explained by a puncture in the particle's configuration space topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the puzzling and counterintuitive nonlocality observed in the Aharonov-Bohm effect.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the role of the confined magnetic field in modifying the configuration space of the charged particle.

Result: The phase shift arises from the particle's response to the modified topology of the configuration space.

Conclusion: The Aharonov-Bohm effect can be explained by the puncture in the configuration space causing a phase shift in the quantum state due to modified topology.

Abstract: The Aharonov-Bohm effect is a physical phenomenon in which the quantum state of a charged particle acquires a phase shift that is directly proportional to the magnetic flux, $Φ$, due to a (classical) magnetic field, ${\mathbf B}$, which is confined in a spatial region from which the magnetic field cannot escape. Even though the charged particle is not allowed to interact with the magnetic field, it accumulates a phase shift that affects the interference pattern produced. Not surprisingly, this apparent nonlocality is puzzling and counter intuitive. In this work, we provide an explanation that explains the physics underlying this apparent nonlocality. We find that the role of the confined magnetic field is to impart a puncture in the configuration space, $\mathbb{R}^2$, of the charge. Therefore, the quantum state corresponding to the charged quantum particle acquires the phase shift due to its response to the modified topology of the configuration space, $\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$, corresponding to the charge.

Abstract: We present a Raman-based Distributed Temperature Sensor (RDTS) with centimetre-scale resolution for thermographic analysis of electronic circuits. Temperature is measured along a single-mode fiber routed across a custom printed circuit board (PCB) with 1 cm$^2$ heating elements, using optical time-domain reflectometry of Raman signals detected by superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). This approach enables two-dimensional thermal mapping of the PCB under heating configurations with multiple hotspots. A spatial resolution of 3 cm and a temperature accuracy of 2 °C are achieved with an integration time of 5 minutes. Thermography can be performed down to 77 K, revealing that the PCB thermal resistance decreases by nearly an order of magnitude compared to room temperature, due to enhanced convective cooling in liquid nitrogen. These results establish centimetre-scale RDTS as a robust technique for real-time, spatially resolved thermography of electronic circuits, particularly in regimes where infrared imaging is ineffective, such as at low temperatures or within volumetric electronic architectures.

Conclusion: The study establishes an intrinsic link between the Riemann Hypothesis and dynamical quantum phase transitions, positioning quantum computing as a powerful platform for exploring this mathematical conjecture.

Abstract: The Riemann Hypothesis (RH), one of the most profound unsolved problems in mathematics, concerns the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Establishing connections between the RH and physical phenomena could offer new perspectives on its physical origin and verification. Here, we establish a direct correspondence between the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function and dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in two realizable quantum systems, characterized by the averaged accumulated phase factor and the Loschmidt amplitude, respectively. This precise correspondence reveals that the RH can be viewed as the emergence of DQPTs at a specific temperature. We experimentally demonstrate this correspondence on a five-qubit spin-based system and further propose an universal quantum simulation framework for efficiently realizing both systems with polynomial resources, offering a quantum advantage for numerical verification of the RH. These findings uncover an intrinsic link between nonequilibrium critical dynamics and the RH, positioning quantum computing as a powerful platform for exploring one of mathematics' most enduring conjectures and beyond.

Conclusion: 相对熵在局部压缩态与真空态之间的发散性揭示了局部压缩与相对熵计算之间的不相容性，表明尽管局部压缩态是自由量子场理论中的合法态，它们与真空态的差异却是无限的。

Abstract: Relative entropy serves as a fundamental measure of state distinguishability in both quantum information theory and relativistic quantum field theory. Despite its conceptual importance, however, explicit computations of relative entropy remain notoriously difficult. Thus far, results in closed form have only been obtained for ground states, coherent states, and, more recently, single-mode squeezed states. In this work, we extend the analysis to multi-mode squeezed states, imposing that the squeezing generators be local either in space or in spacetime, which results in a continuum of squeezed modes. We provide a detailed and self-contained analysis of such states for a free scalar quantum field on Minkowski spacetime, connecting also with older results on the essential self-adjointness of the Wick square, and showing that they lie in the folium of the Minkowski vacuum representation. Although the local squeezing is natural from a foundational standpoint, we uncover a severe incompatibility between locality and squeezing: the relative entropy between a locally squeezed state and the vacuum generally diverges, however small the squeezing is. This shows that while locally squeezed states are well-defined elements of the state space of a free quantum field, they are infinitely different from the vacuum, in contrast to coherent states whose relative entropy with respect to the vacuum is finite.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient state preparation is crucial for quantum computing, especially for structured inputs like Dicke or near-Dicke states, where traditional methods require excessive resources.

Method: Combining logarithmic-depth Dicke state circuits with Hamming weight encoders, the algorithm utilizes binary partition trees, generalized weight distribution blocks (gWDBs), and leaf-level encoders for state preparation.

Result: The algorithm achieves a circuit depth of $O(k\log\frac{n}{k} + 2^k)$ and uses $O(n(k+2^k))$ two-qubit gates, significantly outperforming general state preparation approaches requiring $O(2^n)$ CX gates.

Conclusion: The recursive state preparation algorithm efficiently prepares leaf-separable quantum states with reduced circuit depth and gate counts, making it suitable for scalable quantum algorithms requiring structured inputs.

Abstract: Efficient state preparation is a challenging and important problem in quantum computing. In this work, we present a recursive state preparation algorithm that combines logarithmic-depth Dicke state circuits with Hamming weight encoders for efficiently preparing ``leaf-separable" quantum states. The algorithm is built on binary partition trees, generalized weight distribution blocks (gWDBs), and leaf-level encoders. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm by numerically simulating it on randomly generated target states with between 4 and 15 qubits. Compared to general state preparation approaches which require $O(2^n)$ CX gates, our algorithm achieves a circuit depth of $O(k\log\frac{n}{k} + 2^k)$ and uses $O(n(k+2^k))$ two-qubit gates, where $k < n$ denotes the subtree size. We also compare implementations of the algorithm with and without the use of ancilla qubits, providing a detailed analysis of the trade-offs in circuit depth and two-qubit gate counts. These results contribute to scalable state preparation for quantum algorithms that require structured inputs such as Dicke or near-Dicke states.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the low signal responsivity of nuclear spins compared to electron spins and explore enhanced magnetic sensing techniques.

Method: The researchers developed a new approach using hyperpolarized molecules with proton spins to investigate magnetic field responses, achieving significant magnetic amplification.

Result: Demonstrated orders-of-magnitude enhanced magnetic responsivity, achieved magnetic amplification in linear and nonlinear types, and observed anomalous amplification with dispersive frequency dependence.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the potential of hyperpolarized molecular nuclear spins for highly sensitive quantum sensors, with applications in accurate magnetometry and fundamental physics.

Abstract: The use of nuclear spins as physical sensing systems is disadvantaged by their low signal responsivity, particularly when compared to sensing techniques based on electron spins. This primarily results from the small nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and the difficulties in achieving high spin polarization. Here we develop a new approach to investigating the response of hyperpolarized molecular nuclear spins to magnetic fields and demonstrate orders-of-magnitude enhanced magnetic responsivity over state-of-the-art proton and Overhauser magnetometers. Using hyperpolarized molecules with proton spins, we report the realization of magnetic amplification in linear and nonlinear types. We further extend this amplification to hyperpolarized scalar-coupled multi-spin molecules and observe substantial magnetic amplification exceeding 10%. Moreover, we observe an anomalous amplification with dispersive frequency dependence that originates from magnetic interference effects. Our work highlights the potential of hyperpolarized molecular nuclear spins for use in a new class of quantum sensors, with promising applications in both applied and fundamental physics, including highly accurate absolute magnetometry and the exploration of axion-nucleon exotic interactions.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into quantum limit cycles and their similarity to classical limit cycles under noise, while connecting theoretical measures of quantum synchronization to experimental quantities.

Abstract: Limit-cycle oscillators are the basic building blocks for synchronization; yet, the notion of a quantum limit cycle has remained unclear. Here, we study quantum limit cycles and synchronization in the presence of continuous heterodyne measurement. The resulting quantum trajectories, i.e., time evolutions of the quantum state conditioned on the measurement outcome, make the quantum limit cycles apparent. We focus on the paradigmatic model of the quantum van-der-Pol oscillator and on two-level systems. Our work provides insights into limit cycles in quantum systems, emphasizing their similarity to classical limit cycles subject to noise. Additionally, we connect theoretical measures of quantum synchronization to quantities experimentally accessible via heterodyne detection.

Abstract: The compatibility of special relativity and Quantum Mechanics has been questioned by several authors. The origin of this tension can be traced back mainly to the introduction of the measurement processes and the corresponding wave function reduction, which play a crucial role in Quantum Mechanics. We approach this problem within a recent proposal for a model of Quantum Mechanics, where the measurement is explicitly described as a specific stochastic process. This implements ordinary Quantum Mechanics, where measurement and reduction are treated as phenomenological events of unknown origin without any physical justification. To state clearly the question, we first discuss and establish the effect of a Lorentz transformation on a generic wave function in space-time. This allows to formulate the relativistic version of the model. We then consider few thought experiments in order to analyze to what extent Quantum Mechanics follows relativistic invariance and find the specific critical points where non invariance possibly occurs. The relevance of this analysis on the experimental observations is also discussed.

Abstract: Subradiance is a phenomenon where coupled emitters radiate light at a slower rate than independent ones. While its observation was first reported in disordered cold atom clouds, ordered subwavelength arrays of emitters have emerged as promising platforms to design highly cooperative optical properties based on dipolar interactions. In this work we characterize the eigenmodes of 2D and 3D regular arrays, using a method which can be used for both infinite and very large systems. In particular, we show how finite-size effects impact the lifetimes of these large arrays. Our results may have interesting applications for quantum memories and topological effects in ordered atomic arrays.

Abstract: Quantum Computing is a rapidly developing field with the potential to tackle the increasing computational challenges faced in high-energy physics. In this work, we explore the potential and limitations of variational quantum algorithms in solving the particle track reconstruction problem. We present an analysis of two distinct formulations for identifying straight-line tracks in a multilayer detection system, inspired by the LHCb vertex detector. The first approach is formulated as a ground-state energy problem, while the second approach is formulated as a system of linear equations. This work addresses one of the main challenges when dealing with variational quantum algorithms on general problems, namely designing an expressive and efficient quantum ansatz working on tracking events with fixed detector geometry. For this purpose, we employed a quantum architecture search method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to design the quantum circuits for different problem sizes. We provide experimental results to test our approach on both formulations for different problem sizes in terms of performance and computational cost.

Result: The platform can discriminate between coherent and thermal photon statistics across two spatial dimensions with picosecond resolution, though retrieved distributions deviate from ideal ones due to vacuum contamination and amplifier response.

Conclusion: This work establishes a robust approach for measuring two-dimensional photon statistics while clarifying the fundamental factors that limit the fidelity of such measurements.

Abstract: Ultrafast imaging of photon statistics in two dimensions is a powerful tool for probing non-equilibrium and transient optical phenomena, yet it remains experimentally challenging due to the simultaneous need for high temporal resolution and statistical fidelity. In this work, we demonstrate spatially resolved single-shot measurements of photon number distributions using difference-frequency generation (DFG) in a nonlinear BBO crystal. We show that our platform can discriminate between coherent and thermal photon statistics across two spatial dimensions with picosecond resolution. At the same time, we find that the retrieved distributions deviate from the ideal ones, a consequence of vacuum contamination and the multimodal response of the amplifier. To explain this, we develop a temporal mode decomposition framework that captures the essential physics of signal amplification and fluorescence, and quantitatively reproduces the experimental findings. This establishes a robust approach for measuring two-dimensional photon statistics while clarifying the fundamental factors that limit the fidelity of such measurements.

Abstract: Digital-analog is a quantum computational paradigm that employs the natural interaction Hamiltonian of a system as the entangling resource, combined with single qubit gates, to implement universal quantum operations. As in the case of its digital gate-based counterpart, designing digital-analog circuits that employ optimal quantum resources often requires an exceedingly large classical computational time. In this work we find a suboptimal solution to this exponentially large problem, showing that it can be solved within polynomial computational time. In particular, we provide an exact solution for the problem of expressing arbitrary two-body Hamiltonians as the sum of local unitary transformations of an arbitrary Ising Hamiltonian, with the total number of required terms being at most quadratic in system size. This allows us to design a digital-analog simulation protocol that avoids employing numerical optimization over a large parameter space at the preprocessing stage, minimizing computational resources and allowing for further scaling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies on B centers in hBN focused on resonant excitation, leaving a gap in understanding their coherence properties under non-resonant excitation.

Method: Photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy was used to investigate the coherence and spectral diffusion of photoluminescence from a B center in hBN.

Result: The emission linewidth increases with laser power, showing homogeneous broadening and spectral diffusion at 10-100 microseconds. At low power, the linewidth is ~2 times above the Fourier limit, while at long times, it exceeds 1 GHz.

Conclusion: The study deepens the understanding of decoherence processes in B centers in hBN, revealing key insights into their coherence properties under non-resonant excitation.

Abstract: The potential of solid-state quantum emitters for applications critically depends on several key figures of merit. One of the most important is the quantum coherence of the emitted single photons, which can be compromised by fast dephasing and spectral diffusion. In hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), blue-emitting color centers (or B centers) are seen as favorable in this regard, in the light of prior studies mainly based on resonant excitation. Yet, their coherence properties in the more accessible regime of non-resonant excitation (or photoluminescence) has not been extensively characterized. Here, we investigate the coherence and spectral diffusion of the photoluminescence from a B center in the continuous wave regime using photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy. We determine that the emission lineshape consists in a homogeneous contribution, whose linewidth increases with the laser power, and which is broadened by spectral diffusion at a timescale of 10 to 100 microseconds. At low power and short time, the emission line is only a factor ~2 above the Fourier limit, while at long times, the inhomogeneous linewidth increases up to more than a gigahertz. Our work deepens the understanding of decoherence processes of this preeminent family of quantum emitters in hBN.

Result: The algorithm achieves reconstruction efficiencies comparable to classical methods while promising exponential speedup, with circuit depth reduced by up to 10^4.

Conclusion: The paper highlights a novel quantum algorithm adaptation for particle track reconstruction, demonstrating significant potential for exponential speedup in high-energy physics experiments.

Abstract: In the future high-luminosity LHC era, high-energy physics experiments face unprecedented computational challenges for event reconstruction. Employing the LHCb vertex locator as a case study we investigate a novel approach for charged particle track reconstruction. The algorithm hinges on minimizing an Ising-like Hamiltonian using matrix inversion. Solving this matrix inversion classically achieves reconstruction efficiencies akin to current state-of-the-art algorithms. Exploiting the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm for linear systems holds the promise of an exponential speedup in the number of input hits over its classical counterpart, contingent on the conditions of efficient quantum phase estimation (QPE) and effectively reading out the algorithm's output. This contribution builds on previous work by Nicotra et al and strives to fulfill these conditions and further streamlines the algorithm's circuit depth by a factor up to $10^4$. Our version of the HHL algorithm restricts the QPE precision to one bit, largely reducing circuit depth and addressing HHL's readout issue. Furthermore, this allows for the implementation of a post-processing algorithm that reconstructs event Primary Vertices (PVs). The findings presented here aim to further illuminate the potential of harnessing quantum computing for the future of particle track reconstruction in high-energy physics.

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centres (NVs) are promising solid-state nanoscale quantum sensors for applications ranging from material science to biotechnology. Using multiple sensors simultaneously offers advantages for probing spatiotemporal correlations of fluctuating fields or the dynamics of point defects. In this work, by integrating NVs with foundry silicon-nitride photonic integrated circuits, we realise the scalable operation of eight localised NV sensors in an array, with simultaneous, distinct readout of the individual sensors. Using the eight NV sensors and machine-learning methods for multi-point magnetic field reconstruction, we demonstrate microscale magnetic localisation of a 30 $μ$m-sized needle tip. Experimentally, the needle tip can be localised with an error below its dimension and tracked dynamically with high fidelity. We further simulate the feasibility of our platform for monitoring the position and orientation of magnetic microrobots designed for biological and clinical purposes. Without the complexity of bulk optics, our photonic-integrated multi-sensor platform presents a step towards real-life biomedical applications under out-of-the-lab conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore the efficiency of imaginary-time evolution for probing quantum criticality and to demonstrate the capability of iPEPS in studying dynamical critical phenomena in two-dimensional quantum systems.

Method: The paper employs infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) with the full-update strategy to simulate the imaginary-time relaxation critical dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model directly in the thermodynamic limit. Two types of initial states (fully polarized state and a product state with small magnetization) are used to explore the relaxation process near the critical point.

Result: For the fully polarized state, magnetization follows a power law scaling, allowing precise determination of the critical point and exponent. For the nearly paramagnetic state, the relaxation exhibits a critical initial-slip exponent, consistent with quantum Monte Carlo results.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that iPEPS is a robust and scalable method for investigating dynamical critical phenomena in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems, efficiently revealing universal features of quantum criticality.

Abstract: We investigate the imaginary-time relaxation critical dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) with the full-update strategy. Simulating directly in the thermodynamic limit, we explore the relaxation process near the critical point with two types of initial states: a fully polarized state and a product state with a small magnetization. For the fully polarized state, the magnetization shows a power law scaling $M\propto τ^{-β/(νz)}$ in the imaginary-time evolution, from which both the critical point and critical exponent can be determined with high accuracy. For the nearly paramagnetic state, the relaxation process exhibits a behavior of $M\propto τ^θ$ with $θ=0.1958$ being the critical initial-slip exponent, which is in good agreement with that obtained from the dynamic scaling of the self-correlation in quantum Monte Carlo method. These universal features emerge well before the system converges to the ground state, demonstrating the efficiency of imaginary-time evolution for probing quantum criticality. Our results demonstrate that iPEPS can serve as a robust and scalable method for studying dynamical critical phenomena in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.

Motivation: To investigate the ergodic properties of Brownian motion in heterogeneous media through the statistics of occupation times, addressing the behavior of systems with spatially varying diffusion coefficients.

Method: Using the Feynman-Kac formalism, the study derives analytical expressions for the distributions, moments, and ergodicity breaking parameters of occupation times in two models with spatially varying diffusion coefficients: piecewise-constant and power-law profiles.

Result: In the piecewise model, occupation times follow asymmetric arcsine and half-Gaussian distributions, indicating non-ergodic behavior. For the power-law case, distributions are Lamperti and Mittag-Leffler. A transition from non-ergodic to ergodic dynamics is observed as exponents vary.

Abstract: We investigate the ergodic properties of Brownian motion in heterogeneous media through the statistics of occupation times. Using the Feynman-Kac formalism, we derive analytical expressions for the distributions, moments, and ergodicity breaking parameters of occupation times in two models with spatially varying diffusion coefficient: a piecewise-constant profile and a power-law profile. In the piecewise model, the half occupation time and the occupation time within an interval follow asymmetric arcsine and half-Gaussian distributions, respectively, indicating non-ergodic behavior. For the power-law case, the corresponding distributions are the Lamperti and Mittag-Leffler. In both models, we identify a transition from non-ergodic to ergodic dynamics as the exponent vary.

Motivation: To explore the role of free cumulants in the context of the full Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) and extend its applicability to open quantum systems interacting with baths.

Method: The analysis extends the full ETH framework to a system-bath setup, examining both an idealized random-matrix bath and a realistic defect Ising chain bath.

Result: A universal scaling of microcanonical free cumulants of system observables with respect to interaction strength was uncovered, along with a connection to the thermalization dynamics of thermal free cumulants.

Conclusion: The study establishes a universal scaling of microcanonical free cumulants in system-bath setups and connects this scaling to the thermalization dynamics of thermal free cumulants, extending the applicability of the full ETH beyond closed systems.

Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) has been established as a cornerstone for understanding thermalization in quantum many-body systems. Recently, there has been growing interest in the full ETH, which extends the framework of the conventional ETH and postulates a smooth function to describe the multi-point correlations among matrix elements. Within this framework, free cumulants play a central role, and most previous studies have primarily focused on closed systems. In this paper, we extend the analysis to a system-bath setup, considering both an idealized case with a random-matrix bath and a more realistic scenario where the bath is modeled as a defect Ising chain. In both cases, we uncover a universal scaling of microcanonical free cumulants of system observables with respect to the interaction strength. Furthermore we establish a connection between this scaling behavior and the thermalization dynamics of the thermal free cumulants of corresponding observables.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore the dynamical aspects of nontrivial topology in a periodic spin-1/2 chain under strong magnetic fields using resonant parametric modulation.

Method: The method involves analyzing the response of a spin-1/2 chain to resonant parametric modulation, mapping excitations to fermionic excitations in the Kitaev chain.

Result: In the topological regime, the system exhibits either the absence of spatial magnetization correlations or their increase with detuning from resonance, depending on the modulation speed.

Conclusion: The study highlights the dynamic response of a spin-1/2 chain to resonant parametric modulation, revealing insights into topological regimes through magnetization correlations and modulation frequency control.

Abstract: Resonant parametric modulation is a major tool of studying magnetic systems. For a spin-1/2 chain in a strong magnetic field, the resulting excitations can be mapped on fermionic excitations in the Kitaev chain. We show that the response to the modulation turn-on allows one to reveal dynamical aspects of the nontrivial topology of the periodic chain. In the topological regime, depending on how fast the turn-on is, the system displays the absence of spatial magnetization correlations or their increase with the increasing detuning of the modulation from resonance. The transition between the topological and trivial regimes is controlled by the modulation frequency.

TL;DR: PGMs' electrical breakdown behavior is studied, showing how doping-induced asymmetry affects electrothermal feedback and device performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the robustness of hot-carrier-induced electrical breakdown in PGMs and its implications for device applications.

Method: Examination of S-shaped current-voltage characteristics in PGMs with varying doping levels, focusing on interdigital arrays of GMRs interconnected by GNR bridges.

Result: Doping and voltage bias create distinct carrier populations, triggering electrothermal breakdown and S-shaped current-voltage characteristics.

Conclusion: The study explores the electrothermal breakdown dynamics in PGMs, highlighting the role of electron-hole asymmetry in optimizing device performance.

Abstract: We examine the robustness of the S-shaped current-voltage characteristics associated with hot-carrier-induced electrical breakdown in perforated graphene metasurfaces (PGMs) as a function of doping. The perforation of the graphene layer forms interdigital arrays of graphene microribbons (GMRs) interconnected by graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. These GNR constrictions act as energy barriers for electrons and holes emitted from the GMRs and govern the inter-GMR thermionic current under an applied bias voltage. The doping and the voltage bias establish distinct electron and hole populations in adjacent GMRs. Peltier heating of these carriers within the GMRs increases their effective temperatures, thereby enhancing the inter-GMR current. The resulting positive feedback between carrier heating and current amplification can trigger an electrothermal breakdown, transforming a superlinear current-voltage dependence into an S-shaped characteristic exhibiting negative differential resistance. The degree of electron-hole asymmetry significantly influences this positive feedback and strongly modifies the overall current-voltage response. These results provide a framework for optimizing PGM-based devices employing GMR/GNR architectures, including voltage-controlled fast switches, incandescent emitters, and terahertz bolometric detectors.

Method: Theoretical investigation of the evolution of subharmonic gap structure in spinful Josephson junctions, considering spin-orbit coupling and external magnetic fields.

Result: Avoided crossings in the dispersion relation lead to pronounced multiple Andreev reflection features in conductance, with their visibility dependent on band spin polarization.

Conclusion: The subharmonic gap structure in spinful Josephson junctions exhibits pronounced features due to spin mixing and spin-orbit coupling, with visibility in conductance governed by band spin polarization.

Abstract: Multiple Andreev reflections in voltage-biased Josephson junctions give rise to the subharmonic gap structure in the conductance, which is widely used to characterize transport properties and estimate the induced gap in the junctions. Here we theoretically investigate the evolution of the subharmonic gap structure in spinful Josephson junctions. Spin mixing introduced by the spin-orbit coupling opens avoided crossings in the dispersion relation of the leads, which, as we demonstrate, subsequently results in pronounced multiple Andreev reflection features in the conductance traces. We analyze how these features evolve under an external magnetic field and explain that their visibility in conductance is governed by the spin polarization of the bands.

Motivation: To understand how electric conductivities reveal topological and magnetic properties in solids, particularly for two-dimensional unpaired Dirac fermions.

Method: The authors evaluated longitudinal and Hall conductivities for unpaired Dirac fermions using the self-consistent Born approximation.

Result: Disorder induces a metal-insulator transition near the charge neutrality point, enhancing longitudinal conductivity. For massless Dirac fermions, a minimal conductivity coexists with half-quantized Hall conductivity, indicating a parity anomalous semimetal.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that disorder can drive a transition between topologically distinct phases in unpaired Dirac fermions, as evidenced by the nearly semi-elliptic relation between minimal and Hall conductivities. This aligns with experimental observations in magnetic topological insulators.

Abstract: Electric conductivities may reveal the topological and magnetic properties of band structures in solids, especially for two-dimensional unpaired Dirac fermions. In this work, we evaluate the longitudinal and Hall conductivity for unpaired Dirac fermions in the framework of the self-consistent Born approximation and find a nearly semi-elliptic relation between the minimal conductivity and Hall conductivities in the Dirac fermions. Near the charge neutrality point, disorder may drive a metal-insulator transition, and enhance the longitudinal conductivity. For the massless case, the minimal conductivity $σ_{xx}^*$ coexists with the half-quantized Hall conductivity $e^2/2h$, forming an indicator for the parity anomalous semimetal. The relation signals a disorder-induced metallic phase that bridges two topologically distinct insulating phases, and agrees with the recent experimental observation in magnetic topological insulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the properties of tree analogs of Euclidean lattices (Lieb, double Lieb, kagome, and star lattice) and understand the emergence and interpretation of flat energy bands in non-Euclidean systems.

Method: Deriving the full spectrum of decorated Cayley trees as analogs of Euclidean lattices, analyzing their flat or nearly flat energy bands, and establishing mappings to topological edge states in one-dimensional chains.

Result: Tree analogs exhibit flat or nearly flat energy bands similar to Euclidean lattices, with interpretations as edge states localized to tree boundaries. Mappings to topological edge states in one-dimensional chains provide topological stability to these flat bands.

Conclusion: The study reveals a rich landscape of flat-band and topological phenomena in non-Euclidean systems, demonstrating how geometry alone can generate and stabilize unconventional quantum states.

Abstract: We derive the full spectrum of decorated Cayley trees that constitute tree analogs of selected two-dimensional Euclidean lattices; namely of the Lieb, the double Lieb, the kagome, and the star lattice. The common feature of these Euclidean lattices is that their nearest-neighbor models give rise to flat energy bands interpretable through compact localized states. We find that the tree analogs exhibit similar flat or nearly flat energy bands at the corresponding energies. Interestingly, such flat bands in the decorated Cayley trees acquire an interpretation that is absent in their Euclidean counterparts: as edge states localized to the inner or the outer boundary of the tree branches. In particular, we establish an exact correspondence between the Lieb-Cayley tree and an ensemble of one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, which maps topological edge states on one side of the chains to flat-band states localized in the bulk of the tree, furnishing the flat energy band with a topological stability. Similar mapping to topological edge states or to states bound to edge defects in one-dimensional chains is shown for flat-band states in all the considered tree decorations. We finally show that the persistence of exact flat bands on infinite decorated trees (i.e., Bethe lattices) arises naturally from a covering interpretation of tree graphs. Our findings reveal a rich landscape of flat-band and topological phenomena in non-Euclidean systems, where geometry alone can generate and stabilize unconventional quantum states.

Employing the mean-field approximation, we derive the equations of motion for the spin polarization and the two-time spin-spin correlation functions. The methodology is applied to the study of spin-wave dynamics and to the formulation of a phenomenological model for resistance fluctuations in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors.

Motivation: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) invalidates conventional Bloch band theory, necessitating new methods for analysis under open boundary conditions, especially in multiband systems where existing approaches are limited.

Method: The approach combines the WHF with Hermitian doubling to elucidate applicability criteria for the generalized Szegö limit theorem in multiband systems and proves its validity for symmetry class AII$^\dagger$.

Result: The WHF framework proves the generalized Szegö limit theorem for multiband systems in symmetry class AII$^\dagger$ and opens a path for generalizations to other symmetry classes.

Conclusion: The paper establishes the Wiener-Hopf factorization (WHF) of the non-Bloch Hamiltonian as a powerful framework for Amoeba analysis in multiband systems, providing a unified and rigorous foundation.

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the extensive localization of bulk modes at the boundaries, has attracted significant attention as a hallmark feature of non-Hermitian topology. This localization invalidates the conventional Bloch band theory, necessitating an analysis under open boundary conditions even in the thermodynamic limit. The Amoeba formulation addresses this challenge by computing the spectral potential rather than the spectrum itself. Based on the (strong) Szegö limit theorem and its topological generalization, this approach reduces the evaluation of the potential to an optimization problem involving the Ronkin function. However, while the generalized Szegö limit theorem is formally applicable in arbitrary dimensions, its implementation is limited to single-band systems, and its applicability to multiband systems remains unclear. In this paper, we establish the Wiener-Hopf factorization (WHF) of the non-Bloch Hamiltonian as a powerful framework, providing a unified and rigorous foundation for Amoeba analysis in multiband systems. By combining the WHF with Hermitian doubling, we first elucidate the applicability criteria for the generalized Szegö limit theorem in multiband systems. We then show that the WHF provides the natural mathematical origin for the symmetry-decomposed Ronkin function in symmetry class AII$^\dagger$, leading to a rigorous proof of the generalized Szegö limit theorem for these systems and opening a path toward systematic generalizations to other symmetry classes.

Result: The controlled formation of a magnetic double helix was achieved, stabilized by intrinsic exchange interactions and extrinsic emergent effects of the patterned geometry, hosting magnetic defects similar to supercoiling in DNA.

Conclusion: This study serves as a foundation for future research combining single crystal systems with 3D nanopatterning, offering new control over emergent phenomena in nanoscale magnets and quantum materials.

Abstract: Nanoscale topologically non-trivial magnetization configurations generate significant interest due to both the fundamental properties of their knotted structures and their potential applications in ultra-efficient computing devices. While such textures have been widely studied in two dimensions, three-dimensional (3D) systems can yield more complex configurations, resulting in richer topologies and dynamic behaviors. However, reliably nucleating these 3D textures has proven challenging, and so far, 3D configurations such as vortex rings and hopfions can often only be observed forming spontaneously in relatively uncontrolled manners. Here, we demonstrate that through the 3D nanopatterning of chiral single crystal helimagnets into nano-tori, the controlled formation of a magnetic double helix can be achieved. This surface-localized topological state is stabilized by the interplay of intrinsic exchange interactions of the single crystal with the extrinsic emergent effects of the patterned geometry. These double helices host magnetic defects akin to supercoiling in circular DNA and climbing vines. We expect this study to serve as a foundation for future research combining single crystal systems with 3D nanopatterning, offering a new degree of control over emergent phenomena in nanoscale magnets and wider quantum material systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed dissipative mechanism effectively drives Chern bands toward an ideal state, co-evolving Berry curvature and quantum metric to meet the trace condition, which is crucial for stabilizing fractional Chern insulators.

Abstract: We propose a microscopic, weak-coupling mechanism by which generic Chern bands relax toward ideal bands. We consider coupling interacting electrons to a Caldeira-Leggett like Ohmic bosonic bath. Using the Born-Markov approximation, Slater determinant states of a Chern band under Hartree-Fock approximation evolve toward Slater determinant states corresponding to an ideal Chern band. We validate our proposal by performing numerical simulation of a massive Dirac model, showing that the Berry curvature and quantum metric indeed co-evolve to saturate the trace condition. Our proposal provides a concrete dissipative route to realize ideal Chern bands, a fundamental building block for the stabilization of fractional Chern insulators.

Motivation: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has emerged as a direct probe of excitonic correlations, but the ARPES fingerprint of charged excitons (trions) remains unknown.

Method: Theoretical analysis of trion signatures in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides.

Result: Predicts how the additional charge carrier modifies the spectral position and shape relative to neutral excitons, with mass-imbalanced trions yielding a characteristic double-peak structure.

Conclusion: The study establishes a framework for ARPES studies of many-body Coulomb complexes in doped two-dimensional semiconductors.

Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has recently emerged as a direct probe of excitonic correlations in two-dimensional semiconductors, resolving their dispersion and dynamics in energy-momentum space, including dark exciton states inaccessible to optical techniques. However, the ARPES fingerprint of charged excitons (trions), which plays a key role in all doped and gated 2D material systems, has remained unknown so far. We present a first theoretical analysis of trion signatures in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, highlighting how the additional charge carrier modifies the spectral position and shape relative to neutral excitons in ARPES spectra. Interestingly, we further predict that mass-imbalanced trions yield a characteristic double-peak structure, clearly separated in energy and line shape from neutral excitons. The predicted temperature dependence of these features offers guidance for experimental investigations aimed at identifying trionic states, thereby establishing a framework for ARPES studies of many-body Coulomb complexes in doped two-dimensional semiconductors.

TL;DR: Theoretical study shows orbital torque in Ti/FM and Cu/FM bilayers varies with ferromagnetic metal and NM bulk origin, offering insights for light-metal-based devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited theoretical calculations of current-induced torques in light nonmagnetic metals (Ti and Cu) for orbital torque devices, despite their potential for energy-efficient magnetic devices.

Method: A systematic and quantitative theoretical study using semi-realistic tight-binding models derived from ab initio electronic structures was conducted on Ti/FM and Cu/FM bilayers (FM = Co, Ni).

Result: Torque in Ti/FM is larger for Ni than Co, but this trend does not hold for Cu/FM, indicating non-universal FM dependence of OT. OT's dependence on NM thickness shows its NM bulk origin, though quantitative characteristics cannot be explained by simplified bulk properties.

Conclusion: The study provides microscopic insight and practical guidance for designing light-metal-based orbitronic devices by revealing the non-universal dependence of orbital torque on ferromagnetic metals and the NM bulk origin of OT in Ti and Cu systems.

Abstract: The manipulation of magnetization in ferromagnetic metals (FMs) through orbital torque (OT) has emerged as a promising route for energy-efficient magnetic devices without relying on heavy metals. While Ti and Cu are among the most extensively studied light nonmagnetic metals (NMs) for OT devices, theoretical calculations of the resulting torque have remained limited. Here, we present a systematic and quantitative theoretical study of current-induced torques in Ti/FM and Cu/FM (FM = Co, Ni) bilayers using semi-realistic tight-binding models derived from ab initio electronic structures. We find that the torque in Ti/FM is larger for Ni than for Co, but this trend does not necessarily hold in Cu/FM, revealing that the FM dependence of OT is not universal but varies with the orbital current source. Moreover, the dependence of OT on NM thickness clearly indicates its NM bulk origin in both Ti- and Cu-based systems. Notwithstanding, the quantitative characteristics of OT cannot be explained by a simplified picture based on the individual bulk properties of the NM or FM layers. These results provide microscopic insight and practical guidance for designing light-metal-based orbitronic devices.

Abstract: Spins in semiconductor quantum dots offer a scalable approach to quantum computing; however, precise control and efficient readout of large quantum dot arrays remain challenging, mainly due to the hyperdimensional voltage space required for tuning multiple gates per dot. To automate this process, large datasets are required for testing and training autotuning algorithms. To address the demand for such large datasets, we introduce RF-Squad, a physics-based simulator designed to realistically replicate radiofrequency (RF) reflectometry measurements of quantum dot arrays, with the ability to go beyond the Constant Interaction Model (CIM) and simulate physical phenomena such as tunnel coupling, tunnel rates, and quantum confinement. Implemented in JAX, an accelerated linear algebra library, RF-Squad achieves high computational speed, enabling the simulation of a 100x100 pixel charge stability diagram of a double quantum dot (DQD) in 52.1 $\pm$0.2 milliseconds at the CIM level. Using optimization algorithms, combined with it's layered architecture, RF-Squad allows users to balance physical accuracy with computational speed, scaling from simple to highly detailed models.

TL;DR: STEM-EBIC study shows nanoscale carrier transport in FIB-milled silicon photodiode lamellae, revealing reduced diffusion lengths and surface effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and validate the application of STEM-EBIC for nanoscale carrier transport analysis in thin TEM lamellae, an area previously underexplored compared to bulk SEM geometries.

Method: A systematic STEM-EBIC study was conducted on silicon photodiode lamellae prepared by gallium and xenon FIB milling, including current-voltage measurements and visualization of p-n junctions.

Result: Effective diffusion lengths for electrons and holes were extracted, revealing values significantly smaller than those from SEM-EBIC on bulk silicon, along with deviations from expected diode behavior due to surface recombination and ohmic contacts.

Conclusion: STEM-EBIC is established as a quantitative probe for studying carrier transport in nanoscale devices, particularly in thin TEM lamellae, highlighting the impact of surface effects and FIB-induced modifications.

Abstract: Electron beam-induced current (EBIC) imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), STEM-EBIC, provides direct access to carrier transport at the nanoscale. While well established in bulk SEM geometries, its application to thin TEM lamellae remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a systematic STEM-EBIC study of silicon photodiode lamellae prepared by gallium and xenon focused ion beam (FIB) milling. We directly visualize the p-n junctions in thin cross sections and extract effective diffusion lengths for electrons and holes as a function of local thickness. The values are orders of magnitude smaller than those obtained by SEM-EBIC on bulk silicon, reflecting pronounced surface recombination and FIB-induced surface modifications. Current-voltage measurements further reveal severe deviations from the expected diode-like behavior, which we attribute to ohmic metal-semiconductor contacts in the emasurement setup. Our analysis establishes STEM-EBIC as a quantitative probe of carrier transport in nanoscale devices.

TL;DR: A symbolic regression model predicts Tc in hydrogen-based superconductors, revealing high-Tc candidates and electronic-structure insights for reduced-pressure applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate the discovery of room-temperature superconductors under moderate pressures by understanding and predicting Tc in hydrogen-based compounds.

Method: Developed a symbolic regression framework to predict Tc, focusing on an integrated density of states (IDOS) descriptor near the Fermi level.

Result: Identified four hydrogen-based candidates with high Tc values (e.g., Na2GaCuH6 with Tc =42.04 K at ambient pressure) and clarified the role of hydrogen-projected electronic weight near EF in governing Tc.

Conclusion: The study presents an interpretable framework using symbolic regression to predict superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) in hydrogen-based superconductors, identifying key electronic-structure descriptors and validating high-Tc candidates at reduced pressures.

Abstract: Room temperature superconductivity remains elusive, and hydrogen-base compounds despite remarkable transition temperatures(Tc) typically require extreme pressures that hinder application. To accelerate discovery under moderate pressures, an interpretable framework based on symbolic regression is developed to predict Tc in hydrogen-based superconductors. A key descriptor is an integrated density of states (IDOS) within 1 eV of the Fermi level (EF), which exhibits greater robustness than conventional single-point DOS features. The resulting analytic model links electronic-structure characteristics to superconducting performance, achieves high accuracy (RMSEtrain = 20.15 K), and generalizes well to external datasets. By relying solely on electronic structure calculations, the approach greatly accelerates materials screening. Guided by this model, four hydrogen-based candidates are identified and validated via calculation: Na2GaCuH6 with Tc =42.04 K at ambient pressure (exceeding MgB2), and NaCaH12, NaSrH12, and KSrH12 with Tc up to 162.35 K, 86.32 K, and 55.13 K at 100 GPa, 25 GPa, and 25 GPa, respectively. Beyond rapid screening, the interpretable form clarifies how hydrogen-projected electronic weight near EF and related features govern Tc in hydrides, offering a mechanism-aware route to stabilize high-Tc phases at reduced pressures.
