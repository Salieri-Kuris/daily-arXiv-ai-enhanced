However, the introduction of piezoelectric films, which are necessary for coupling to a superconducting circuit, can lead to additional loss channels, such as surface scattering and two-level systems (TLS). Here, we study the acoustic dissipation of HBAR resonators in cQAD systems and find that the defect density of the piezoelectric material and its interface with the bulk are limiting factors for the coherence. We measure acoustic modes with phonon lifetimes up to 400 $\u03bc$s and lifetime-limited coherence times approaching one millisecond in the quantum regime.

First, we prove via dimension-counting arguments that GLQEC requires periodic electric fields, thereby constraining the design space for lattice QED simulations. Second, we numerically compare GLQEC with a universal quantum error correction (UQEC) code, specifically the $d=3$ bitflip repetition code, and find that while GLQEC can achieve lower logical error rates in single-round error correction, it exhibits faster decoherence to the steady-state mixed ensemble under multiple rounds. The mixing speed penalty is manifest in observables of interest for both memory experiments and Hamiltonian evolution. We identify a mixing speed threshold, $p_{th}=0.277(2)$, above which using GLQEC exhibits even faster decoherence than without error correction.

Remarkably, this hardness persists even when arbitrary entangled operations, auxiliary systems, and fully adaptive strategies are allowed, indicating that conventional resources for state and channel learning are ineffective in this task. In contrast, when access to the post-measurement quantum state is available, the same task can be solved with constant query complexity using a simple measuring-twice protocol, without requiring resources that are useful for state and channel learning.

We formulate an information-theoretic description of dispersive readout that treats the measurement record as a stochastic communication channel and compute the classical Chernoff information governing the multi-shot error exponent using a trajectory model that incorporates T1 relaxation with full cavity memory. We find a consistent separation between the integration time that maximizes single-shot fidelity and the time that minimizes total certification time. For representative transmon parameters and hardware overheads, the throughput-optimal integration window is longer than the fidelity-optimal one, yielding certification speedups of approximately 9-11%, with the gain saturating near 1.13x in the high-readout-power and high-overhead regime. Comparing the extracted classical information to the Gaussian Chernoff limit defines an information-extraction efficiency metric and shows that typical dispersive schemes are limited to about 45% capture at short integration times by detection efficiency, decreasing to approximately 12% at the throughput-optimal integration time of approximately 1.22 us due to T1-induced trajectory smearing.

In particular, uncloneability underlies quantum position based-cryptography, which is unachievable classically. We design a consensus protocol that combines classical hybrid consensus protocols with quantum position verification as the Sybil resistance mechanism, providing security in the standard model, and achieving improved energy efficiency compared to hybrid protocols based on Proof-of-Work.

We prove a sharp controlled-jump rule showing that the controlled gate $CU$ lies strictly in level $m+2$ of the hierarchy, and equivalently that $CU$ lies in level $k$ if $U^{2^{k-2}}$ is Pauli while no smaller positive power of $U$ is Pauli. We further quantify the resources required to realize large level jumps in the Clifford hierarchy by proving an essentially tight upper bound on Pauli periodicity as a function of the number of qubits, which implies that accessing high hierarchy levels through controlled Cliffords requires a number of target qubits that grows exponentially with the desired level. We complement this limitation with explicit infinite families of Pauli-periodic Cliffords whose controlled versions achieve asymptotically optimal jumps.

Such systems are attractive for quantum information science applications, as advanced fabrication and processing can enable relatively long quantum coherence times, and precision control can be realized through optical, electrical, or qubit coupling. In many state-of-the-art systems, the phonon lifetime is limited by disorder. In particular, native oxides or damaged `dead layers' at surfaces can host two-level tunneling states that lead to a particularly problematic form of dissipation that increases at lower temperatures. As mechanical losses are driven down in systems such as micro-fabricated bulk acoustic wave resonators, tunneling states are expected to emerge as the dominant mechanism for phonon decoherence. A quantitative description of these mesoscopic systems therefore requires a framework that captures interactions between a selected phonon mode and a large ensemble of TLS. Here, we derive a quantum master equation for this coupled system, permitting the phonon decoherence produced by two-level tunneling states to be calculated. As an example, we estimate the lifetime of a variety of quantum states within quartz micro-resonators hosting a thin surface layer of tunneling states. We find that the phonon coherence time is maximized at low temperatures, in spite of increased mechanical dissipation, and that phonon-TLS coupling can be reduced for modes with strain nodes at the surfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
