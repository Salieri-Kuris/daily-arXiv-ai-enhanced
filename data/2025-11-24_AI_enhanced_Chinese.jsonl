Despite encouraging results in the closed-system setting, Ref. [1] has suggested on the basis of numerical simulations that ARA may lose its advantage in the presence of decoherence.

Using the $p$-spin model as a solvable example, together with the adiabatic master equation to describe the effects of the environment (valid at weak coupling), we show that ARA can in fact succeed in open systems but that the temperature of the environment plays a key role. We first demonstrate that, in the adiabatic limit, the system will follow the instantaneous equilibrium state as long as the protocol does not pass through any (finite-temperature) phase transitions. Given this, there are two distinct mechanisms by which ARA can break down at high temperature: either there are no paths that avoid transitions, or the equilibrium state itself is disordered.

Here, we use layer resolved capacitance measurements to directly detect these surface states for $N\\approx 13$ layer rhombohedral graphene devices.

We observe several superconducting states localized to a single surface state. These superconductors appear on the unpolarized side of the density-tuned spin transitions, and show strong violations of the Pauli limit consistent with a dominant attractive interaction in the spin-triplet, valley-singlet pairing channel. In contrast to previous studies of rhombohedral multilayers, however, we find that superconductivity can persist to zero displacement field where the system is inversion symmetric.

We propose that localized spins near the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain embedded in an insulating environment can be detected experimentally using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR). When the STM tip is in the contact regime, the tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, giving rise to a Kondo peak at low bias. Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides an indirect yet clear signature of these localized spins. To support this proposal, we use density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to calculate the spin gap and spin projection of end states for chains of various lengths and interaction strengths $U$ at half-filling. In the non-interacting limit ($U=0$), we derive simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for sufficiently long chains.

While unconventional spin transport phenomena have been predominantly explored in low-symmetry systems (e.g., $C_{1v}$ symmetry), high-symmetry crystals--which constitute the majority of industry-compatible materials--are generally expected to exhibit only conventional spin-transport behavior. Here, we report the coexistence of two unconventional spin transport effects, the crystal spin-orbit torque (CSOT) and the crystal in-plane Hall effect (CIHE), in a CoPt single ferromagnetic layer with $C_{3v}$ symmetry. Leveraging the CSOT, we achieve nearly 100% field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in a 6 nm CoPt layer at room temperature.

In particular, heat removal is directly linked to a fundamental requirement of quantum computation: the ability to reset a system to a pure state before computation. Efficient cooling is therefore crucial both for advancing our understanding of thermodynamics in the quantum regime and for enabling the development of modern quantum technologies. In this work, we devise a cooling task that exploits steerability, a fundamental form of quantum correlations, to demonstrate a provable quantum advantage over classically correlated scenarios in which steerability is absent. We quantify this advantage by the ratio between the heat removed using steerable quantum correlations and the heat removed using unsteerable classical correlations. Specifically, we show that steerable quantum correlations always provide a thermodynamic advantage in the cooling task. Remarkably, we further establish that the maximum achievable advantage is directly related to a geometric measure of steerability known as steerability robustness. Our results suggest that this thermodynamic advantage can serve as a witness of steerability.

Spectroscopic measurements serve as an effective means of elucidating detailed information about the system, such as the energy-level structure and the transition matrix elements of the KPO. Conventional spectroscopy requires the drive frequency to match an energy spacing with a nonzero transition matrix element. In recent years, a phenomenon called photonic resonance (PR) has been theoretically predicted in KPO spectroscopy. Specifically, resonance occurs under the condition that the detuning is set to $n/2$ times the Kerr nonlinearity, where $n$ is a natural number. However, under this condition the transition matrix element vanishes, and thus the mechanism by which photonic resonance (PR) arises has remained unclear. In this work, we aim to elucidate the physical origin of PR observed in KPO spectroscopy. We first performed theoretical calculations and experiments of spectroscopic measurements, confirming that PR can indeed be observed and that the theoretical and experimental results are in qualitative agreement. We then carried out an analytical study under the assumption of an ideal noiseless environment. Our analysis revealed that, although the transition matrix element of the external field expressed in the system's energy eigenbasis is zero, higher-order perturbative effects induce Rabi oscillations between the ground and excited states.

Large numbers of entangled subsystems also require experimentally accessible and practically feasible methods of verifying the genuine, i.e., simultaneous, entanglement of all subsystems. We have derived a class of entanglement witnesses suitable for $W$-states, which are states where a single excitation is coherently distributed across subsystems initially in their ground state or a state with low thermal occupation, e.g., via detection of a Raman-scattered photon. The entanglement is witnessed through violation of an inequality involving number statistics, which can be measured via detection of subsequent Raman-scattered photons. Unlike conventional, partially tomographic, witnesses, our method is experimentally accessible for both multipartite and continuous variable systems. The thermal robustness of the method is quantified by the initial thermal occupations for which violation occurs. As an alternative approach, we have derived an inequality which tests the nonlocal, or quantum coherent, nature of the photon measurement backaction which produces the $W$-state.

First, the experiment is not observing stationary states as claimed, but rather the time-averaged density of wave pulses which reflect off the potential step. Second, the proposed method for measuring a propagation speed is shown to be invalid for true stationary states. Third, the invalid method was misapplied to the time-averaged density, and this is shown to have created the false impression that it yields correct speed values for stationary states. These issues notwithstanding, for a wavefunction $\u03c8= Re^{iS/\\hbar}$, the velocity of interest, $\\vec{v}_s = -\\frac{\\hbar}{m}\\frac{\\vec{\\nabla}R}{R}$, is different than the Bohm velocity $\\vec{v}_B=\\frac{1}{m}\\vec{\\nabla}S$, and may be nonzero for stationary states.

We show that the intensities required for photodissociation are significantly lower inside the cavity than in free space, with a strong dependence on the type of driving condition.
