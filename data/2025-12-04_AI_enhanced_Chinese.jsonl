Achieving superconductivity at even higher temperatures, up to room temperature, represents the ultimate dream of humanity. As temperature increases, Cooper pairs formed through weak electron-phonon coupling will be disintegrated by the thermal motion of electrons, severely limiting the enhancement of Tc. It is imperative to explore new strong-coupling pairing pictures and establish novel condensation mechanism of Cooper pairs at higher temperature. Based on our recently proposed groundbreaking idea of electron e- (hole h+) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, namely, the eV-scale ionic-bond-driven atom-bridge (bridge-I) e--O-e- (h+-M-h+) strong-coupling itinerant Cooper pairing formed at pseudogap temperature T*>Tc in ionic oxide superconductors, we further discover that there is an attractive interaction between two Cooper pairs induced by the bridge atom (bridge-II) located between them. It is this attraction mediated by the bridge-II atoms that promotes all the Cooper pairs within the CuO2 plane to hold together and enter the superconducting state at Tc finally. Moreover, according to the Bose-Einstein condensation theory, we find that Tc is inversely proportional to the effective mass m* of Cooper pairs, directly proportional to n2/3s (ns: the density of Cooper pairs), and linearly increases with the scattering length a<0 due to attraction between two Cooper pairs. Therefore, according to our double-bridge mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity, increasing the attraction between Cooper pair and bridge-II atom, ensuring that ns takes the optimal value, and minimizing the effective mass of the Cooper pairs are the main approaches to enhancing Tc of ionic-bonded superconductors, which opens up a new avenue with clear direction for designing higher Tc superconductors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u6865\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6865-II\u539f\u5b50\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u5e93\u73c0\u5bf9\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u6709\u6548\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8Tc\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u952e\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u914d\u5bf9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u73b0\u6709\u8d85\u5bfc\u8f6c\u53d8\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u6781\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50-\u6c27/\u91d1\u5c5e\u539f\u5b50\u6865\u63a5\u7684\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u914d\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5e93\u73c0\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u53caBose-Einstein\u51dd\u805a\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6865-II\u539f\u5b50\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u5e93\u73c0\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u662f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8d85\u5bfc\u6001\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u5e93\u73c0\u5bf9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u6709\u6548\u8d28\u91cf\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8Tc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6865-II\u539f\u5b50\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u5e93\u73c0\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u79bb\u5b50\u952e\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53Tc\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8Tc\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Conventionally, multipole classifications rely on the magnetic point group of a system, which inherently incorporates the effects of relativistic spin-orbit coupling because the spin orientation is supposed to follow the point-group transformation of the lattice. However, this approach becomes insufficient in situations where relativistic spin-orbit coupling is negligibly weak or where the spin and orbital (lattice) degrees of freedom are decoupled, thereby requiring a more comprehensive symmetry description. In this work, we introduce a multipole description on the basis of spin-point-group symmetries, enabling a systematic exploration of nonrelativistic phenomena that persist even without spin-orbit coupling in a collinear antiferromagnet.

The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking.\n  We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation.\n  We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state.

Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is then used to extract the phase spectrum of the graph Laplacian.

To date, the existing proposals for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for CFD have almost exclusively been based on the Carleman embedding method, used to encode nonlinearities on a quantum computer. In this work, we begin by showing that these proposals suffer from a range of severe bottlenecks that negate conjectured quantum advantages: lack of convergence of the Carleman method, prohibitive time-stepping requirements, unfavorable condition number scaling, and inefficient data extraction. With these roadblocks clearly identified, we develop a novel algorithm for the incompressible lattice Boltzmann equation that circumvents these obstacles, and then provide a detailed analysis of our algorithm, including all potential sources of algorithmic complexity, as well as gate count estimates. We find that for an end-to-end problem, a modest quantum advantage may be preserved for selected observables in the high-error-tolerance regime.

We predict that fine-tuning laser power can enhance HHG entanglement features, which oscillate with driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. The oscillatory behavior is also predicted for above-threshold harmonics, and focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom is found to play a key role in entanglement measures.", "conclusion": "Our work establishes the state-of-the art in exploring entanglement features in HHG, and paves way for analysis and engineering of 'truly-quantum' multi-photon states in the XUV and ultrafast regime for more complex matter systems."}}

We introduce TARA (Test by Adaptive Ranks), a novel framework combining conformal prediction with sequential martingale testing for quantum anomaly detection that provides distribution-free validity guarantees. TARA offers two complementary approaches. TARA k, based on Kolmogorov Smirnov calibration against local hidden variable (LHV) null distributions, achieving ROC AUC = 0.96 for quantum-classical discrimination. And TARA-m, employing betting martingales for streaming detection with anytime valid type I error control that enables real time monitoring of quantum channels. We establish theoretical guarantees proving that under (context conditional) exchangeability, conformal p-values remain uniformly distributed even for strongly contextual quantum data, confirming that quantum contextuality does not break conformal prediction validity a result with implications beyond quantum certification to any application of distribution-free methods to nonclassical data. Extensive validation on both IBM Torino (superconducting, CHSH = 2.725) and IonQ Forte Enterprise (trapped ion, CHSH = 2.716) quantum processors demonstrates cross-platform robustness, achieving 36% security margins above the classical CHSH bound of 2.
