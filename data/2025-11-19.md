### [1] [Numerical analysis of heat transport in classical one-dimensional systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14347)
*Antonio Politi*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: 研究通过数值分析一维系统的热传导行为，发现理论预测的发散传导性在热力学极限下确实存在，且异常分量可能主导极端大尺度下的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究某些一维系统中理论预测的传导性与系统尺寸的发散行为，探讨能量通量的组成及其对传导性的影响。

Method: 通过对一些一维系统的数值研究，假设非平衡稳态下的能量通量可能是两种贡献之和：一种负责正常传导，另一种解释异常分量。

Result: 数值研究表明，在热力学极限下，发散的分量确实存在，并且对ding-a-ling模型的变体研究也支持这一结论。

Conclusion: 在热力学极限下，确实存在一个发散的分量，尽管向以异常分量主导的体系的过渡可能发生在极长的系统尺度上。另外，对ding-a-ling模型的变体研究表明，它同样在热力学极限下表现出传导性的发散。

Abstract: Numerical studies of some unidimensional systems provide evidence of finite thermal conductivity, where theory predicts a divergence with the system size. Some models are here reviewed under the working hypothesis that the energy flux across a nonequilibrium stationary state may be the sum of two contributions: the former responsible for normal conductivity, the latter accounting for the anomalous component. I conclude that in the thermodynamic limit, the diverging component is indeed present, although the crossover to a regime dominated by the anomalous component may occur at extremely long system sizes.
  Finally, I study a variant of the ding-a-ling model, previously claimed to satisfy Fourier law, showing that it too exhibits a diverging conductivity in the thermodynamic limit.

### [2] [Hybrid ab initio and empirical machine learning models for the potential energy surface](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14352)
*Pablo Peña-Cano,Pablo M. Piaggi*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: A hybrid machine learning model combines ab initio and experimental data, using a specialized loss function and reweighting, to accurately simulate liquid water properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between ab initio electronic structure calculations and experimental thermodynamic/structural observables by developing a hybrid machine learning model.

Method: The methodology involves a loss function incorporating the mean square error of experimental observables, along with energies and forces from ab initio data, and a reweighting procedure for on-the-fly calculation of ensemble averages.

Result: The hybrid model accurately reproduces experimental data such as the density maximum, density isobar at 1 bar, and radial distribution function for liquid water.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid model successfully combines ab initio data and experimental observables, demonstrating its effectiveness by accurately reproducing key thermodynamic and structural properties of liquid water.

Abstract: We propose a methodology to generate hybrid machine learning models for the potential energy surface trained simultaneously on data from ab initio electronic structure calculations and on thermodynamic and/or structural observables from experiment. The approach is based on the use of a loss function that includes the mean square error of observables with respect to their experimental values, in addition to the usual terms involving the mean square error of the energies and forces with respect to ab initio data. We employ a reweighting procedure that allows for the calculation of ensemble averages of observables during training for arbitrary values of the model parameters and on the fly. The method is general and can be applied to any set of static observables. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to the generation of hybrid models for liquid water that reproduce accurately the experimental density maximum, the density isobar at 1 bar, and the radial distribution function in molecular dynamics simulations.

### [3] [On the First Quantum Correction to the Second Virial Coefficient of a Generalized Lennard-Jones Fluid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14399)
*Daniel Parejo,Andrés Santos*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Compact formula for quantum correction to virial coefficient in generalized Lennard-Jones fluids, enabling analysis of dimensionality and stiffness effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To derive an explicit expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient for a generalized Lennard-Jones potential, addressing dimensionality and stiffness.

Method: An analytic expression is derived by introducing a change of variable, reducing the correction to a single integral evaluated in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions.

Result: The derived formula is more compact than previous representations, with applications in determining the Boyle temperature's quantum contribution.

Conclusion: The paper presents a compact and explicit formula for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient, offering direct access to asymptotic regimes and extending to higher-order corrections.

Abstract: We derive an explicit analytic expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient of a $d$-dimensional fluid whose particles interact via the generalized Lennard-Jones $(2n,n)$ potential. By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed. Moreover, the same methodology can be systematically extended to obtain higher-order quantum corrections.

### [4] [Nonlinearity-induced transition in heat conduction through a topological metamaterial of rotors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14560)
*T. R. Vishnu,Dibyendu Roy*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The KL rotor chain shows thermal insulation in linearized topological phases but diffusive conduction in nonlinear phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand heat conduction behavior in a one-dimensional chain of rigid rotors, especially in its linear and nonlinear regimes.

Method: Numerical analysis of heat conduction in linearized and nonlinear KL chains.

Result: Linearized KL chain acts as a thermal insulator at low temperature in topological phases with a band gap, becoming a ballistic conductor at the phase transition. Nonlinear chain shows diffusive heat conduction in all phases with varying thermal conductivity.

Conclusion: The nonlinear KL chain exhibits normal (diffusive) heat conduction in all topological phases, with finite thermal conductivity achieved in different system sizes.

Abstract: We investigate heat conduction in a one-dimensional chain of rigid rotors. The rotors are constrained to rotate in a plane about fixed pivot points and coupled by springs, such that in equilibrium, the neighboring rotors lie on opposite sides of the chain axis. The linearized limit of this model valid for small angular displacements, was first introduced by Kane and Lubensky (KL) as a topological mechanical insulator hosting zero-energy vibrational edge modes. We show that the linearized KL chain behaves as a thermal insulator at low temperature in both the topological phases with a finite band gap, and the heat current falls exponentially with the chain length. When the gap vanishes at the topological phase transition, the KL chain becomes a good thermal conductor and conducts heat ballistically. The chain of rotors for arbitrary angular displacements hosts nonlinear solitary waves and distinct topological mechanical phases. Our numerical analysis shows normal (diffusive) heat conduction in all topological phases of the nonlinear chain. Nevertheless, a finite thermal conductivity is achieved for different system sizes in different topological phases of this nonlinear chain.

### [5] [Search by Return: Stochastic Resetting in Fluctuating Harmonic Potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14646)
*Derek Frydel*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: A study on stochastic resetting with finite-duration returns, using a harmonic potential and feedback to ensure consistent starting points, introduces an efficient 'search by return' protocol with a closed-form MFPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of standard stochastic resetting (SR) processes, where return trajectories are treated as instantaneous, by introducing a realistic setup that accounts for finite return durations and imprecision in starting points.

Method: The study analyzes a fluctuating harmonic potential where return trajectories are forcibly terminated upon reaching the origin, ensuring consistent starting points for diffusive trajectories. This is achieved through instantaneous positional feedback, eliminating additional energetic costs.

Result: The results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism, particularly the 'search by return' protocol, significantly improves search efficiency by using return dynamics as the primary search strategy, providing a closed-form solution for MFPT.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the 'search by return' protocol, which utilizes return dynamics as the primary search strategy, offers a highly efficient alternative to traditional stochastic resetting methods, with a closed-form mean first-passage time (MFPT) highlighting its effectiveness.

Abstract: We study a class of stochastic resetting (SR) processes in which a diffusing particle alternates between free motion and confinement by an externally controlled potential. When the particle is recaptured, it undergoes a return trajectory that drives it toward a designated reset point. In standard SR, such returns are treated as instantaneous, but in realistic setups they have finite duration and introduce imprecision in the starting points of subsequent search attempts. We analyze a fluctuating harmonic potential in which return trajectories are forcibly terminated the moment the particle reaches the origin, ensuring that all outward (diffusive) trajectories begin from the same point. This is implemented through instantaneous positional information: a feedback signal that shortens the return phase without incurring additional mechanical energetic cost. We examine several search protocols built on this controlled return mechanism and determine their mean first-passage times (MFPTs). Of particular interest is a protocol in which outward diffusion is eliminated entirely and the return motion itself becomes the search mechanism. This "search by return" perspective reverses the conventional logic of SR and yields a closed-form MFPT that highlights the efficiency of using return dynamics as the primary search strategy.

### [6] [Effect of substrate miscut angle on critical thickness, structural and electronic properties of MBE-grown NbN films on c-plane sapphire](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13917)
*Anand Ithepalli,Saumya Vashishtha,Naomi Pieczulewski,Qiao Liu,Amit Rohan Rajapurohita,Matthew Barone,Darrell Schlom,David A. Muller,Huili Grace Xing,Debdeep Jena*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Higher miscut angles in c-plane sapphire improve NbN thin film structural quality and slightly increase superconducting transition temperature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how substrate miscut angles affect the structural and electronic properties of NbN thin films, particularly their superconducting transition temperature.

Method: Structural and electronic properties of NbN thin films were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) for films grown on c-plane sapphire with varying miscut angles.

Result: XRD and STEM analysis showed that structural quality improves with higher miscut angles, leading to a slight increase in the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) from 12.1 K to 12.5 K.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that increased substrate miscut angles improve the structural quality of NbN thin films, correlating with a marginal enhancement in superconducting transition temperature.

Abstract: We report the structural and electronic properties of niobium nitride (NbN) thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on c-plane sapphire with miscut angles of $0.5^\text{o}$, $2^\text{o}$, $4^\text{o}$, and $10^\text{o}$ towards m-axis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans reveal that the full width at half maximum of the rocking curves around the 1 1 1 reflection of these NbN films decreases with increasing miscut. Starting from 76 arcsecs on $0.5^\text{o}$ miscut, the FWHM reduces to almost 20 arcsecs on $10^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire indicating improved structural quality. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images indicate that NbN on c-sapphire has around 10 nm critical thickness, irrespective of the substrate miscut, above which it turns columnar. The improved structural property is correlated with a marginal increment in superconducting transition temperature $T_\text{c}$ from 12.1 K for NbN on $0.5^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire to 12.5 K for NbN on $10^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire.

*Maxim Tjøtta,Devashish Shah,Kanishk Modi,Marco Valentini,Rubén Seoane Souto,Georgios Katsaros,Jeroen Danon*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Non-invasive driving-based method extracts full CPR harmonics via critical current fitting, validated by simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for extracting CPR involve invasive techniques using SQUIDs/resonators; a less invasive, driving-based method is needed to extract full harmonic content.

Method: A driving-based approach fitting measured critical currents as a function of driving power to extract the full harmonic content of CPR, tested via numerical simulations and experiments.

Result: The method successfully and accurately extracts the full harmonic content of CPR even in noisy conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed driving-based method accurately extracts the full harmonic content of a current-phase relationship (CPR) in a non-invasive manner, validated through simulations and experiments.

Abstract: Extracting the current-phase relationship (CPR) of a single superconducting junction is challenging in practice and traditionally involves embedding the junction in a larger superconducting circuit containing SQUIDs and/or resonators. Applying ac driving to the junction has proven to be a viable and less invasive way to extract information about the few lowest harmonics of the CPR, by locating the integer and fractional Shapiro steps in the IV-curve of the driven junction. Here, we present an alternative driving-based method that allows to extract the full harmonic content of a CPR in a non-invasive way, by fitting the measured critical currents of the driven junction as a function of driving power. We test our method, both using numerical simulations and in experiments, and we show that it works very accurately, also in the presence of noise.

TL;DR: Systematic construction of KW duality defects using the strange correlator in a chain complex framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend previous research on Kramers-Wannier duality defects in statistical and quantum models by providing a more general construction framework.

Method: The authors employ the strange correlator, an overlap between a topologically ordered state and a product state, to construct KW duality defects systematically.

Result: A systematic construction of KW duality defects for a broad class of models within the chain complex framework, utilizing the strange correlator.

Conclusion: The work extends the understanding of Kramers-Wannier duality defects by providing a systematic construction for a broad class of models using the chain complex framework, with the strange correlator as a key tool.

Abstract: Defects associated with non-invertible symmetries have attracted significant attention in recent years. Among them, Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality defects have been investigated in both classical statistical systems and quantum Hamiltonian models. Aasen et al. analyzed duality defects in the 2D Ising model and in statistical models built from fusion categories, while Koide et al. later constructed a duality defect in 4D lattice gauge theory. In this work, we extend these developments by providing a systematic construction of KW duality defects/KW defects for a broad class of models formulated within the chain complex framework. Our construction employs the strange correlator, an overlap between a topologically ordered state and a product state, to realize these KW defects.

Motivation: To explore Kitaev magnetism in layered and exfoliatable materials, leveraging atomically thin material techniques to study and enhance Kitaev interactions for potential quantum computation applications.

Method: The paper surveys recent experimental and theoretical progress, focusing on the synthesis and fabrication of α-RuCl3 into van der Waals heterostructure devices. It also discusses the Kitaev model and its realization in materials like α-RuCl3.

Result: Key findings include a work-function-mediated charge transfer that enhances Kitaev interactions by up to 50% and recent results from electronic transport, optical, and tunneling spectroscopies of α-RuCl3 devices.

Conclusion: The review highlights the potential of α-RuCl3 as a test bed for studying Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials, showcasing experimental and theoretical advancements. The insights gained pave the way for discovering superior 2D Kitaev materials to realize quantum spin liquid phases.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids can arise from Kitaev magnetic interactions, and exhibit fractionalized excitations with the potential for a topological form of quantum computation. This review surveys recent experimental and theoretical progress on the pursuit of phenomena related to Kitaev magnetism in layered and exfoliatable materials, which offer numerous opportunities to apply powerful techniques from the field of atomically thin materials. We primarily focus on the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $α$-RuCl3, which exhibits Kitaev couplings and is readily exfoliated to single- or few-layer sheets, and thus serves as a test bed for developing probes of Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials and devices. We introduce the Kitaev model and how it is realized in $α$-RuCl3 and other material candidates; and cover $α$-RuCl3 synthesis and fabrication into van der Waals heterostructure devices. A key discovery is a work-function-mediated charge transfer that heavily dopes both the $α$-RuCl3 and proximate materials, and can enhance Kitaev interactions by up to 50%. We further discuss a wide range of recent results in electronic transport and optical and tunneling spectroscopies of $α$-RuCl3 devices. The experimental techniques and theoretical insights developed for $α$-RuCl3 establish a framework for discovering and engineering superior two-dimensional Kitaev materials that may ultimately realize elusive quantum spin liquid phases.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A theoretical mechanism explains the observed negative magnetoresistance in AFM semimetals via T2 symmetry violation, consistent with experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed negative magnetoresistance in layered AFM semimetals, which was previously missing.

Method: Proposing a theoretical mechanism based on the violation of binary T2 symmetry to explain the observed magnetoresistance in AFM metals.

Result: The mechanism is almost isotropic to the field and current directions and differs from known mechanisms like giant magnetoresistance and chiral anomaly.

Conclusion: The proposed intrinsic mechanism of magnetoresistance is strong in a wide class of layered AFM-ordered semimetals and is qualitatively consistent with experimental data.

Abstract: Layered van der Waals crystals of topologically non-trivial and trivial semimetals with antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of magnetic sublattice are known to exhibit a negative magnetoresistance that is well correlated with AFM magnetization changes in a magnetic field. This effect is reported in several experimental studies with EuFe2As2, EuSn2As2, EuSn2P2, etc., where the resistance decreases quadratically with field by about 5% up to the spin-polarization field. Although this effect is well documented experimentally, its theoretical explanation is missing up to date. Here, we propose a theoretical mechanism describing the observed magnetoresistance that is inherent in AFM metals and is based on violation the binary T2 symmetry. It is almost isotropic to the field and current directions, contrary to the known mechanisms such as giant magnetoresistance and chiral anomaly. The proposed intrinsic mechanism of magnetoresistance is strong in a wide class of the layered AFM-ordered semimetals. The theoretically calculated magnetoresistance is qualitatively consistent with experimental data for crystals of various composition.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research was motivated by the unconventional magnetic behavior observed in the verdazyl-based compound (o-MePy-V)PF6.

Method: Cluster mean-field approach was used to analyze the field-induced phase, focusing on the role of exchange interactions.

Result: Identified the formation of spin singlet pairs in specific field regimes and a one-half magnetization plateau, revealing the coexistence of ferromagnetism with antiferromagnetic dimers under enhanced frustration.

Conclusion: The study provides microscopic insights into the mechanisms driving nontrivial phases in the isotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model and offers theoretical support for interpreting experimental observations in low-dimensional quantum magnets.

Abstract: We investigated the isotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on an anisotropic square lattice with competing exchange interactions, motivated by the unconventional magnetic behavior observed in the verdazyl-based compound (o-MePy-V)PF6. Using a cluster mean-field approach, we explore a field-induced phase stabilized by the interplay between frustration and quantum fluctuations, focusing on the role of exchange interactions. We identify: (i) the formation of spin singlet pairs, signaled by enhanced spin-spin correlations in specific field regimes; and (ii) a one-half magnetization plateau, emerging from a subtle balance between competing exchange couplings and field-enhanced quantum fluctuations. Our results reveal that an enhancement of frustration, achieved by tuning small variations in the spatially anisotropic exchange interactions of the compound (o-MePy-V)PF6, can stabilize a field-induced quantum phase where ferromagnetism coexists with antiferromagnetic dimers. Our results provide microscopic insight into the mechanisms driving these nontrivial phases and offer theoretical support for interpreting experimental observations in this class of low-dimensional quantum magnets.

TL;DR: CMRT accurately predicts pressure-induced structural and electronic transitions in CeN, matching experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the structural and electronic transitions in cerium nitride (CeN) under pressure, particularly the B1 to B2 phase transition and changes in electronic behavior.

Method: Correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) applied to cerium nitride (CeN) under pressure.

Result: CMRT successfully predicts a first-order B1 to B2 transition with ~11% volume collapse and describes changes in 4f spectral weight, orbital occupancy, and hybridization, aligning with experimental data.

Conclusion: CMRT provides a parameter-free description and prediction of correlation-driven structural and electronic transitions in rare-earth compounds, as demonstrated by its agreement with experimental observations.

Abstract: We apply correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) to cerium nitride (CeN) under pressure. For B1 (NaCl-type) phase, CMRT gives an equation of state consistent with ambient pressure experiments. It produces electronic density-of-state (DOS) characterized by a sharp 4f quasi-particle resonance peak pinned at the Fermi level and two subbands formed by strong hybridization between the localized Ce-4f electrons and the itinerant Ce-5d and N-2p electrons below the Fermi level, consistent with XPS experiments. Upon compression, CMRT predicts a first-order B1 to B2 (CsCl-type) transition with ~11% volume collapse. Across the transition, the 4f spectral weight broadens, the 4f orbital occupancy increases, and the hybridization with conduction states enhances, signaling a crossover from partially localized to more itinerant 4f behavior. These features are in excellent agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that CMRT provides a parameter-free description and prediction of correlation-driven structural and electronic transitions in rare-earth compounds.

TL;DR: The paper investigates 4Hb-TaS_2's unique electronic properties, revealing interlayer interactions that reconcile Kondo and Mott-Hubbard models and link flat bands, charge orders, and superconductivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the emergent properties of 4Hb-TaS_2, such as time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity and spontaneous vortex phases, driven by debated interlayer interactions.

Method: Area-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy was used to probe the electronic structures of 1T- and 1H-terminated surfaces of 4Hb-TaS_2.

Result: The study revealed folded metallic states, chiral 'windmill' Fermi surfaces, Kondo-like peaks, and distinct charge orders, showcasing complex interlayer interactions.

Conclusion: The study reconciles the competing Kondo and Mott-Hubbard models in 4Hb-TaS_2, highlighting the interplay of flat bands, van Hove singularities, charge orders, and unconventional superconductivity in correlated superlattices.

Abstract: 4Hb-TaS_2, a van der Waals superlattice comprising alternate stacked Ising superconducting 1H-TaS_2 and cluster Mott insulating 1T-TaS_2, exhibits emergent properties beyond those of its constituent layers. Notable phenomena include time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity and spontaneous vortex phases, which are driven by nontrivial interlayer interactions that remain debated. Using area-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence of such interaction by systematically probing the electronic structures of 1T- and 1H-terminted surfaces of 4Hb-TaS_2. The metallic states of subsurface 1H-layers are folded to the Brillouin zone center by the sqrt(13) by sqrt(13) modulation of the surface 1T-layer, forming chiral "windmill" Fermi surfaces via Umklapp scattering. These conducting states further hybridize with the incipient flat band of the surface 1T-layer, producing a Kondo-like peak at the Fermi level. Interlayer charge transfer induces distinct 3 by 3 and 2 by 2 charge orders on the surface and subsurface 1H-layers, respectively, which result in characteristic segmented Fermi surfaces and dichotomously shift the van Hove singularities. These findings reconcile the competing Kondo and Mott-Hubbard models in this material and emphasize the interplay of flat bands, van hove singularities, charge orders, and unconventional superconductivity in correlated superlattices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the dynamic conductivity spectra and charge transport mechanisms in rare-earth dodecaborides, focusing on the role of Jahn-Teller dynamics and Yb-ion valence instability.

Method: The study involved analyzing dynamic conductivity spectra of RB12 (R = Ho, Er, Tm) and Tm1-xYbxB12 solid solutions at room temperature, separating Drude-type components and overdamped excitations.

Result: An additional absorption band above 200 cm-1 was observed, attributed to cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics. Non-equilibrium electrons dominate charge transport, and Drude-type carrier concentration changes by 20-40%. Strong renormalization of infrared response occurs in Tm1-xYbxB12 due to localized collective modes.

Conclusion: The study reveals that non-equilibrium electrons dominate charge transport in RB12 compounds with unstable boron lattices, and the metal-insulator transition in Tm1-xYbxB12 is linked to localized collective modes caused by Yb-ion valence instability.

Abstract: A thorough study of the wide-range (40-35000 cm-1) dynamic conductivity spectra of the rare-earth (RE) dodecaborides RB12 (R- Ho, Er and Tm) and Tm1-xYbxB12 substitutional solid solutions was carried out at room temperature. Both the Drude-type components and overdamped excitations have been separated and analyzed. An additional absorption band observed above 200 cm-1 in these RB12 with magnetic RE ions is attributed to the cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics of the B12 complexes, which depends crucially on the RE-ion cage space and is compared with the same effect found in the non-magnetic LuB12 and ZrB12. It was shown that non-equilibrium (hot) electrons participating in the formation of the collective JT modes dominate in charge transport, and portion of Drude-type carriers changes by 20-40% in these compounds with unstable boron lattice. Strong renormalization of the infrared response is observed in Tm1-xYbxB12 solid solutions with metal-insulator transition (MIT) and is discussed in terms of localized collective modes caused by Yb-ion valence instability. We demonstrate that even at room temperature the MIT is accompanied with simultaneous decrease in concentration of Drude-type electrons and redistribution of carriers to localized JT collective modes.

Method: 采用D-TRILEX方法自洽地研究铁磁涨落对电子谱函数和费米面的影响。

Result: 低能下电子谱函数分裂为两个带，且仅有一个带穿过费米能级，费米面面积增大，反映了非费米液体电子激发的存在。

Conclusion: 本研究通过D-TRILEX方法自洽地考虑了非局域贡献和电子相互作用顶点，展示了电子谱函数在低温下的分裂行为及其对费米面的影响，强调了这些效应的重要性。

Abstract: We consider the electronic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on a square lattice with the ratio of the next-nearest-neighbor and nearest-neighbor hoppings $t'/t=-0.45$, which favours the ferromagnetic instability. We find, that a self-consistent consideration of the ferromagnetic fluctuations within the D-TRILEX approach results in the splitting of the electronic spectral function at low temperatures. This splitting exhibits only a weak momentum dependence, and only one of the split bands crosses the Fermi level. As a result, the Fermi surface itself remains unsplit, but its area increases, reflecting the presence of non-Fermi-liquid electronic excitations. We show that both the self-consistent account of the non-local contributions to the electronic self-energy and the proper treatment of electron interaction vertices in D-TRILEX are important to obtain this behaviour.

### [18] [Hybrid Predictive Quantum Feedback: Extending Qubit Lifetimes Beyond the Wiseman-Milburn Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13774)
*Ali Abu-Nada,Aryan Iliat,Russell Ceballo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A hybrid method using a fast-decaying ancilla qubit and a predictor outperforms standard feedback, improving qubit lifetimes and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Amplitude damping limits qubit lifetimes, and standard Wiseman--Milburn feedback offers only modest improvement. A more effective solution is needed to recover information from both field quadratures and address loop delay.

Method: Introduces a hybrid upgrade with two components: (i) a coherently coupled ancilla qubit that recovers information from both field quadratures and decays faster than the system, and (ii) a supervised predictor to forecast the homodyne current, phase-aligning the correction to overcome hardware latency.

Result: Numerical simulations with IBM-scale parameters show a 3--4× improvement in qubit lifetime (T1) compared to the W--M limit, along with better population retention and integrated energy.

Conclusion: The hybrid upgrade method, combining a coherently coupled ancilla qubit and a lightweight supervised predictor, surpasses the Wiseman--Milburn limit, achieving significantly improved qubit lifetimes and performance, while being modular and hardware-compatible.

Abstract: Amplitude damping fundamentally limits qubit lifetimes by irreversibly leaking energy and information into the environment. Standard Wiseman--Milburn feedback offers only modest improvement because it acts on a single measured quadrature and its corrective drive is degraded by loop delay. We introduce a compact hybrid upgrade with two components: (i) a coherently coupled \emph{ancilla} qubit that receives the homodyne current and feeds back \emph{quantum-coherently} on the system, recovering information from \emph{both} field quadratures and intentionally engineered to decay much faster than the system; and (ii) a lightweight supervised predictor that forecasts the near-future homodyne current, phase-aligning the correction to overcome hardware latency. A Lindblad treatment yields closed-form effective decay rates: the ancilla suppresses the emission channel by a cooperativity factor, while the predictor further suppresses the residual decay in proportion to forecast quality. Using IBM-scale parameters (baseline \(T_1 = 50~μ\mathrm{s}\)), numerical simulations surpass the W--M limit, achieving \(\sim 3\!-\!4\times\) longer \(T_1\) together with improved population retention and integrated energy. The method is modular and hardware-compatible: ancilla coupling and supervised prediction can be added to existing W--M loops to convert leaked information into a precise, time-advanced corrective drive. We also include a detailed, student-friendly derivation of the effective rates for both ancilla-assisted and prediction-enhanced feedback, making the impact of each design element analytically transparent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore phases of abelian topological order and provide analytically tractable examples of phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.

Method: Construction of parametrized isometric tensor network states (skeletons) by conserving virtual symmetries of the tensor and imposing local isometry constraints.

Result: Stable finite correlation length deformations of string-net fixed points were obtained, and expectation values of generalized Pauli strings were efficiently computed using classical methods.

Conclusion: The constructed 'skeletons' serve as an organizing principle for abelian topological order and provide a non-trivial testbed for quantum processors.

Abstract: We construct parametrized isometric tensor network states -- referred to as skeletons -- that allow us to explore phases of abelian topological order and can be efficiently implemented on quantum processors. We obtain stable finite correlation length deformations of string-net fixed points, which are constructed both by conserving virtual symmetries of the tensor and by imposing local isometry constraints. They connect distinct topological phases via a shared critical point, thereby providing analytically tractable examples of phase transitions beyond anyon condensation. By mapping such classes of 2D tensor networks to 1D stochastic automata with local update rules, we show that expectation values of generalized Pauli strings of arbitrary weight can be efficiently computed using classical methods. Therefore these skeletons not only serve as an organizing principle for abelian topological order but also provide a non-trivial testbed for quantum processors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of characterizing entanglement structures in multipartite quantum systems by leveraging symmetries, and to extend the understanding of entanglement partitions beyond simple cases.

Method: The approach exploits inherent symmetries in multipartite quantum systems, utilizing weak Schur sampling with projective measurements to detect entanglement partitions.

Result: The method successfully characterizes all entanglement partitions for three- and four-partite states with specific symmetries, identifies bound entangled states, and provides analytical witnesses for larger systems.

Conclusion: The method enables a comprehensive characterization of entanglement partitions for three- and four-partite states, including the identification of bound entangled states. It also provides analytical tools for detecting entanglement in larger systems, with potential applications in quantum computing.

Abstract: We present a method to detect entanglement partitions of multipartite quantum systems, by exploiting their inherent symmetries. Structures like genuinely multipartite entanglement, $m$-separability and entanglement depth are detected as very special cases. This formulation enables us to characterize all the entanglement partitions of all three- and four- partite states and witnesses with unitary and permutation symmetry. In particular, we find and parametrize a complete set of bound entangled states therein. For larger systems, we provide a large family of analytical witnesses detecting many-body states of arbitrary size where none of the parties is separable from the rest. This method relies on weak Schur sampling with projective measurements, and thus can be implemented in a quantum computer. Beyond physics, our results extend to the mathematical literature: we establish new inequalities between matrix immanants, and characterize the set of such inequalities for matrices of size three and four.

Motivation: To address the exponential complexity faced by classical techniques in approximating the ground state of two-dimensional quantum systems.

Method: A hybrid quantum-classical algorithm using an isometric tensor network ansatz, optimized sequentially by diagonalizing effective Hamiltonians constructed with a tomography-inspired method.

Result: Demonstrated on the 2D transverse-field Ising model, achieving ground-state optimization on up to 25 qubits with modest quantum overhead.

Conclusion: The results offer a path towards scalable variational quantum algorithms in both noisy and fault-tolerant regimes.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for approximating the ground state of two-dimensional quantum systems using an isometric tensor network ansatz, which maps naturally to quantum circuits. Inspired by the density matrix renormalization group, we optimize tensors sequentially by diagonalizing a series of effective Hamiltonians. These are constructed using a tomography-inspired method on a qubit subset whose size depends only on the bond dimension. Our approach leverages quantum computers to enable accurate solutions without relying on approximate contractions, circumventing the exponential complexity faced by classical techniques. We demonstrate our method on the two-dimensional (2D) transverse-field Ising model, achieving ground-state optimization on up to 25 qubits with modest quantum overhead -- significantly less than standard solutions based on variational quantum eigensolvers. Overall, our results offer a path towards scalable variational quantum algorithms in both noisy and fault-tolerant regimes.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A single-quench protocol for generating unitary $k$-designs with minimal control, breaking spectral correlations and enabling practical quantum applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the generation of unitary $k$-designs with minimal control, overcoming the complexity of existing methods like Brownian schemes or frequent random quenches.

Method: A system evolves under a random Hamiltonian $H_1$, then is quenched to another Hamiltonian $H_2$ at a switch time $t_s \geq t_{\mathrm{Th}}$. This breaks residual spectral correlations to form higher-order designs.

Result: The protocol successfully generates Haar-like randomness with a single control operation and provides a measurement-friendly definition of $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$.

Conclusion: The proposed single-quench protocol provides a simplified method to generate unitary $k$-designs, offering practical applications in randomized measurements and quantum benchmarking.

Abstract: We present a single-quench protocol that generates unitary $k$-designs with minimal control. A system first evolves under a random Hamiltonian $H_1$; at a switch time $t_s \geq t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ (the Thouless time), it is quenched to an independently drawn $H_2$ from the same ensemble and then evolves under $H_2$. This single quench breaks residual spectral correlations that prevent strictly time-independent chaotic dynamics from forming higher-order designs. The resulting ensemble approaches a unitary $k$-design using only a single control operation -- far simpler than Brownian schemes with continuously randomized couplings or protocols that apply random quenches at short time intervals. Beyond offering a direct route to Haar-like randomness, the protocol yields an operational, measurement-friendly definition of $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ and provides a quantitative diagnostic of chaoticity. It further enables symmetry-resolved and open-system extensions, circuit-level single-quench analogs, and immediate applications to randomized measurements, benchmarking, and tomography.

Motivation: To extend analysis of superconducting transmission-line resonators beyond the perturbative regime for accurate parameter extraction.

Method: Developed an analytic framework to extract parameters without full-wave simulations, validated via circuit simulations, finite-element modeling, and experimental measurements.

Result: Consistent and reproducible extraction of capacitance and loss tangent, in agreement with literature values, with additional design guidelines.

Conclusion: The analytic framework successfully extracts circuit parameters and loss tangent from superconducting transmission-line resonators, validated through simulations and experiments, and provides practical design guidelines.

Abstract: We develop an analytic framework to extract circuit parameters and loss tangent from superconducting transmission-line resonators terminated by reactive loads, extending analysis beyond the perturbative regime. The formulation yields closed-form relations between resonant frequency, participation ratio, and internal quality factor, removing the need for full-wave simulations. We validate the framework through circuit simulations, finite-element modeling, and experimental measurements of van der Waals parallel-plate capacitors, using it to extract the dielectric constant and loss tangent of hexagonal boron nitride. Statistical analysis across multiple reference resonators, together with multimode self-calibration, demonstrates consistent and reproducible extraction of both capacitance and loss tangent in close agreement with literature values. In addition to parameter extraction, the analytic relations provide practical design guidelines for maximizing energy participation ratio in the load and improving the precision of resonator-based material metrology.

Motivation: To investigate whether nonstabiliserness, a key resource for quantum advantage, can be generated simply by coupling stabiliser states to a heat bath, and to understand the conditions under which this is possible.

Method: The paper explores the thermodynamic limits of nonstabiliserness under minimal assumptions, deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for its generation from stabiliser states coupled to a heat bath.

Result: An analytic characterisation of the nonstabiliser states achievable through this process, along with quantitative bounds on their nonstabiliserness. Identification of optimal Hamiltonians and critical temperatures for nonstabiliserness generation.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework to understand the thermodynamic limits and optimal conditions for generating nonstabiliserness, including the identification of Hamiltonians and critical temperatures for maximizing nonstabiliserness.

Abstract: Nonstabiliserness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, capturing how much a quantum state breaks the symmetries that would make it classically simulable. Can nonstabiliserness be generated from stabiliser states simply by coupling them to a heat bath? We explore the thermodynamic limits of nonstabiliserness under minimal assumptions and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for when such a process can create it from an initial stabiliser state. This provides an analytic characterisation of the nonstabiliser states that are reachable in this way, together with quantitative bounds on their degree of nonstabiliserness. Our framework also identifies optimal regimes, specifying Hamiltonians that maximise nonstabiliserness generation and the critical temperatures at which it emerges.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Fermionic Born Machines enable efficient classical training of quantum generative models with structured circuits, while quantum devices remain essential for sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trainability challenges in quantum generative learning, particularly the difficulty in experimental gradient estimations, by leveraging structured quantum generative models that enable classical training.

Method: The model uses parameterized magic states and fermionic linear optical (FLO) transformations with learnable parameters. Training involves decomposing magic states into Gaussian operators for efficient expectation value estimation.

Result: The Fermionic Born Machines exhibit a favorable loss landscape for optimization and can be implemented on qubit architectures for sampling during inference, showcasing computational advantages.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of Fermionic Born Machines as a classically trainable quantum generative model, supported by numerical experiments on systems up to 160 qubits.

Abstract: Quantum generative learning is a promising application of quantum computers, but faces several trainability challenges, including the difficulty in experimental gradient estimations. For certain structured quantum generative models, however, expectation values of local observables can be efficiently computed on a classical computer, enabling fully classical training without quantum gradient evaluations. Although training is classically efficient, sampling from these circuits is still believed to be classically hard, so inference must be carried out on a quantum device, potentially yielding a computational advantage. In this work, we introduce Fermionic Born Machines as an example of such classically trainable quantum generative models. The model employs parameterized magic states and fermionic linear optical (FLO) transformations with learnable parameters. The training exploits a decomposition of the magic states into Gaussian operators, which permits efficient estimation of expectation values. Furthermore, the specific structure of the ansatz induces a loss landscape that exhibits favorable characteristics for optimization. The FLO circuits can be implemented, via fermion-to-qubit mappings, on qubit architectures to sample from the learned distribution during inference. Numerical experiments on systems up to 160 qubits demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and training framework.

### [26] [Halving the Cost of Controlled Time-Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13855)
*William A. Simon,Peter J. Love*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new compilation scheme reduces the number of arbitrary rotations in controlled Trotterized quantum simulations, lowering the fault-tolerant implementation cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum simulation algorithms require controlled time evolution unitaries, but existing methods significantly increase computational resources, particularly the number of arbitrary rotations, which dominate the T-cost in fault-tolerant architectures.

Method: The paper introduces a compilation scheme that avoids increasing the number of arbitrary rotations for symmetric Trotterizations, specifically applicable to second-order and higher Suzuki-Trotter decompositions.

Result: The scheme halves the number of arbitrary rotations required for controlled Trotterized time evolution compared to the standard approach, reducing the overall resource cost.

Conclusion: The proposed compilation scheme effectively reduces the cost of fault-tolerant quantum simulation by minimizing the number of arbitrary rotations, matching it to that of uncontrolled Trotter evolution.

Abstract: Quantum simulation is a promising application for quantum computing. Quantum simulation algorithms may require the ability to control the time evolution unitary. Naive techniques to control a unitary can substantially increase the required computational resources. A standard approach to controlling Trotterized time evolution doubles the number of single-qubit arbitrary rotations. Here, we describe a compilation scheme that does not increase the number of arbitrary rotations for symmetric Trotterizations, which applies to second-order and higher Suzuki-Trotter decompositions. This halves the number of arbitrary rotations required to implement controlled, Trotterized time evolution compared to the standard approach. Arbitrary rotations contribute significantly to resource estimates in a fault-tolerant architecture due to the number of required magic states. Therefore, arbitrary rotations dominate the $T$-cost of fault-tolerant implementations of quantum simulation. This construction reduces the number of arbitrary rotations for controlled Trotter evolution to that of uncontrolled Trotter evolution, thereby reducing the cost of fault-tolerant quantum simulation.

Motivation: To examine the relationship between linguistic regularities and computational search complexity, utilizing historical texts to derive probabilistic baselines for evaluating cipher search processes.

Method: Hybrid classical-quantum framework using character-based n-gram models from Renaissance Italian texts, combining classical hill climbing and simulated annealing with Grover-style quantum-inspired estimates and a QUBO annealing formulation.

Result: Empirical results confirm the predicted dependence of Grover oracle calls on 1/sqrt(pgood), showing longer texts yield sharper score distributions and smaller feasible key regions.

Conclusion: The study establishes a quantitative link between linguistic redundancy and search-space contraction, offering a framework for comparing classical, quantum-inspired, and idealized quantum search dynamics under unified constraints.

Abstract: This study examines the quantitative relationship between linguistic regularities and computational search complexity through a hybrid classical-quantum framework applied to Renaissance Italian texts. Using four representative works from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries-Il Principe (Machiavelli), Il Cortegiano (Castiglione), I Ricordi (Guicciardini), and Orlando Furioso (Ariosto)-we construct character-based n-gram models under both a historically grounded 25-letter orthography and the full modern Italian alphabet. These models provide corpus-derived probabilistic baselines for evaluating substitution-cipher search processes. Combining classical hill climbing and simulated annealing with Grover-style quantum-inspired estimates and a QUBO annealing formulation, we quantify how the probability that a key produces a linguistically plausible decryption (pgood) relates to expected computational effort. Across cipher lengths from 200 to 1000 characters, empirical results confirm the predicted dependence of Grover oracle calls on 1/sqrt(pgood) and show that longer texts yield sharper score distributions and smaller feasible key regions. Overall, the findings establish a link between linguistic redundancy and search-space contraction, providing an empirical framework for comparing classical, quantum-inspired, and idealized quantum search dynamics under unified corpus-driven constraints.

Result: 通过模拟氢分子电子波函数的时间演化验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: CETE算法通过单次关联显著减少了电路深度，为强关联系统在近期量子设备上的模拟提供了潜力。

Abstract: We introduce the correlation-efficient time-evolution (CETE) algorithm for simulating quantum many-body dynamics. CETE recasts each step of time evolution as a time-independent correlation problem: the ansatz begins from a mean-field single Slater determinant and is then correlated to capture the true time-evolved state. We derive this exact ansatz from a contraction of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation onto the space of two electrons. Unlike conventional evolution by sequential short-time propagators, which must both correlate and decorrelate the state as the degree of correlation fluctuates in time, CETE correlates only once. This substantially reduces circuit depth, extending accessible simulation times on near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate the approach by simulating the time evolution of the hydrogen molecule's electronic wavefunction, highlighting the potential for the CETE algorithm to simulate strongly correlated systems on near-term devices.

Motivation: To develop an efficient and directionally controllable single-photon router, leveraging the unique properties of a giant-atom-like array and waveguides.

Method: A quantum routing mechanism is examined using a giant-atom-like array of three-level systems coupled to two one-dimensional waveguides, with strong atom-waveguide coupling and weak inter-atomic interactions.

Result: The system achieves perfect photon transfer (100% efficiency) over a wide energy range, with dynamic control over the output channel through adjustments in coupling sites, photon energy, and inter-atomic coupling strength.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates robust and scalable routing performance, highlighting its potential for reconfigurable and integrated quantum photonic networks.

Abstract: We examine a quantum routing mechanism utilizing a giant-atom-like array coupled to two one-dimensional waveguides. The giant-atom-like array is formed by a one-dimensional array of three-level-systems. In the regime of strong atom-waveguide coupling and weak inter-atomic interactions, this system functions as an efficient and directionally controllable single-photon router. Our analysis shows that the routing behavior is influenced by effective phase accumulation and interference effects, which can be adjusted by varying the number of coupling sites $N$, the photon energy $E$, and the inter-atomic coupling strength $J$. Importantly, we identify configurations that enable perfect photon transfer ($100 \%$ efficiency) over a wide range of energies and that provide dynamic control over the output channel. In addition, we investigate how the system responds to changes in its internal parameters, demonstrating the robustness and scalability of routing performance. These findings underscore the potential of this setup for implementation in reconfigurable and integrated quantum photonic networks.

Method: Utilizing photon detection to entangle highly-excited ensembles of two-level emitters, forming a collective spin characterized by a squeezing parameter detected via far-field measurements.

Result: Photon detection enables entanglement, with successive detections acting as a purification process to counteract decoherence and restore spin squeezing.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a novel method to generate postselected entanglement in highly-excited ensembles of two-level emitters using photon detection, offering new possibilities for open quantum systems.

Abstract: Postselection is a non-deterministic mechanism to entangle subsystems, often used in weakly-excited systems. We here show how highly-excited ensembles of two-level emitters can be entangled by photon detection. A collective spin is formed, characterized by a squeezing parameter detected by far-field measurements. While decoherence is detrimental to this conditional entanglement, successive photon detections act as a purification process and restores the spin squeezing. Our work opens up new avenues for the generation of postselected entanglement in open quantum systems.

Motivation: To achieve controllable enhancement of quantum resources like entanglement and squeezing in entangled coherent states while minimizing disturbance to the quantum state.

Method: The von Neumann measurement model is used to describe the weak-value amplification of the pointer state. The joint Wigner function analysis in phase space and the Hillery-Zubairy criterion are employed to quantify entanglement and quantum Fisher information.

Result: Significant enhancement of squeezing and entanglement is achieved by tuning the measurement coupling strength. The quantum Fisher information shows systematic improvement in phase estimation precision.

Conclusion: The study establishes a tunable weak measurement framework for precise manipulation of continuous-variable entangled states, providing a theoretical pathway for enhancing quantum metrology and state engineering.

Abstract: The present study systematically investigates the modulation mechanism of post-selected weak measurement (WM) on the non-classical properties of entangled coherent states (ECSs). The primary goal is achieving controllable enhancement of quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezing, while minimising disturbance to the quantum state. We theoretically analyze the post-selected weak measurement process, and its effectiveness in amplifying the non-classical features of ECSs. The von Neumann measurement model is employed to analytically describe the weak-value amplification of the pointer state. It is demonstrated that a significant enhancement of squeezing can be achieved by tuning the measurement coupling strength. The joint Wigner function analysis in phase space further reveals that, as the coupling strength increases, the coherent structure of the state evolves from symmetric double peaks to multi-branch quantum interference fringes. The entanglement, quantified by the Hillery-Zubairy criterion, exhibits a pronounced increase with stronger coupling, while the quantum Fisher information indicates a systematic improvement in phase estimation precision. The results obtained establish a tunable weak measurement framework for precise manipulation of continuous-variable entangled states. This provides a feasible theoretical pathway for enhancing quantum metrology and measurement-based state engineering.

Method: The authors apply Dirac's theory of constrained systems to promote thermodynamic variables to operators in a Hilbert space, treating them as conjugate pairs of coordinates and momenta.

Result: The formalism successfully derives thermodynamic uncertainty relations and restores Hermiticity of the temperature operator using a pseudo-Hermitian framework.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel canonical quantization approach for Equilibrium Thermodynamics, demonstrating its applicability to various thermodynamic systems and suggesting extensions to quantum and topological phase transitions.

Abstract: We formulate a canonical quantization of Equilibrium Thermodynamics by applying Dirac's theory of constrained systems. Thermodynamic variables are treated as conjugate pairs of coordinates and momenta, allowing extensive and intensive quantities to be promoted to operators in a Hilbert space. The formalism is applied to the ideal gas, the van der Waals gas, and the photon gas, illustrating both first- and second-class quantization procedures. For the ideal gas, a Schrödinger-like equation emerges in which entropy plays the role of time, and the wave function acquires a phase determined by the internal energy. A pseudo-Hermitian framework restores Hermiticity of the temperature operator and establishes the equivalence among constraint realizations. The approach naturally leads to thermodynamic uncertainty relations and suggests extensions to quantum and topological phase transitions, as well as black-hole and non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how high-order controlled processes can reduce the limitations imposed by noise on the predictability of quantum measurements in memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relations.

Method: The researchers analyzed the behavior of MA-EUR under noisy dynamics using high-order controlled processes (quantum switch and quantum time-flip) with the control qubit as the measurement system and the target qubit as a noisy quantum memory.

Result: Feeding Pauli channels into the quantum switch and quantum time-flip significantly reduces the total entropic uncertainty compared to their direct application.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that indefinite causal order and input-output direction, implemented via the quantum switch and quantum time-flip, can effectively mitigate noise effects in memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relations, reducing total entropic uncertainty.

Abstract: Entropic uncertainty relations quantify the limits on the predictability of quantum measurements. When the measured system is correlated with a quantum memory, these limits are described by the memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation (MA-EUR). We examine the behavior of MA-EUR when the memory qubit undergoes noisy dynamics implemented via high-order controlled processes, namely, the quantum switch and the quantum time-flip. We consider a setting in which the control qubit is the very system on which the measurements are performed, while the target qubit serves as a noisy quantum memory. Focusing on Pauli channels, we show that feeding them into the quantum switch and the quantum time-flip can significantly reduce the total entropic uncertainty as compared to their direct application. Our results reveal that indefinite causal order and input-output direction can serve as resources to mitigate the effects of noise in the context of MA-EUR and its applications.

TL;DR: A method using communication matrices to differentiate and characterize quantum channels, with self-testing capabilities and potential for relaxed assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of differentiating and reconstructing quantum channels from limited measurement statistics, especially when lacking full knowledge of the experimental set-up.

Method: Using the communication matrix formalism to represent measurement statistics and analyze the rank and information storability of the matrix.

Result: Informational completeness is necessary and sufficient for differentiating quantum channels. The rank of the communication matrix indicates information completeness, and information storability enables self-testing of the set-up.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the communication matrix formalism is effective for differentiating and characterizing quantum channels, with informational completeness being a key requirement. Self-testing the set-up using information storability provides a semi-device-independent approach, and additional resources can relax some assumptions.

Abstract: We look into the task of differentiating between any two quantum channels and reconstructing them from the obtained measurement statistics with possibly limited information about the experimental set-up. We employ the communication matrix formalism where the measurement statistics of a prepare-and-measure scenario is represented as a stochastic communication matrix. In order to differentiate between any two quantum channels, the informational completeness of the set-up is both necessary and sufficient. On the other hand, if we want to uniquely characterize any quantum channel, in addition we also need to have a complete description of the set-up. We show that in many important cases we can deduce this information directly from the communication matrix of the set-up before applying the channel. Given that we trust the dimension of the system, we show that we can deduce the information completeness of the set-up directly from the rank of the communication matrix. Furthermore, we show that another quantity of the communication matrix, called the information storability, can be used to self-test the set-up (up to unitary or antiunitary freedom) for an important class of states and measurements. This provides us a semi-device-independent way to identify quantum channels from the prepare-and-measure statistics. Lastly, we consider scenarios where we might have some additional information about the channels or additional resources at our disposal which could help us relax some of the assumptions of the proposed scenario.

*Jia-Qi Li,Anton Frisk Kockum,Xin Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A scalable method for generating entangled photon states via cascaded inelastic scattering in a nonlinear waveguide, enabling programmable multi-photon resources for quantum technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of deterministically generating strongly correlated multi-photon states due to weak nonlinearity in optical systems. The proposed method addresses this by offering a scalable and controllable solution.

Method: The method involves cascaded inelastic scattering in a nonlinear waveguide, where a single photon scatters off excited emitters, converting into bound photon pairs (doublons) and further into higher-order states (triplons). The non-local scattering potential is captured using the concept of a pseudo-giant atom.

Result: The result demonstrates unidirectional and fully controllable photon conversion without backscattering, producing a superposition of spatially and temporally isolated photon-number components. This enables on-demand generation of complex multi-photon resources.

Conclusion: This work introduces a scalable architecture for generating correlated few-photon entangled states, leveraging cascaded inelastic scattering and the concept of a pseudo-giant atom. The approach enables programmable multi-photon states, advancing quantum state engineering for applications in quantum simulation, metrology, and scalable quantum networks.

Abstract: Strongly correlated multi-photon states are indispensable resources for advanced quantum technologies, yet their deterministic generation remains challenging due to the inherent weak nonlinearity in most optical systems. Here, we propose a scalable architecture for producing correlated few-photon entangled states via cascaded inelastic scattering in a nonlinear waveguide. When a single photon scatters off a far detuned excited two-level emitter, it coherently converts into a propagating doublon, a bound photon pair with anomalous dispersion. This doublon can subsequently scatter off a downstream excited emitter to further convert into a triplon, and so on, thereby establishing a photon-number amplification cascade $|\cdot \rangle \!\! \rightarrow \!\! |\!\!: \rangle \!\! \rightarrow \! \! |\!\!\therefore \rangle \!\! \to \!\! ...$ Central to this process is the concept of a pseudo-giant atom, which we introduce here to capture the non-local scattering potential emergent from the wave functions of bound states. By implementing this scheme using a real giant atom with multiple engineered coupling points, we achieve unidirectional and full controllable photon conversion without backscattering. The resulting output state forms a programmable superposition of spatially and temporally isolated photon-number components, automatically sorted by their distinct group velocities. This work opens a new paradigm in quantum state engineering, enabling on-demand generation of complex multi-photon resources for quantum simulation, metrology, and scalable quantum networks.

Conclusion: The paper's results demonstrate a significant step towards high-performance quantum computing systems, with speedups ranging from 16.5x to 56.2x.

Abstract: As quantum computers continue to improve and support larger, more complex computations, smart control hardware and compilers are needed to efficiently leverage the capabilities of these systems.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the execution of quantum algorithms on distributed quantum systems. The proposed method involves the development of a hardware design that supports parallel instruction execution and a compiler that modifies the order of instructions to increase parallelism opportunities. The hardware design can be flexibly configured to facilitate parallel execution of instructions that have identical parameters. Furthermore, the compiler uses the underlying hardware constraints to intelligently reorder and decompose instructions to avoid dependencies.
  The compiler, hardware, and their combination are evaluated using a runtime calculator and a benchmark quantum algorithm set. The results demonstrate a significant speedup, achieving a maximum average speedup of 16.5x and a maximum single-benchmark speedup of 56.2x relative to a baseline, serial execution model. Furthermore, we show a speedup can be obtained across all benchmarks using any of the proposed hardware schemes, although the degree of speedup is largely dependent on the type of quantum algorithm. Taken together, the results of this paper represent a significant step towards realizing high-performance quantum computing systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A compiler for diamond NV center quantum computers reduces noise and supports classical instructions, improving execution fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No existing compiler performs translations for diamond NV centers, necessitating a specialized solution to reduce execution times and gate counts.

Method: The compiler translates quantum circuits into diamond NV center-specific instructions, including direct carbon control and partial swaps, and tests outputs in a simulator.

Result: The compiler reduces noise effects through diamond-specific decomposition and successfully performs state tomography and measurement-based operations.

Conclusion: The compiler successfully integrates classical and quantum instructions, improving circuit execution fidelity through diamond-specific optimizations.

Abstract: Advances in quantum algorithms as well as in control hardware designs are continuously being made. These quantum algorithms, expressed as quantum circuits, need to be translated to a set of instructions from a defined quantum instruction-set architecture (ISA), which are executed by the control hardware. These translations can be done by a compiler, targeting different qubit technologies. Specifically for diamond NV centers, no compiler exists to perform this translation. Therefore, in this paper we present a compiler designed for quantum computers utilizing diamond NV center specific instructions, such as direct carbon control and partial swaps, to reduce execution times and gate count. Additionally, our compiler adds on top of general compilers by allowing classical instructions to perform state tomography and measurement-based operations. The output of the compiler is tested in a diamond NV center specific simulator. Comparing a general compiler output with the diamond NV center specific output of our compiler while applying decoherence and depolarization noise showed reduced noise effects due to diamond specific decomposition. The compiler was also tested to perform state tomography and measurement-based operations, which showed to be functional. Our results show that we have successfully created a compiler with integrated classical and quantum instructions support, which can improve circuit execution fidelity by utilizing diamond specific optimizations.

Conclusion: The paper reviews the use of quantum coherence in photosynthesis and avian navigation, highlighting advances in theoretical methods, quantum simulation, and applications in designing efficient energy transport devices and navigation technologies.

Abstract: Many living organisms can exploit quantum mechanical effects to gain distinct biological advantages. In plants, photosynthesis uses quantum coherence to achieve near 100% efficiency in energy transfer. With advances in experimental techniques, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy can reveal dynamic processes such as coherence and coupling within a system, and it plays an important role in studying energy transfer in photosynthesis. On the theory side, methods such as the generalized Bloch-Redfield theory and the hierarchical equations of motion are used to model photosynthetic systems. Quantum simulation, as a high-efficiency and low-complexity approach, has also made progress across various platforms in the study of photosynthesis. In recent years, a series of studies has introduced quantum coherence into artificial systems to enhance energy transfer efficiency, laying the groundwork for the design of coherent devices with efficient energy transport. Birds can use the weak geomagnetic field and spin-dependent chemical reactions to detect direction. Theoretical frameworks for animal navigation include magnetite-based mechanisms, magnetoreceptor genes, and the radical-pair mechanism. Quantum simulations of navigation have also advanced on multiple platforms. Inspired by animal navigation, diverse quantum effects have been applied to improve sensing and to support navigation tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive review of progress on quantum coherence in photosynthesis and avian navigation, along with related theoretical methods, quantum simulation approaches, and research on quantum coherent devices.

Abstract: We demonstrate a method for generating entanglement between trapped atomic ions based on adiabatically ramped state-dependent forces. By ramping both the amplitude of the state-dependent force and the motional mode frequencies, we realize an entangling operation that is robust to motional mode occupation and drifts in the mode frequencies. We measure Bell state fidelities above 0.99 across a broad range of ramp parameters and with motional occupations up to 10 phonons. This technique enables high-fidelity entangling operations without ground-state cooling, has a reduced calibration overhead, and is well suited for both quantum logic spectroscopy applications and scalable quantum computing architectures.

TL;DR: Quantum algorithm for Lasserre's hierarchy values outperforms classical methods in polynomial optimization, with significant runtime improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the efficiency of approximating Lasserre's hierarchy values for polynomial optimization, addressing the limitations of classical methods which scale poorly with problem dimension.

Method: The method involves a quantum algorithm based on matrix multiplicative weights, with runtime scaling as O(n^kε^(-4) + n^(k/2)ε^(-5)) for fixed k, and includes a block encoding implementation without QRAM.

Result: The results show a quantum speedup, with examples like portfolio optimization achieving O(nε^(-4) + √nε^(-5)), improving over classical O(n^(ω+1)log(1/ε)) bounds.

Conclusion: The paper presents a quantum algorithm for approximating Lasserre's hierarchy values with super-quadratic speedup over classical methods, particularly in polynomial optimization problems like portfolio optimization.

Abstract: We study quantum algorithms for approximating Lasserre's hierarchy values for polynomial optimization. Let $f,g_1,\ldots,g_m$ be real polynomials in $n$ variables and $f^\star$ the infimum of $f$ over the semialgebraic set $S(g)=\{x: g_i(x)\ge 0\}$. Let $λ_k$ be the value of the order-$k$ Lasserre relaxation. Assume either (i) $f^\star=λ_k$ and the optimum is attained in the $\ell_1$-ball of radius $1/2$, or (ii) $S(g)$ lies in the simplex $\{x\ge 0: \sum_j x_j\le 1/2\}$, and the constraints define this simplex. After an appropriate coefficient rescaling, we give a quantum algorithm based on matrix multiplicative weights that approximates $λ_k$ to accuracy $\varepsilon>0$ with runtime, for fixed $k$, \[ O(n^k\varepsilon^{-4}+n^{k/2}\varepsilon^{-5}),\qquad O\!\left(s_g\!\left[n^k\varepsilon^{-4}+\!\left(n^{k}+\!\sum_{i=1}^m n^{k-d_i}\right)^{1/2}\!\varepsilon^{-5}\right]\right), \] where $s_g$ bounds the sparsity of the coefficient-matching matrices associated with the constraints. Classical matrix multiplicative-weights methods scale as $O(n^{3k}\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$ even in the unconstrained case. As an example, we obtain an $O(n\varepsilon^{-4}+\sqrt{n}\varepsilon^{-5})$ quantum algorithm for portfolio optimization, improving over the classical $O(n^{ω+1}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ bound with $ω\approx2.373$.
  Our approach builds on and sharpens the analysis of Apeldoorn and Gilyén for the SDPs arising in polynomial optimization. We also show how to implement the required block encodings without QRAM. Under the stated assumptions, our method achieves a super-quadratic speedup in the problem dimension for computing Lasserre relaxations.

Conclusion: The lecture notes provide a comprehensive introduction to information scrambling, linking quantum chaos, information dynamics, and quantum computing. They highlight the universal features of quantum chaos and the practical applications in quantum-device benchmarking.

Abstract: Information scrambling, the process by which quantum information spreads and becomes effectively inaccessible, is central to modern quantum statistical physics and quantum chaos. These lecture notes provide an introduction to information scrambling from both static and dynamical perspectives. The spectral properties of reduced density matrices arising from Haar-random states are developed through the geometry of the unitary group and the universal results of random matrix theory. This geometric framework yields universal, model-independent predictions for entanglement and spectral statistics, capturing generic features of quantum chaos without reference to microscopic details. Dynamical diagnostics such as the spectral form factor and out-of-time-ordered correlators further reveal the onset of chaos in time-dependent evolution.
  The notes are aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students in physics, mathematics, and computer science who are interested in the connections between quantum chaos, information dynamics, and quantum computing. Concepts such as entanglement growth, Haar randomness, random-matrix statistics, and unitary t-designs are introduced through their realization in random quantum circuits and circuit complexity. The same mathematical framework also underpins modern quantum-device benchmarking, where approximate unitary designs and random circuits translate geometric ideas into quantitative tools for assessing fidelity, noise, and scrambling efficiency in real quantum processors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDE-constrained optimization is computationally demanding due to the need for repeated PDE solving within an optimization process. Existing methods face challenges like prohibitive readout overhead, which cancel potential quantum speedups.

Method: Proposes a fully coherent quantum algorithm combining a quantum PDE solver and a quantum optimizer with oracle access to a quantized objective function. The method avoids classical access to the full solution by using block-encoding for the objective function.

Result: The proposed method avoids quantum state tomography, preserving quantum speedups inherited from the underlying quantum PDE solver. Numerical demonstrations in applications like the Black-Scholes equation and wave equation validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work presents a concept of composing quantum subroutines to neutralize the weakness of one with the strength of another, aiming for a bottleneck-free quantum algorithm. Numerical demonstrations validate the proposed method in practical applications.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization, where an optimization problem is subject to PDE constraints, arises in various applications such as design, control, and inference. Solving such problems is computationally demanding because it requires repeatedly solving a PDE and using its solution within an optimization process. In this paper, we first propose a fully coherent quantum algorithm for solving PDE-constrained optimization problems. The proposed method combines a quantum PDE solver that prepares the solution vector as a quantum state, and a quantum optimizer that assumes oracle access to a quantized objective function. The central idea is the explicit construction of the oracle in a form of block-encoding for the objective function, which coherently uses the output of a quantum PDE solver. This enables us to avoid classical access to the full solution that requires quantum state tomography canceling out the potential quantum speedups. We also derive the overall computational complexity of the proposed method with respect to parameters for optimization and PDE simulation, where quantum speedup is inherited from the underlying quantum PDE solver. We numerically demonstrate the validity of the proposed method by applications, including a parameter calibration problem in the Black-Scholes equation and a material parameter design problem in the wave equation. This work presents the concept of composing quantum subroutines so that the weakness of one (i.e., prohibitive readout overhead) is neutralized by the strength of another (i.e., coherent oracle access), toward a bottleneck-free quantum algorithm.

Abstract: The Dirac delta function potential is considered within the real Hilbert space approach for complex wave functions, as well as quaternionic wave functions. As has been previously determined, the real Hilbert space approach enables the possibility of self-interacting physical systems.

Motivation: To develop a scalable and experimentally feasible approach for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions using hybrid discrete-continuous quantum systems.

Method: A hybrid qubit-qumode framework is developed, where fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits and U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes. Two constraint-enforcement strategies are compared: a squeezing-based projection and a penalty Hamiltonian approach.

Result: The framework reproduces gauge-invariant dynamics and demonstrates ground-state preparation and convergence using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm.

Conclusion: The hybrid qubit-qumode framework successfully reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route for simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures.

Abstract: We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.

TL;DR: High-energy Kapitza-Dirac effect observed in SEM, enabling coherent electron manipulation for microscopy applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous observations of the Kapitza-Dirac effect were limited to low-energy electrons due to the negligible momentum impact of visible photons on high-energy electrons. This study explores the effect with high-energy electrons.

Method: Observation of the Kapitza-Dirac effect using high-energy (20 keV and 30 keV) electrons in a scanning electron microscope, with photon sidebands detected via spatial filtering.

Result: Photon sidebands in the electron transverse momentum spectrum were observed, showing coherent, reversible oscillations as the electron-light field coupling strength increased.

Conclusion: The Kapitza-Dirac effect serves as a promising tool for coherent electron beam manipulation in electron microscopy applications, potentially functioning as a beam-splitter or phase-plate.

Abstract: Electron matter waves coherently diffract when passing through a periodic structure of light formed by two interfering light waves. In this so-called Kapitza-Dirac effect, the electron momentum changes due to absorption and emission of photons via stimulated Compton scattering. Until now, the effect has only been observed with low energy electrons due to the small momentum of a visible photon compared to the momentum of high energy electron leading to diffraction angles of 10^(-4) rad or smaller. We report on the observation of the Kapitza-Dirac effect in a scanning electron microscope using high energy (20 keV and 30 keV) electrons with de-Broglie wavelengths of 9 pm and 7 pm, respectively. The photon sidebands in the electron transverse momentum spectrum are detected in the convergent beam diffraction geometry using spatial filtering. As the coupling strength between the electrons and the light field increases, the sideband populations exhibit coherent, reversible oscillations among diffraction orders. The effect can serve as a coherent electron beam-splitter or a phase-plate in various types of electron microscopes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the additional computational cost of Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNG) and leverage the structure of the Hamiltonian for more efficient optimization.

Method: Proposes Hamiltonian-aware Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (H-QNG) by using the Riemannian pullback metric from the Hamiltonian subspace to the parameter space.

Result: H-QNG achieves faster convergence to chemical accuracy with fewer quantum computational resources compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: H-QNG combines the low computational cost of VG and the reparameterization-invariance of QNG, achieving faster convergence and requiring fewer quantum resources, as demonstrated in numerical experiments on molecular Hamiltonians.

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising algorithms for current quantum devices. It employs a classical optimizer to iteratively update the parameters of a variational quantum circuit in order to search for the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. The efficacy of VQEs largely depends on the optimizer employed. Recent studies suggest that Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNG) can achieve faster convergence than vanilla gradient descent (VG), but at the cost of additional quantum resources to estimate Fubini-Study metric tensor in each optimization step. The Fubini-Study metric tensor used in QNG is related to the entire quantum state space and does not incorporate information about the target Hamiltonian. To take advantage of the structure of the Hamiltonian and address the limitation of additional computational cost in QNG, we propose Hamiltonian-aware Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (H-QNG). In H-QNG, we propose to use the Riemannian pullback metric induced from the lower-dimensional subspace spanned by the Hamiltonian terms onto the parameter space. We show that H-QNG inherits the desirable features of both approaches: the low quantum computational cost of VG and the reparameterization-invariance of QNG. We also validate its performance through numerical experiments on molecular Hamiltonians, showing that H-QNG achieves faster convergence to chemical accuracy while requiring fewer quantum computational resources.

TL;DR: Chiral quantum walks improve protein-protein interaction prediction by adding random phases, enhancing robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the predictive power of quantum walk-based approaches for reconstructing protein-protein interaction networks by addressing the dependency on optimal evolution time.

Method: The study introduces chirality by adding random phases to Hamiltonian generators, enabling a more diverse network exploration through a swarm of chiral quantum walks.

Result: The chiral quantum walk algorithm exhibits greater robustness and retains high predictive accuracy, especially in comparisons between evolving databases.

Conclusion: Chiral quantum walks demonstrate superior robustness and performance in predicting protein-protein interaction networks, outperforming both classical and non-chiral quantum methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing protein-protein interaction networks is a central challenge in network medicine, often addressed using link prediction algorithms. Recent studies suggest that quantum walk-based approaches hold promise for this task. In this paper, we build on these algorithms by introducing chirality through the addition of random phases in the Hamiltonian generators. The resulting additional degrees of freedom enable a more diverse exploration of the network, which we exploit by employing a swarm of chiral quantum walks. Thus, we enhance the predictive power of quantum walks on complex networks. Indeed, compared to a non-chiral algorithm, the chiral version exhibits greater robustness, making its performance less dependent on the optimal evolution time--a critical hyperparameter of the non-chiral model. This improvement arises from complementary dynamics introduced by chirality within the swarm. By analyzing multiple phase-sampling strategies, we identify configurations that achieve a practical trade-off: retaining the high predictive accuracy of the non-chiral algorithm at its optimal time while gaining the robustness typical of chirality. Our findings highlight the versatility of chiral quantum walks and their potential to outperform both classical and non-chiral quantum methods in realistic scenarios, including comparisons between successive versions of evolving databases.

Motivation: The study aims to extend the J-matrix method to nonlinear scenarios, specifically for the time-independent nonlinear Schrödinger equation in two dimensions with circular symmetry.

Method: The method involves a perturbative formulation based on the linearization of orthogonal polynomials and the use of the J-matrix method, with numerical implementation supported by Gauss quadrature integral approximation.

Result: Results include the scattering matrix for the nonlinear Schrödinger equation with cubic and quintic nonlinearities, and the identification of bifurcation phenomena at specific energy values.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with the observation of bifurcation phenomena at certain energy levels, highlighting the manifestation of nonlinearity in the system.

Abstract: We introduce a perturbative formulation for a nonlinear extension of the J-matrix method of scattering in two dimensions. That is, we obtain the scattering matrix for the time-independent nonlinear Schrödinger equation in two dimensions with circular symmetry. The formulation relies on the linearization of products of orthogonal polynomials and on the utilization of the tools of the J-matrix method. Gauss quadrature integral approximation is instrumental in the numerical implementation of the approach. We present the theory for a general ψ^{2n + 1} nonlinearity, where n is a natural number, and obtain results for the cubic and quintic nonlinearities, ψ^3 and ψ^5. At certain value(s) of the energy, we observe the occurrence of bifurcation with two stable solutions. This curious and interesting phenomenon is a clear signature and manifestation of the underlying nonlinearity.

Motivation: To explore systems where the number of spatial dimensions is a quantum variable, uncovering enhanced symmetries and temperature-dependent dimensionality.

Method: Proposing quantum-mechanical systems with dynamical spatial dimensions, analyzing a harmonic oscillator as an example, and evaluating its partition function.

Result: Demonstrated a temperature-dependent effective dimension via the partition function of a quantum harmonic oscillator.

Conclusion: The framework introduces a novel approach to physical systems by making spatial dimensions a dynamical quantum variable, opening applications in gravity and condensed matter.

Abstract: We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable. As a consequence, the effective dimension depends on the physical state of the system. Interestingly, systems of this form exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a harmonic oscillator for which the spatial dimension is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.

Motivation: The study aims to explore the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), a quantum coherence-driven phenomenon that can accelerate relaxation processes, and its potential applications in improving quantum thermal tasks.

Method: The research involves experimental investigation of the QME in a spin-1/2 system interacting with a heat sink. The study also applies the QME in a quantum Otto refrigerator to observe its impact on cooling efficiency.

Result: The experiment confirms the existence of the QME, showing that a system can thermalize faster from an initially farther-from-equilibrium state. Additionally, the QME is successfully applied to enhance the cooling power of a quantum Otto refrigerator.

Conclusion: This study successfully demonstrates the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) and its potential application in enhancing quantum thermal tasks, specifically the cooling power of a quantum Otto refrigerator. The findings open new practical avenues for optimizing quantum thermal processes.

Abstract: Coherence is an inherently quantum property that deeply affects microscopic processes, including thermalization phenomena. A striking example is the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), in which a system can exhibit anomalous relaxation, thermalizing faster from a state initially farther from equilibrium than from one closer. Here, we experimentally investigate the genuine QME and observe how the dynamics of a spin-1/2 system interacting with a heat sink can be sped-up to equilibrium. Furthermore, we apply the QME in a quantum Otto refrigerator, thereby increasing its cooling power. This proof-of-concept experiment unveils new practical paths for improving quantum thermal tasks.

Motivation: To improve the efficiency and fidelity of quantum detector tomography (QDT) for phase-insensitive detectors, and explore its extension to phase-sensitive cases.

Conclusion: The proposed gradient descent-based optimization technique for QDT achieves higher or comparable fidelity than CCO in less time, even with noise and limited resources. The method also extends to phase-sensitive detectors via Stiefel manifold parametrization.

Abstract: We present a technique for performing quantum detector tomography (QDT) of phase insensitive quantum detectors using gradient descent-based optimization to learn the positive operator-valued measure (POVM) that best describes the data collected using the detector under study. We numerically benchmark our method against constrained convex optimization (CCO) and show that it reaches higher or comparable reconstruction fidelity in much less time even in the presence of noise and limited probe state resources. We also present a possible extension of our approach to the phase sensitive case via a parametrization of POVMs on the complex Stiefel manifold which enables gradient based optimization restricted to this manifold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of understanding of logical operators and boundary behavior in tile codes compared to surface codes, and to explore their potential for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Method: The research employs a combination of theoretical proofs, algebraic and algebro-geometric frameworks, and the introduction of derived automorphisms to analyze tile codes.

Result: A canonical symplectic basis of logical operators for tile codes is established, along with algebraic frameworks and the concept of derived automorphisms, demonstrating practical applications for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Conclusion: The study provides a detailed framework for understanding tile codes, including logical operators, algebraic structures, and the concept of derived automorphisms, supporting their potential as building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: The recently introduced tile codes are a promising alternative to surface codes, combining two-dimensional locality with higher encoding efficiency. While surface codes are well understood in terms of their logical operators and boundary behavior, much less is known about tile codes. In this work, we establish a natural and precise description of their logical operator space. We prove that, under mild assumptions, any tile code admits a canonical symplectic basis of logical operators supported along lattice boundaries, which can be generated efficiently by a simple cellular automaton with the number of update rules only depending on the non-locality of the tile code. Further, we develop algebraic and algebro-geometric frameworks for tile codes, by resolving them by translationally invariant Pauli stabilizer models and showing that they arise as derived sections of a Koszul complex on $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$. Finally, we introduce the concept of derived automorphisms for quantum codes. These are automorphism-like operations that can exist even for codes that do not have symmetries. We explain how derived automorphisms can be implemented for tile codes in a low-overhead and fault-tolerant manner by extending the lattice on one side and shrinking it on the other. While this operation is trivial for the surface code, it induces a product of logical CNOT gates on the encoded information. Our results provide new structural insights into tile codes and lay the groundwork for tile codes as building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

TL;DR: 论文证明在特定几何条件下，VQE的全局优化复杂度与低曲率维度r相关，而非参数空间维度p，支持噪声环境下的高概率优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究变分量子本征求解器在噪声环境下的全局优化可行性，为量子计算中的高概率优化问题提供理论支持。

Method: 基于周期性ansatz和有界生成器的几何条件，假设低能区域为满足多项式纤维正则性的Morse--Bott子流形，其法向Hessian秩r为O(log p)。通过分析低曲率维结构，推导出样本复杂度的理论界限。

Result: 样本复杂度在曲率维度r上呈准多项式关系（与p和ε^{-1}有关），在δ^{-1}上呈对数关系。算法输出区域内的所有点均为ε最优，且至少有一个点在全局最小值的邻域内。

Conclusion: 证明了在特定几何条件下，变分量子本征求解器（VQE）在全局ε最优性方面具有噪声鲁棒性和概率近似正确（PAC）保证。样本复杂度与曲率维度r有关，而非环境维度p，使得高概率全局优化在噪声环境下仍可行。

Abstract: We give noise-robust, Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) guarantees of global $\varepsilon$-optimality for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver under explicit geometric conditions. For periodic ansatzes with bounded generators -- yielding a globally Lipschitz cost landscape on a toroidal parameter space -- we assume that the low-energy region containing the global minimum is a Morse--Bott submanifold whose normal Hessian has rank $r = O(\log p)$ for $p$ parameters, and which satisfies polynomial fiber regularity with respect to coordinate-aligned, embedded flats. This low-curvature-dimensional structure serves as a model for regimes in which only a small number of directions control energy variation, and is consistent with mechanisms such as strong parameter tying together with locality in specific multiscale and tied shallow architectures.
  Under this assumption, the sample complexity required to find an $\varepsilon$-optimal region with confidence $1-δ$ scales with the curvature dimension $r$ rather than the ambient dimension $p$. With probability at least $1-δ$, the algorithm outputs a region in which all points are $\varepsilon$-optimal, and at least one lies within a bounded neighborhood of the global minimum. The resulting complexity is quasi-polynomial in $p$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and logarithmic in $δ^{-1}$. This identifies a geometric regime in which high-probability global optimization remains feasible despite shot noise.

Abstract: This paper introduces the DIRSH algorithm for the Qubit Routing Problem (QRP), using a heuristic-guided randomized divide-and-conquer strategy. The method splits the circuit into chunks and optimizes each one with a stochastic selection of gates and swaps. It balances global search, via restarts and adaptive tuning of bandit parameters with depth-sensitive local pruning. Tested on RevLib benchmarks mapped to the 20-qubit IBMQ Tokyo topology, DIRSH outperformed three LightSABRE variants across different time budgets, achieving shorter depths and fewer swaps. These results confirm that combining chunk-based decomposition with bandit-driven heuristics is effective for routing quantum circuits on NISQ devices.

Motivation: To explore and elucidate the role of quantum entanglement in quantum information theory, specifically through mathematical methods and practical applications.

Method: The paper employs the Schmidt decomposition as a mathematical tool to determine quantum entanglement and demonstrates its application through the example of quantum teleportation.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrates how the Schmidt decomposition can identify entanglement and showcases quantum teleportation as a practical example of entanglement's utility.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the significance of quantum entanglement in quantum information theory, demonstrating its mathematical underpinning through the Schmidt decomposition and its practical application in quantum teleportation. It also suggests potential extensions of the Schmidt decomposition for broader uses.

Abstract: Quantum information theory is a rapidly growing area of math and physics that combines two independent theories, quantum mechanics and information theory. Quantum entanglement is a concept that was first proposed in the EPR paradox. In quantum mechanics, particles can be in superposition, meaning they are in multiple different states at once. It is not until the particle is measured that it is forced into a single state. However, it is possible that particles can be tied to other particles, meaning that the measurement of one particle will determine the measurement of the other particle. Entanglement is at the very core of quantum information theory. It is one of the core pieces that allows for the massive increase in computing power. For this paper, we decided to focus on demonstrating the mathematical method (the Schmidt decomposition) for determining if a system is entangled, and a demonstration of quantum entanglement's use (quantum teleportation) as well as a quick look at how to extend the uses of the Schmidt decomposition.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effects of torsion and an Aharonov--Bohm flux on the behavior of a confined electron, with a focus on optical transitions and pseudospin states, and their potential applications in technology.

Method: The study analyzes the behavior of a single electron confined in a uniform-torsion medium under a perpendicular magnetic field and an Aharonov--Bohm flux. Exact spectrum and wave functions are used to derive results.

Result: Findings include a torsion-controlled optical transition with programmable switching, an Aharonov--Bohm-tunable angular pseudospin, and a linear torsion dependence for nanoscale metrology. Torsion also provides in situ control in cavity QED.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that torsion, as a geometric/topological parameter, offers significant control over optical transitions and light-matter interactions, with applications in programmable optical switching, selective optical addressability, and nanoscale torsion metrology, as well as potential uses in cavity QED.

Abstract: We study a single electron confined in a uniform-torsion medium, a continuum model of a screw dislocation density, in a perpendicular magnetic field, and in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm flux. Torsion alone produces radial confinement without any \textit{ad hoc} potential, while the Aharonov--Bohm phase breaks the usual $m\leftrightarrow -m$ symmetry. From the exact spectrum and wave functions, we find: (i) a torsion-controlled optical transition whose energy blue-shifts from $\sim 6.8$ to $\sim 15.5$~meV and whose saturation intensity varies by an order of magnitude, enabling geometry-programmable optical switching; (ii) an Aharonov--Bohm-tunable ``angular pseudospin'' formed by the $m=\pm1$ states, with flux-controlled level splitting and asymmetric oscillator strengths that allow selective optical addressability; and (iii) an approximately linear torsion dependence of the transition energy that enables nanoscale torsion metrology with an estimated resolution of $\sim 10^{5}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. In this context, ``torsion'' refers to the experimentally relevant continuum limit of a uniform density of parallel screw dislocations, i.e., a crystal with finite torsion but vanishing curvature, which can, in practice, be engineered and probed in twisted nanowires and strained semiconductor heterostructures. We also show how torsion provides \textit{in situ} control of emitter--cavity detuning and light--matter coupling in cavity QED, in direct analogy with strain tuning of semiconductor quantum dots in nanocavities, but here arising from a purely geometric/topological parameter.

Result: Successfully synthesized CrOCl monolayers and nanosheets with excellent air stability, tunable morphology, and a Néel temperature of ~14 K.

Conclusion: The study provides a reliable method for synthesizing two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials, specifically CrOCl, with tunable morphology and high crystalline quality, supported by theoretical calculations.

Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional magnetic materials has provided an ideal platform for exploring physical phenomena in the two-dimensional limit. However, intrinsic two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials have been rarely reported, limiting systematic studies of their electronic properties. The discovery of novel intrinsic two-dimensional antiferromagnets and the development of robust synthesis strategies, therefore, remain significant challenges. Here, we report the chemical vapor deposition synthesis of CrOCl monolayer films and nanosheets that exhibit excellent air stability. The CrOCl morphology is tunable, ranging from two-dimensional nanosheets to three-dimensional flower-like structures, with lateral sizes ranging from several microns to continuous monolayer films. Structural characterization confirms the materials composition and high crystalline quality. Furthermore, magnetic measurements, supported by theoretical calculations, reveal a Néel temperature for CrOCl of ~14 K. This work provides a reliable route for preparing two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The V-shaped geometry's apex angle (θ≈0.6π) maximizes nonmagnetic magnetoelectric effects via spin–orbit interaction, while magnetic effects arise from Zeeman coupling. Findings highlight shape-dependent multipole mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the shape dependence and microscopic mechanism of the magnetoelectric effect in a V-shaped one-dimensional chain model, including nonmagnetic and magnetic origins.

Method: The study employs numerical calculations based on the Kubo formula, constructs a low-energy effective Hamiltonian projected onto the s-orbital subspace, and uses multipole-basis representation to identify selection rules.

Result: Nonmagnetic-driven magnetoelectric response peaks at θ≈0.6π due to an effective spin–orbit interaction induced by V-shaped geometry. Analytical and numerical results agree. Magnetic-driven response originates from spin magnetization induced by coupling between electric-field–driven charge-potential gradient and Zeeman term.

Conclusion: The V-shaped geometry induces distinct magnetoelectric mechanisms depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry, providing a framework for understanding shape-induced multipole phenomena in mesoscopic and bulk systems.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the shape dependence and microscopic mechanism of the magnetoelectric effect, including both nonmagnetic (Edelstein-type) and magnetic origins, in a V-shaped one-dimensional chain model. Numerical calculations based on the Kubo formula reveal that the magnitude of the nonmagnetic-driven magnetoelectric response reaches a maximum at an apex angle of $θ\approx 0.6π$. To clarify the microscopic origin of this behavior, we construct a low-energy effective Hamiltonian by projecting onto the $s$-orbital subspace and demonstrate that the polarity induced by the V-shaped geometry manifests as an effective spin--orbit interaction. An analytical derivation of the Green's function shows that the geometric effect appears as a $T$-matrix contribution, reflecting the local breaking of translational symmetry at the V-shaped edge. Furthermore, by employing a multipole-basis representation, we identify the selection rules that govern the magnetoelectric tensor and reveal that the coupling between the effective spin--orbit interaction and the orbital angular momentum generated across the apex plays an essential role. The resulting angular dependence, $\sinθ\sin{θ/2}$, peaks at $θ= 2\tan^{-1}\sqrt{2} \approx 0.608π$, in good agreement with the numerical results. We also analyze a ferromagnetic V-shaped model including the Zeeman interaction and show that the magnetic-driven magnetoelectric response originates from the spin magnetization induced by the coupling between the electric-field--driven charge-potential gradient and the Zeeman term. These findings demonstrate that the V-shaped geometry gives rise to distinct magnetoelectric mechanisms depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry and provide a microscopic framework for understanding shape-induced multipole phenomena in mesoscopic and bulk systems.

Abstract: The low-temperature isochoric heat capacity of cryocrystals was scaled using the universal scaling function. This universality links the magnitude of the anomaly and the characteristic temperature of the hump $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ in heat capacity, which is related to the first van Hove singularity in the phonon spectrum. For atomic, molecular, and quantum cryocrystals, $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ systematically shifts with molar volume, reflecting Brillouin zone scaling and revealing a common vibrational origin. These findings for the scaling function bridge thermodynamics with the vibrational density of states, highlighting fundamental universality in lattice dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the possibility of achieving spin polarization in antiferromagnetic materials without an applied electric field, extending previous research on electric field-induced effects.

Method: The study uses a tight-binding antiferromagnetic helix model with non-uniform magnetic moments, employing the Greens formalism to compute results under various conditions.

Result: High degrees of spin polarization are observed in both correlated and uncorrelated non-uniform magnetic moment configurations, validating the approach for a broad range of physical parameters.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that spin polarization can be achieved in antiferromagnetic materials without an electric field, opening new possibilities for spin selectivity in systems with zero net magnetization.

Abstract: The occurrence of a finite mismatch between the up and down spin energy channels due to the application of an electric field, leading to the generation of a polarized spin current from an unpolarized beam in antiferromagnetic materials, has already been established. But, in this work, we report for the first time that even in the absence of any electric field, spin polarization can be achieved. We choose a tight-binding antiferromagnetic helix, where the strengths of magnetic moments at different lattice sites are non-uniform. The non-uniformity is introduced in two distinct forms, correlated and uncorrelated, and in each case we find a high degree of spin polarization. The Greens formalism is used to compute the results under various input conditions, and the results are valid for a broad range of physical parameters. Our analysis can open up a new direction of getting spin selectivity in different magnetic systems with zero net magnetization, in the absence of an electric field.

Motivation: To investigate the emergence of a quantum spin Hall (QSH) or insulating phase in ultrathin (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ films when the thickness is comparable to the surface state penetration depth.

Method: Fabrication of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ Hall bars with 6 and 9 nm thicknesses, followed by low-temperature transport measurements to observe the insulating phase indicative of a hybridization gap.

Result: An insulating phase around the Dirac point was observed in 6 nm films at low temperatures, indicating a hybridization gap, but the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field remains unclear.

Conclusion: The study highlights progress towards realizing the quantum spin Hall state in ultrathin (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ films but identifies unresolved questions about transport measurements under a perpendicular magnetic field.

Abstract: We study the three-dimensional topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ in its ultrathin limit i.e. when the thickness is of the same order as the surface state penetration depth. It is expected that in this limit a hybridization gap opens at the Dirac point, which gives rise to a quantum spin Hall (QSH) or insulating phase, depending on the material thickness. We fabricate (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ Hall bars with a thicknesses of 6 and 9 nm and measure an insulating phase around the Dirac point for low bias and at sub-Kelvin temperatures only in samples fabricated from the 6 nm films, which indicates the presence of a hybridization gap. The effect of a perpendicular magnetic field on the hybridization gap is studied but remains partially unresolved. The results form an important step towards experimentally realizing the quantum spin Hall state via hybridization in ultrathin films of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, yet, they also expose a knowledge gap regarding transport measurements in these systems.

Motivation: To investigate nonequilibrium charge transport in a trimer molecular transistor with electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, and understand their effects on transport properties.

Method: The system is modeled using an extended Anderson-Holstein-Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian. Electron-phonon interaction is treated nonperturbatively via Lang-Firsov transformation, while electron-electron interaction is incorporated at the mean-field level. Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function framework is employed for transport analysis.

Result: The formalism successfully calculates the spectral function, tunneling current, and differential conductance of the trimer molecular transistor.

Conclusion: The study systematically evaluates the impact of Coulomb interaction, electron-phonon coupling, and dissipation on the electronic transport properties of a trimer molecular transistor.

Abstract: Nonequilibrium charge transport through a trimer molecular transistor composed of three quantum dots arranged in a triangular geometry, which is placed on a substrate, has been studied in the presence of electron electron and electron phonon interactions. The entire system is described by an extended Anderson Holstein Caldeira Leggett Hamiltonian, in which the Caldeira Leggett term accounts for phonon damping arising from the coupling between the molecular vibrations and the substrate phonon bath. The electron phonon interaction is treated nonperturbatively using the Lang Firsov canonical transformation, while the electron electron interaction is incorporated at the mean field level. Keldysh nonequilibrium Greens function framework is used to study the transport properties, allowing us to calculate the spectral function, tunneling current, ad differential conductance of the trimer molecular transistor. The formalism enables systematic evaluation of the effects of Coulomb interaction, electron phonon coupling, and dissipation on the devices electronic transport characteristics.

Abstract: Nanoscale conductors are interesting for thermoelectrics because of their particular spectral features connecting separated heat and particle currents. Multiterminal devices in the quantum regime benefit from phase-coherent phenomena, which turns the thermoelectric effect nonlocal, and from tunable single-particle interactions. This way one can define quantum thermocouples which convert an injected heat current into useful power in an isothermal conductor, or work as refrigerators. Additionally, efficient heat management devices can be defined. We review recent theoretical and experimental progress in the research of multiterminal thermal and thermoelectric quantum transport leading to proposals of autonomous quantum heat engines and thermal devices.
