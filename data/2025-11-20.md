TL;DR: Using bare superconducting loops in 2D SQUID arrays eliminates the need for incommensurate loop areas, enabling absolute magnetometry and improving quantum sensor performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D SQUID arrays require incommensurate loop areas for absolute magnetometry, limiting their quantum performance. The goal is to overcome this constraint by introducing a synthetic area spread via bare superconducting loops.

Method: By selectively inserting bare sections of superconducting circuits without Josephson junctions and generalizing current theories, a synthetic area spread is analytically formulated. Multiple 2D SQUID arrays with bare loops are fabricated and tested to validate the theory.

Result: The synthetic area spread achieved through bare loops allows 2D SQUID arrays to function as absolute magnetometers without physical area spread. Experimental results align with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that incorporating bare superconducting loops in 2D SQUID arrays enables them to function as absolute magnetometers without requiring incommensurate loop areas, thus optimizing quantum-limited performance. This approach is experimentally validated and opens new possibilities for ultra-high-performance quantum sensors.

Abstract: Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs), formed by incorporating Josephson junctions into loops of superconducting material, are the backbone of many modern quantum sensing systems. It has been demonstrated that, by combining multiple SQUID loops into a two-dimensional (2D) array, it is possible to fabricate ultra-high-performing Radio frequency sensors. However, to function as absolute magnetometers, current-in-use arrays require the area of each SQUID loop in the array to be incommensurate and, in turn, forbid the achievement of their full potential in terms of quantum-limited performances. This is because imposing incommensurability in the areas contrasts with optimised performance in each single SQUID loop. In this work, we report that by selectively inserting bare sections of a superconducting circuit with no Josephson junctions, 2D SQUID arrays can operate as an absolute magnetometer even when no physical area spread is applied. Based on a generalisation of current available theories, a complete analytical formulation for the one-to-one correspondence between the distribution of these bare loops and what we call a synthetic area spread is unveiled. This synthetic spread represents the equivalent physical spread of incommensurate SQUID loops that you will use to obtain the absolute Voltage-Magnetic Flux response if no bare loops were in use. Our work opens the way to a broader use of this technology for the fabrication of ultra-high-performance absolute quantum sensors. Our approach is also experimentally verified by fabricating several 2D SQUID arrays incorporating bare superconducting loops and by demonstrating that they behave in alignment with what is suggested by our theory.

TL;DR: Comparison of Nb3Sn films by different fabrication methods reveals distinct rf vortex nucleation behaviors, with electrochemical films showing additional temperature-dependent structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare rf vortex nucleation in Nb3Sn films fabricated by different methods and understand the influence of fabrication on their superconducting properties.

Method: A near-field magnetic microwave microscope was used to investigate rf vortex nucleation in two SRF-quality Nb3Sn films fabricated differently: one by conventional vapor-diffusion and the other by electrochemical plating followed by thermal annealing. The microscope applied a localized rf magnetic field and measured the third-harmonic response (P3f).

Result: Both films showed nontrivial P3f(T) structures below 7 K, indicating rf vortex nucleation. The electrochemical film displayed additional P3f(T) structures between 14 K and 16 K, absent in the vapor-diffused sample.

Conclusion: The study highlights the impact of fabrication methods on rf vortex penetration properties and demonstrates the utility of third-harmonic response as a tool for detecting surface defects in Nb3Sn films.

Abstract: We use a near-field magnetic microwave microscope to investigate and compare rf vortex nucleation in two superconducting radio-frequency (SRF)-quality Nb3Sn films fabricated by different methods: a conventional vapor-diffused film and an electrochemically plated film followed by thermal annealing, both of which are deposited on Nb substrates. The microscope applies a localized rf magnetic field to the sample surface and measures the resulting third-harmonic response P3f, which is particularly sensitive to rf vortex nucleation triggered by surface defects. Both Nb3Sn films exhibit nontrivial P3f(T) structures below 7 K that display the key signatures associated with rf vortex nucleation at local defects. The electrochemical film additionally shows multiple P3f(T) structures between 14 K and 16 K that are absent in the vapor-diffused sample. Our results highlight the influence of fabrication method on rf vortex penetration properties and demonstrate the utility of third-harmonic response as a local diagnostic tool for surface defects in Nb3Sn films.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The precise crystal structure of La3Ni2O7 in its high-pressure superconducting state has been a subject of intense debate, with proposed models including both orthorhombic and tetragonal symmetries.

Method: High-pressure Raman spectroscopy combined with first-principles calculations were used to investigate the structural evolution of La3Ni2O7 under pressure up to 32.7 GPa.

Result: A clear structural transition sequence was identified: from the orthorhombic Amam phase to a mixed Amam+Fmmm phase at 4 GPa, followed by a complete transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at 14.5 GPa. The emergence of bulk superconductivity coincides precisely with this transition.

Conclusion: The study definitively establishes the tetragonal I4/mmm structure as the host of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, resolving a central controversy and providing a critical foundation for understanding the superconducting mechanism in nickelates.

Abstract: The precise crystal structure of La3Ni2O7 in its high-pressure superconducting state has been a subject of intense debate, with proposed models including both orthorhombic and tetragonal symmetries. Using high-pressure Raman spectroscopy combined with frst-principles calculations, we unravel the structural evolution of La3Ni2O7 under pressure up to 32.7 GPa. We identify a clear structural transition sequence: from the orthorhombic Amam phase to a mixed Amam+Fmmm phase at 4 GPa, followed by a complete transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at 14.5 GPa, which is signaled by a pronounced phonon renormalization. The emergence of bulk superconductivity is found to coincide precisely with this transition to the I4/mmm phase. Our results de nitively establish the tetragonal I4/mmm structure as the host of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, resolving a central controversy and providing a critical foundation for understanding the superconducting mechanism in nickelates.

Motivation: 研究CDW与超导涡旋束缚态之间的相互作用，以推进超导物理和量子纳米技术的发展。

Method: 使用超低温扫描隧道显微镜/光谱技术研究了1T''-NbTe2中的涡旋束缚态。

Result: 观察到了由单向CDW调制的空间各向异性涡旋态，CDW畴边界导致涡旋取向和束缚态的突变。

Conclusion: 通过CDW调制的涡旋束缚态为超导涡旋工程提供了新途径。

Abstract: The interplay between charge density wave (CDW) and superconducting vortex bound states are crucial for fundamental physics of superconductivity and advancing quantum nanotechnologies. However, the CDW-mediated modulation of vortex bound states, which opens up a new platform for vortex engineering, remains unexplored. Here, we report spatially anisotropic vortex states modulated by the unidirectional CDWs in a transition-metal dichalcogenide superconductor 1T''-NbTe2 using ultra-low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The stripe-like 3x1x3 CDW order exhibits a robust three-dimensional character across step edges and coexists with superconductivity below a critical temperature of 0.4 K. Under out-of-plane magnetic fields, we observe elliptical vortices whose elongation aligns with the CDW stripes, indicating strong coupling between vortex morphology and underlying electronic order. Remarkably, CDW domain boundaries induce abrupt changes in vortex orientation and vortex bound states, enabling controllable vortex states across CDW nanodomains. These findings establish a new pathway for manipulating superconducting vortex bound states via CDW coupling.

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Thinner LaAlO3/KTaO3 layers unexpectedly boost superconductivity due to spin-orbit coupling and trigonal field effects, with signs of unconventional behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the unusual behavior of superconductivity in the two-dimensional limit of LaAlO3/KTaO3 heterostructures, where conventional wisdom suggests degradation of superconductivity with reduced thickness, but the study observed an enhancement.

Method: Experimental evidence was gathered using sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and superconducting upper-critical field measurements to analyze the trigonal symmetry and spin-orbit scattering.

Result: Reducing the conducting layer thickness enhanced the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), attributed to the synergy between spin-orbit coupling and trigonal crystal field. Unconventional superconductivity was indicated by linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance and the proximity to a quantum critical point.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the underlying mechanism of orientation-dependent superconductivity in LaAlO3/KTaO3 heterostructures, highlighting the enhancement of Tc through the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and trigonal crystal field, and suggests the presence of unconventional superconductivity.

Abstract: In conventional superconductors, bulk physical properties typically degrade as the film thickness approaches the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here in the (111) oriented LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) heterostructure, we demonstrate experimental evidence that reducing the conducting layer thickness at the interface significantly enhances superconducting transition temperature Tc, in direct contrast to conventional wisdom. From the sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and superconducting upper-critical field measurements, both the trigonal symmetry and spin orbit scattering are enhanced with the increased Tc. We attribute the enhanced superconductivity (SC) to the synergic interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and trigonal crystal field, resulting in an enhanced electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we show the existence of unconventional SC: the approaching linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance with increasing Tc and the existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) near the superconducting phase. Our findings provide important insight into the underlying mechanism of the strong orientation-dependent KTO interface SC.

TL;DR: The study visualizes coexisting bulk and surface superconducting gaps in γ-PtBi2, providing a platform for investigating Majorana bound states and Cooper pairings in topological materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the simultaneous presence of bulk and surface superconductivity in trigonal γ-PtBi2, a potential candidate for studying Majorana bound states.

Method: Ultra-low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy was used to directly visualize the coexisting bulk and surface superconducting gaps in trigonal PtBi2.

Result: The bulk gap was found to be Δ ~ 0.053 meV with a critical temperature (Tc) ~ 0.5 K and critical field below 0.01 T, while certain surface regions showed a larger gap of Δ ~ 0.42 meV, persisting up to Tc ~ 3 K and surviving magnetic fields up to 2 T.

Conclusion: The coexistence of robust surface and bulk superconductivity in γ-PtBi2 establishes it as a unique platform for studying the interplay between bulk and surface Cooper pairings in superconducting topological materials.

Abstract: A bulk superconductor hosting intrinsic surface superconductivity provides a unique platform to study Majorana bound states. The superconductor, trigonal γ-PtBi2, is a promising candidate, as surface superconducting gaps and topological surface states have been observed. However, the simultaneous presence of bulk and surface superconductivity has not been resolved. Here, we directly visualize coexisting bulk and surface superconducting gaps in trigonal PtBi2 by using ultra-low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The bulk gap is Δ ~ 0.053 meV with a critical temperature (Tc) ~ 0.5 K and a critical field below 0.01 T, accompanied by a vortex lattice and bound states, yielding a coherence length of ~200 nm. Remarkably, certain surface regions show a much larger gap of Δ ~ 0.42 meV, persisting up to Tc ~ 3 K and surviving magnetic fields up to 2 T, yet lacking a static vortex lattice. This coexistence of robust surface and bulk superconductivity establishes γ-PtBi2 as a unique platform for investigating the interplay between bulk and surface Cooper pairings in superconducting topological materials.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore and understand the pair density wave (PDW) state, which breaks conventional translational symmetry in superconductors without an external magnetic field, and its emergence from magnetic interactions, strong electron-electron correlations, and competing orders.

Method: The paper uses scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) due to its atomic-scale spatial resolution and advanced data analysis techniques to detect and study PDWs.

Conclusion: The abstract concludes by highlighting emerging challenges and future research directions to further understand the nature of pair density waves (PDWs) in superconductors.

Abstract: A pair density wave (PDW) is a superconducting state characterized by an order parameter with finite center-of-mass momentum in the absence of an external magnetic field, thereby breaking the conventional translational symmetry in homogeneous superconductors. It is proposed that PDW emerges from magnetic interactions, strong electron-electron correlations, and their interplay with competing orders. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the detection and study of PDWs using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). We focus on how the signatures of PDW have been experimentally visualized across a variety of extraordinary superconductors, including iron-based superconductors, cuprate superconductors, spin-triplet superconductors, kagome-lattice superconductors, and transition metal dichalcogenides. Beginning with an introduction to the fundamental concept of PDWs and the unique capabilities of STM/STS, particularly its atomic-scale spatial resolution and advanced data analysis techniques, we discuss key experimental findings, including the direct visualization of charge density modulations associated with PDWs. Finally, we discuss emerging challenges and future directions, aiming to inspire future research into the nature of PDWs in superconductors.

### [8] [Breakdown of Quantum Chaos in the Staggered-Field XXZ Chain: Confinement and Meson Formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14847)
*Julia Wildeboer,Marton Lajer,Robert M. Konik*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Study shows how confinement in a spin-$rac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain leads to non-ergodic behavior and mesonic scar states, validated by exact diagonalization and spectroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the restructuring of many-body spectra by fractionalized excitations and the resultant phenomena like Hilbert space fractionalization and quantum scar formation in a non-integrable spin-$rac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain under a staggered field.

Method: Exact diagonalization across symmetry-resolved sectors and meson spectroscopy analysis, including scrutinizing adjacent gap ratios, correlation, and entanglement measures.

Result: Crossover from chaotic to non-ergodic behavior with increasing anisotropy parameter $\Delta$, emergence of domain-wall banding in eigenstates, and quantitative agreement of low-lying spectrum with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The study establishes a unified account of confinement-induced nonergodicity in quantum spin chains, demonstrated through quantitative meson spectroscopy and detailed analysis of eigenstate properties.

Abstract: Confinement of fractionalized excitations can strongly restructure many-body spectra. We investigate this phenomenon in the gapped spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a staggered field, where spinons bind into domain-wall ``mesons'' deep in the antiferromagnetic phase. We present evidence that this non-integrable model exhibits both Hilbert space fractionalization and quantum scar formation as controlled by the anisotropy parameter $Δ$. Exact diagonalization across symmetry-resolved sectors reveals a crossover from Gaussian-orthogonal (chaotic) level statistics at weak anisotropy $Δ\sim 1$ to non-ergodic behavior deep in the antiferromagnetic regime $Δ\gg 1$ through scrutinizing the adjacent gap ratios, accompanied by a striking banding of eigenstates by domain-wall number in correlation and entanglement measures. The Page-like entanglement dome characteristic of chaotic spectra gives way to suppressed, band-resolved entanglement consistent with emergent quasi-conservation of domain walls. To investigate further the formation mechanism of mesonic scar states, we carry out meson spectroscopy near the two-spinon threshold and compare with the analytic ladder predicted by Rutkevich [Phys. Rev. B 106, 134405 (2022)]. We test the theory through continuum-relative bindings, an offset-removed Airy scaling collapse, and explicit two-meson thresholds that determine the number of stable meson levels. The low-lying spectrum shows close quantitative agreement, while deviations at higher energies are consistent with finite-size and subleading corrections. These results establish a unified account of confinement-induced nonergodicity and provide a template for quantitative meson spectroscopy in quantum spin chains.

TL;DR: The paper reveals new families of quantum many-body scars in the spin-1 XY model, showcasing interference and algebraic mechanisms to classify non-ergodic states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new families of exact scar eigenstates beyond previously studied towers of states and understand their origins through symmetries and interference.

Method: Revisiting the spin-1 XY model on a periodic chain, constructing exact scar eigenstates using an interplay of U(1) magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries, and employing the commutant algebra framework.

Result: Identification of novel interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, equally spaced ladders under a transverse magnetic field, and two more families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states and mirror-dimer states.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the power and interplay of interference-based and algebraic mechanisms in identifying and classifying quantum many-body scars (QMBS), providing systematic routes for future studies in generic many-body quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, characterized by the coexistence of atypical non-thermal eigenstates within an otherwise thermalizing many-body spectrum. In this work, we revisit the spin-$1$ $XY$ model on a periodic chain and construct several new families of exact scar eigenstates embedded within its extensively degenerate manifolds that owe their origins to an interplay of $U(1)$ magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries. We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom. Our results illustrate the power and interplay of interference-based and algebraic mechanisms of non-ergodicity, offering systematic routes to identifying and classifying QMBS in generic many-body quantum systems.

TL;DR: Spin-phonon coupling in α-RuCl₃ induces chiral phonons under a magnetic field, detectable via Raman circular dichroism (RCD), aligning with experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unexpected chiral phonon behavior observed in recent Raman experiments on α-RuCl₃, which revealed a finite Raman circular dichroism (RCD).

Method: A diagrammatic framework for the spin-phonon coupled Kitaev model was developed to analyze the Raman circular dichroism (RCD) in α-RuCl₃.

Result: The study shows that while bare phonons contribute no RCD, their coupling to the chiral spin excitation continuum under an applied magnetic field renormalizes the phonon propagator, inducing a nonzero RCD and characteristic Fano line shapes in the Raman response.

Conclusion: The study establishes Raman circular dichroism (RCD) as a powerful tool for probing interaction-induced chiral phonons in correlated quantum materials, with findings consistent with experimental observations.

Abstract: Recent Raman experiments on the Kitaev material $α$-RuCl$_3$ have reported a finite Raman circular dichroism (RCD), revealing chiral phonon behaviour not expected from lattice symmetry alone. To explain this observation, we develop a diagrammatic framework for the spin-phonon coupled Kitaev model. We demonstrate that bare phonons contribute no RCD, but coupling to the chiral spin excitation continuum under an applied magnetic field renormalizes the phonon propagator, mixing real polarization eigenvectors into complex superpositions with finite angular momentum. This interaction-induced modification generates a nonzero RCD accompanied by characteristic Fano line shapes in the Raman response, reflecting interference between discrete phonons and the continuum. The resulting signal grows with magnetic field strength, consistent with experiment, and directly tracks the field-induced chirality of the spin sector. More broadly, our results establish RCD as a powerful probe of interaction-induced chiral phonons in correlated quantum materials.

TL;DR: This study investigates the formation of quantum spin liquids (QSL) at finite temperatures by analyzing entanglement patterns in two models, identifying key temperatures for entanglement emergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite extensive research on entanglement properties in ground states of QSL, the formation of these states at finite temperatures remains poorly understood. This study aims to explore how entanglement patterns emerge as temperature decreases.

Method: The paper introduces a method to characterize the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, applying it to two models: the Kitaev honeycomb model and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice.

Result: The results pinpoint the temperatures where spins first become entangled in the high-temperature paramagnet and when the system develops multipartite entanglement characteristic of QSL ground states.

Conclusion: The study successfully identifies specific temperatures at which entanglement first forms in the high-temperature paramagnet and when structured multipartite entanglement characteristic of QSL ground states develops. This provides a new method for understanding the formation of QSL at finite temperatures.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSL) are phases of matter which are distinguished not by the symmetries they break, but rather by the patterns of entanglement within them. Although these entanglement properties have been widely discussed for ground states, the way in which QSL form at finite temperature remains an open question. Here we introduce a method of characterizing both the depth and spatial structure of entanglement, and use this to explore how patterns of entanglement form as temperature is reduced in two widely studied models of QSL, the Kitaev honeycomb model, and the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a Kagome lattice. These results enable us to evaluate both the temperature at which spins within the high-temperature paramagnet first become entangled, and the temperature at which the system first develops the structured, multipartite entanglement characteristic of its QSL ground state.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the theoretical and experimental challenges in assessing anisotropic intersite exchange interactions in frustrated rare-earth magnets.

Method: An ab initio force-theorem framework combining the Hubbard-I approach for 4f correlations with a static mean-field treatment of the on-site intershell Coulomb interaction.

Result: Indirect exchange dominates in CsCeSe$_2$, superexchange in RbCeO$_2$, and both mechanisms contribute equally in KCeS$_2$, with magnetic excitation spectra matching experimental data.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully captures the interplay between 4f superexchange and 5d-mediated indirect exchange in frustrated rare-earth magnets, validated by experimental data.

Abstract: Anisotropic intersite exchange interactions in frustrated rare-earth magnets are difficult to assess both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we propose an ab initio force-theorem framework combining the quasi-atomic Hubbard-I approach to 4f correlations with a static mean-field treatment of the on-site intershell Coulomb interaction between rare-earth 4f and 5d states to simultaneously capture both 4f superexchange and 5d-mediated indirect exchange. Applying it to the triangular lattice Ce delafossites CsCeSe$_2$, KCeS$_2$, and RbCeO$_2$, we find that the indirect exchange dominates in the selenide, the superexchange in the oxide, while both mechanisms contribute almost equally in the sulfide. The magnetic exciation spectra of CsCeSe$_2$ and KCeS$_2$ evaluated from the calculated spin Hamiltonains are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental data.

TL;DR: Magnetic forces drive the MIT in rare-earth nickelates, with structural distortions enabling necessary spin configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the mechanisms behind the metal-insulator transition in rare-earth nickelates, particularly the role of magnetic interactions and structural distortions.

Method: Analysis of phase transitions in rare-earth nickelates RNiO3, focusing on structural, metal-insulator, and magnetic transitions.

Result: The MIT is driven primarily by magnetic forces, with structural distortions enabling disproportionate Ni spin configurations (high-spin and low-spin) to reduce orbital moment and open a gap.

Conclusion: The primary driving force for the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in rare-earth nickelates is magnetic, supported by the unusual d7 configuration of Ni, while structural distortions provide the necessary flexibility for spin configurations.

Abstract: Rare-earth nickelates RNiO3 (R=rare-earth element) exhibit three kinds of phase transitions with decreasing temperature: a structural transition from a pseudo-cubic to a monoclinic phase, a metal- insulator transition (MIT), and a magnetic transition from a paramagnetic state to an ordered one. The first two occur at the same temperature, which has led to a consensus that the MIT is driven by lattice distortions. We show here that the primary driving force for the MIT is magnetic; however because of the unusual d7 configuration of Ni, additional flexibility in spin configurations are also needed which symmetry-lowing structural deformations make possible. The latter enable Ni to disproportionate into two kinds: a high-spin and a low-spin configuration, which allow the system to reduce its unfavorable orbital moment and also open a gap.

TL;DR: Functional heterostructures combining 2D magnets and TMDs face detection challenges. A molecular-TMD interface offers tunable excitons for enhanced functionality and probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of detecting and functionalizing proximity-induced magnetic interlayer excitons in 2D magnet-TMD heterostructures.

Method: A high fidelity ab initio many body diagrammatic approach.

Result: Molecular excitons exhibit tunable properties, including energy, spin states, and brightness, with potential applications in quantum technologies.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that molecular excitons in transition metal molecule-TMD interfaces can be tuned for enhanced functionality, offering a promising pathway for probing and manipulating magnetic excitonic states.

Abstract: A functional heterostructure is central to integrated circuitry in quantum photonics, optoelectronics, neuromorphic computing, spintronics, and straintronics. Recently, heterostructures combining 2D magnets and nonmagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been explored. In these, electron and hole wavefunctions are localized in 2D magnets but delocalized in TMDs. When combined, a proximity induced magnetic inter layer exciton can emerge, with energy differing by 20 to 30 meV from intra layer excitons and being two orders of magnitude darker, making it hard to detect and functionalize. Using a high fidelity ab initio many body diagrammatic approach, we show that functionality can be significantly enhanced in a transition metal molecule TMD interface. The molecular exciton exhibits charge transfer character and is extended, unlike the localized Frenkel excitation in 2D magnets. Moreover, the degree of localization and magnetic moment can be tuned by varying the molecular orientation relative to the TMD. This changes the proximity to the magnetic ion, altering screening and enabling a pathway to quench the ion's spin moment. This inverse proximity effect tunes the energies, spin states, and brightness of molecular and inter layer magnetic excitons, a mechanism absent in 2D magnet TMD systems. We also identify conditions under which the interlayer exciton becomes well separated and brighter than intra layer excitons, making it promising for protocols that probe and manipulate magnetic excitonic states.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fractionalized excitations like spinons and anyons are central to condensed matter physics, with implications for superconductivity and quantum computation. The system β-VOSO₄ provides a promising experimental platform due to its lack of long-range order at low temperatures.

Method: Raman spectroscopy was employed to probe magnetic excitations and the evolution of spin correlations in β-VOSO₄, with results compared to numerical density matrix renormalization group calculations.

Result: Spinon signatures were observed along the chain direction, evidenced by a broad, gapless scattering continuum at low temperatures. The spinon spectral weight aligns with numerical calculations, and the QFI showed a steep increase upon cooling, indicating rapidly growing correlation lengths.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the utility of quantum Fisher information (QFI) as a probe for spin correlations in quantum magnets, particularly in the nearly ideal one-dimensional system β-VOSO₄.

Abstract: Fractionalized excitations such as spinons and anyons have emerged as a central theme in condensed matter physics with broad implications for superconductivity, quantum statistics, and quantum computation. The nearly ideal one-dimensional $S=1/2$ system $β$-VOSO$_4$ without long-range order down to 85 mK provides a promising platform to experimentally explore such fractionalized excitations. Here, we employ Raman spectroscopy to probe magnetic excitations and the evolution of spin correlations in $β$-VOSO$_4$. Spinon signatures are found along the chain direction, evidenced by a broad, gapless scattering continuum at low temperatures. The temperature dependence of the spinon spectral weight aligns considerably with numerical density matrix renormalization group calculations. By comparing the experimental spinon spectral weight with calculated results and evaluating the associated quantum Fisher information (QFI) therefrom, we observe a steep increase in QFI upon cooling, indicating rapidly growing correlation lengths. Our study showcases QFI as a probe of spin correlations in quantum magnets.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The study reveals that La2NiO4 exhibits robust magnetism and lacks superconductivity due to unfavorable pairing symmetry under pressure, suggesting alternative approaches like doping or strain may be required for superconductivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To elucidate the electronic structure and quantum many-body instabilities of monolayer nickelate La2NiO4 under hydrostatic pressure.

Method: Combination of density functional theory, dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), and random phase approximation (RPA).

Result: Non-Fermi-liquid behavior and coherence loss near the Fermi level at low pressures, with robust magnetic order dominating the ground state and preventing superconductivity in the pristine system. A pressure-driven symmetry transition in superconducting instabilities is observed, transitioning from d_(x2-y2)-wave to s+g-wave symmetry above 75 GPa.

Conclusion: The absence of superconductivity in La2NiO4 is attributed to its robust intrinsic magnetism and unfavorable pairing symmetry under pressure. Alternative methods, such as chemical doping or epitaxial strain, are suggested to suppress magnetism and potentially unlock superconducting states.

Abstract: We elucidate the electronic structure and quantum many-body instabilities of the monolayer nickelate La2NiO4 under hydrostatic pressure using a combination of density functional theory, dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), and random phase approximation (RPA). Our DFT+DMFT calculations reveal non-Fermi-liquid behavior and coherence loss near the Fermi level at low pressures, driven by strong electron correlations within the Ni-e_g orbital manifold, which is analogous to the low-energy electronic properties observed in La3Ni2O7. However, multi-orbital spin susceptibility analysis demonstrates an exceptionally suppressed critical Stoner parameter U_c (about 0.4~0.7 eV), indicating robust magnetic order that dominates the ground state and precludes superconductivity in the pristine system. Below U_c, superconducting instabilities exhibit a pressure-driven symmetry transition: the d_(x2-y2)-wave pairing prevails at ambient and low pressure, while the s+g-wave symmetry occurs above 75 GPa. This transition is attributed to pressure-induced self-doping effect. The high-angular-momentum g-wave component incurs significant energetic penalties, rendering high-Tc superconductivity unlikely. We conclude that the absence of superconductivity in La2NiO4 arises from its robust intrinsic magnetism and the unfavorable pairing symmetry under pressure, suggesting that alternative routes-such as chemical doping or epitaxial strain-are necessary to suppress magnetism and unlock superconducting states.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore the emergence of non-Abelian zero modes from twist defects in Abelian topological phases and understand their properties, particularly how they affect physical phenomena like Josephson tunneling.

Method: The study uses a setup involving a fractional quantum Hall-superconductor heterostructure, modeling twist defects at interfaces between two such structures to analyze the induced phase transition and resulting zero modes.

Result: The results show that the system supports distinct types of zero modes at fixed filling, with parafermions associated with each anyonic symmetry, impacting the periodicity of Josephson tunneling current.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that twist defects in Abelian topological phases can give rise to non-Abelian zero modes, characterized by parafermions, which influence the periodicity of Josephson tunneling current.

Abstract: We discuss the emergence of non-Abelian zero modes from twist defects in Abelian topological phases. We consider a setup built from a fractional quantum Hall (FQH)-superconductor heterostructure, which effectively induces a phase transition, leading to a topological phase endowed with new anyonic symmetries, and accordingly supporting distinct types of zero modes at fixed filling. These defects are modeled at the interface between two copies of the same heterostructure arranged side by side, which produces counterpropagating modes that can be gapped by interactions that realize the anyonic symmetries. We characterize the parafermions associated with each anyonic symmetry and discuss how their presence affect the periodicity of Josephson tunneling current.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the crystal structure and physical properties of the newly discovered vdW ferromagnet FePd2Te2 and its compositional variants, focusing on structural transitions and magnetic behavior.

Method: Detailed analysis using temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and transport measurements to study crystal structure and physical properties of Fe_xPd_yTe2 compounds.

Result: The compounds exhibit first-order structural transitions, metallic behavior, and easy-plane ferromagnetism with Curie temperatures between 98-180 K. Structural and magnetic properties are influenced by Fe and Pd fractions (x and y).

Conclusion: The study highlights the structural and magnetic properties of FePd2Te2 and its variants, demonstrating synthetic control over composition (x and y) as a tool for exploring these compounds further. The structural transitions and ferromagnetic behavior are key findings.

Abstract: Here, we provide a detailed study of the crystal structure and physical properties of the recently discovered vdW ferromagnet FePd$_2$Te$_2$. We find this compound has a relatively wide width of formation, and grow single crystals with compositions Fe$_x$Pd$_{y}$Te$_2$ where $x$ ranges from 0.9 to 1.1 and $y$ from 1.8 to 2.5, respectively. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and transport measurements reveal that a first-order structural transition occurs in the range of $T$ = 360-420 K. Above the transition, the compounds with Pd fraction $y>2$ adopt a disordered derivative of the tetragonal FeTe structure, with the Fe layer showing mixed Fe/Pd occupancy and the extra Pd atoms partially occupying interstitial sites. Below 370 K, the structure is incommensurately modulated. For $y<2$, the composition Fe$_{1.1}$Pd$_{1.8}$Te$_2$ has monoclinic symmetry at room temperature that is consistent with the reported structure of FePd$_2$Te$_2$. This phase undergoes a structural transition at 420 K for which the high temperature structure is yet to be determined; however, based on the similarities with the $y > 2$ compounds, we speculate that this composition also adopts a tetragonal structure above 420\,K. All compounds investigated in the Fe$_x$Pd$_{y}$Te$_2$ series show metallic behavior, with magnetic characterization indicating that they are easy-plane, hard, ferromagnets with $T_C$ spanning 98--180 K. Both the critical temperature for the structural transition and the Curie temperature are moderately suppressed with increasing Pd fraction $y$ and corresponding decreasing Fe fraction $x$, indicating that synthetic control over $x$ and $y$ paves way for the further exploration of these compounds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantitatively analyze symmetry breaking in dynamical systems using entropy and information transfer as early indicators.

Method: An entropy-based framework using information transfer to measure directional entropy exchange between observables, supported by numerical examples.

Result: Trajectories show critical slowing down and entropy rise as symmetric equilibrium approaches instability, indicating symmetry loss.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a direct link between symmetry loss, critical slowing down, and entropy growth, with entropy and information transfer measures serving as reliable indicators of symmetry breaking transitions.

Abstract: We develop an entropy based framework for analyzing symmetry breaking in dynamical systems. Information transfer, which measures the directional exchange of entropy between observables, provides a quantitative early indicator of symmetry loss. For local spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), we show that as a symmetric equilibrium approaches instability, trajectories exhibit pronounced critical slowing down accompanied by a rise in Shannon entropy. This establishes a direct link between symmetry loss, slowing down, and entropy growth. We further characterize the entropy discontinuity associated with global symmetry breaking (GSSB) through an ergodic decomposition viewpoint. Numerical examples illustrate that entropy and information transfer measures serve as reliable precursors and diagnostics of symmetry breaking transitions.

Conclusion: The study identifies and characterizes a new long-range random universality class in the weakly diluted Ising model, providing estimates for the correlation length critical exponent under specific conditions.

Abstract: We analyse the critical properties of a weakly diluted (random) Ising model with the long-range interaction decaying with distance $x$ as $\sim x^{-d-σ}$ in a $d$-dimensional space. It is known to belong to a new long-range random universality class for certain values of the decay parameter $σ$. Exploiting the field-theoretic renormalization group approach within the minimal subtraction scheme, we compute the three-loop rermalization group functions. On their basis, with the help of asymptotic series resummation methods, we estimate the correlation length critical exponent $ν$ characterising the new universality class for $d=3$ and for those values of $σ$ for which long-range interactions are relevant for the critical behaviour.

Abstract: We present an exact analytical solution for the one-dimensional Ising model in the presence of an external magnetic field applied periodically to every $k$-th site. The problem is handled using the symmetrized transfer matrix approach, we derive a compact closed-form expression for the system's eigenvalues for arbitrary period $k$.

Explicit results are presented for $k = 1$, $k = 2$, and $k = 3$ which is considered a novel result. We further analyze the spin-spin correlation functions, deriving the correlation length and the set of position-dependent correlation strength prefactors, $A_{ij}$. The framework highlights how impurity spacing suppresses thermodynamic responses, with susceptibility scaling as $χ\sim β/ k$ for large $k$, offering insights into diluted magnetic systems and serving as a benchmark for quasiperiodic modulations. The correlation strengths exhibit a strong anisotropy, revealing a complex, non-local structure of spin fluctuations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the vanishing gradient problem (barren plateau) in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) during gradient descent optimization

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach combining classical PID controller with a neural network (NPID) to update variational quantum circuit parameters, tested on random quantum states and circuits under various noise conditions

Result: NPID achieves 2-9 times higher convergence efficiency than NEQP and QV, with 4.45% average performance fluctuation across noise levels

Conclusion: NPID method demonstrates superior convergence efficiency and stability, suggesting a promising direction for enhancing variational quantum algorithms by integrating classical control theory

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) combine the advantages of classical optimization and quantum computation, making them one of the most promising approaches in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. However, when optimized using gradient descent, VQAs often suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, commonly known as the barren plateau. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates a classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with a neural network to update the parameters of variational quantum circuits. We refer to this method as NPID, which aims to mitigate the barren plateau. The proposed algorithm is tested on randomly generated quantum input states and random quantum circuits with parametric noise to evaluate its universality, and additional simulations are conducted under different noise rates to examine its robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated based on its convergence speed toward the target cost value. Simulation results show that NPID achieves a convergence efficiency 2-9 times higher than NEQP and QV, with performance fluctuations averaging only 4.45% across different noise levels. These results highlight the potential of integrating classical control theory into quantum optimization, providing a new perspective for improving the trainability and stability of variational quantum algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how problem structure influences algorithmic resilience in quantum computing under real-world noise conditions.

Method: A hardware-aware benchmarking study of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm across 11 diverse test patterns on multiple superconducting quantum processors.

Result: Algorithmic performance is highly sensitive to problem structure, with success rates dropping dramatically from 100% (ideal) to 26.4% (real hardware). State fidelity also correlates strongly with pattern density.

Conclusion: The study establishes pattern-dependent performance as a critical factor for quantum algorithm deployment and provides a framework for predicting feasibility in practical applications.

Abstract: Quantum computers promise to redefine the boundaries of computational science, offering the potential for exponential speedups in solving complex problems across chemistry, optimization, and materials science. Yet, their practical utility remains constrained by unpredictable performance degradation under real-world noise conditions. A key question is how problem structure itself influences algorithmic resilience. In this work, we present a comprehensive, hardware-aware benchmarking study of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm across 11 diverse test patterns on multiple superconducting quantum processors, revealing that algorithmic performance is exquisitely sensitive to problem structure. Our results reveal average success rates of 100.0\% (ideal simulation), 85.2\% (noisy emulation), and 26.4\% (real hardware), representing a dramatic 58.8\% average performance gap between noisy emulation and real hardware execution. With quantum state tomography confirming corresponding average state fidelities of 0.993, 0.760, and a 0.234 fidelity drop to hardware. Performance degrades dramatically from 75.7\% success for sparse patterns to complete failure for high-density 10-qubit patterns. Most strikingly, quantum state tomography reveals a near-perfect correlation between pattern density and state fidelity degradation, providing the fundamental explanation for observed performance patterns. The catastrophic fidelity collapse observed in real hardware measurements -- dropping to 0.111 compared to the predicted 0.763 -- underscores severe limitations in current noise models for capturing structure-dependent error mechanisms. Our work establishes pattern-dependent performance as a critical consideration for quantum algorithm deployment and provides a quantitative framework for predicting algorithm feasibility in practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of DFT in strongly correlated systems and solve the N-representability problem using techniques from symplectic geometry, with a focus on understanding the 'boundary force' phenomenon.

Method: Utilizes mathematical frameworks from reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) and symplectic geometry, specifically momentum maps, to generalize ground state functional theories for fermionic, bosonic, and spin systems.

Result: Develops a formula capturing the boundary force's exact behavior near the domain boundary, with a rigorous proof for abelian Lie algebras based on Levy-Lieb constrained search.

Conclusion: The study provides a quantitative understanding of the boundary force in functional theories and offers a formula for its exact behavior near the domain boundary, which could improve current RDMFT functionals like Piris NOFs.

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is an indispensable ab initio method in both quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Based on recent advancements in reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT), a variant of DFT that is believed to be better suited for strongly correlated systems, we construct a mathematical framework generalizing all ground state functional theories, which in particular applies to fermionic, bosonic, and spin systems. We show that within the special class of such functional theories where the space of external potentials forms the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group, the $N$-representability problem is readily solved by applying techniques from the study of momentum maps in symplectic geometry, an approach complementary to Klyachko's famous solution to the quantum marginal problem. The ``boundary force'', a diverging repulsive force from the boundary of the functional's domain observed in previous works but only qualitatively understood in isolated systems, is studied quantitatively and extensively in our work. Specifically, we present a formula capturing the exact behavior of the functional close to the boundary. In the case where the Lie algebra is abelian, a completely rigorous proof of the boundary force formula based on Levy-Lieb constrained search is given. Our formula is a first step towards developing more accurate functional approximations, with the potential of improving current RDMFT approximate functionals such as the Piris natural orbital functionals (NOFs). All key concepts and ideas of our work are demonstrated in translation invariant bosonic lattice systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the robustness of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) under noise-induced errors in initial state preparation across different many-body systems, aiming to identify systems where accelerated thermalisation or symmetry restoration remains feasible despite practical imperfections.

Method: The analysis involves modeling the impact of noise-induced errors in initial state preparation on the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), using both Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equations for open system dynamics and $U(1)$ symmetric random unitary circuits.

Result: Exponential accelerated thermalisation in open system dynamics is highly sensitive to initial noise, whereas accelerated symmetry restoration in $U(1)$ symmetric circuits is robust and can even be enhanced by large state preparation errors.

Conclusion: The study highlights the sensitivity of exponential accelerated thermalisation in open system dynamics to initial state noise, while demonstrating the robustness of accelerated symmetry restoration in $U(1)$ symmetric random unitary circuits even under state preparation errors. Large initial errors can even enhance symmetry restoration and the QME in such circuits.

Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) is a phenomenon observed in many-body systems where initial systems configurations farther from equilibrium can be observed to equilibrate faster than configurations that are closer to it. By considering noise induced error in the initial system state preparation, we analyse the robustness of various models exhibiting the QME. We demonstrate that exponentially accelerated thermalisation in open system dynamics modelled by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation is highly sensitive to noise induced deviations in the initial state, making this approach to accelerated thermalisation difficult to achieve. In contrast, we demonstrate that accelerated restoration of symmetry in $U(1)$ symmetric random unitary circuits via increased initial symmetry breaking is robust in the presence of state preparation error. When large errors are present in the state preparation, we show that this can in fact induce a higher rate of symmetry restoration and a stronger QME.

This approach brings diverse codes into a unified framework and binds them through a single underlying symmetry.

Method: The study investigates the fundamental time complexity for preparing entangled states in quantum metrology, focusing on the relationship between the minimum preparation time and the Quantum Fisher Information (F_Q) for systems with varying interaction ranges.

Result: For short-range interactions, the minimum time scales as t ≳ L^γ. For long-range interactions, a hierarchy of speedups is identified, with t scaling differently depending on the interaction range and dimensionality.

Conclusion: The findings establish a benchmark for the time-optimality of protocols in preparing metrologically useful quantum states, showing that the derived bounds are tight under certain conditions.

Abstract: We investigate the fundamental time complexity, as constrained by Lieb-Robinson bounds, for preparing entangled states useful in quantum metrology. We relate the minimum time to the Quantum Fisher Information ($F_Q$) for a system of $N$ quantum spins on a $d$-dimensional lattice with $1/r^α$ interactions with $r$ being the distance between two interacting spins. We focus on states with $F_Q \sim N^{1+γ}$ where $γ\in (0,1]$, i.e., scaling from the standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg limit. For short-range interactions ($α> 2d+1$), we prove the minimum time $t$ scales as $t \gtrsim L^γ$, where $L \sim N^{1/d}$. For long-range interactions, we find a hierarchy of possible speedups: $t \gtrsim L^{γ(α-2d)}$ for $2d < α< 2d+1$, $t \gtrsim \log L$ for $(2-γ)d < α< 2d$, and $t$ may even vanish algebraically in $1/L$ for $α< (2-γ)d$. These bounds extend to the minimum circuit depth required for state preparation, assuming two-qubit gate speeds scale as $1/r^α$. We further show that these bounds are saturable, up to sub-polynomial corrections, for all $α$ at the Heisenberg limit ($γ=1$) and for $α> (2-γ)d$ when $γ<1$. Our results establish a benchmark for the time-optimality of protocols that prepare metrologically useful quantum states.

TL;DR: A method for exact and efficient factorization of spin-adapted unitaries in quantum algorithms, preserving spin symmetry and reducing implementation costs through Lie algebra optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving spin symmetry in variational quantum algorithms is crucial for producing physically meaningful electronic wavefunctions, but implementing spin-adapted transformations on quantum hardware is challenging due to noncommuting Pauli operators.

Method: The method introduces an exact and computationally efficient factorization of spin-adapted unitaries derived from fermionic double excitation and deexcitation rotations. It expresses these unitaries as ordered products of exponentials of Pauli operators, leveraging the fact that the elementary operators form small Lie algebras. The factorization problem is reformulated as a low-dimensional nonlinear optimization over matrix exponentials in the adjoint representation of these algebras.

Conclusion: The proposed factorization provides a practical strategy for constructing symmetry-conserving quantum circuits within variational algorithms, preserving spin symmetry, reducing implementation cost, and ensuring accurate representation of electronic states in quantum simulations of molecular systems.

Abstract: Preserving spin symmetry in variational quantum algorithms is essential for producing physically meaningful electronic wavefunctions. Implementing spin-adapted transformations on quantum hardware, however, is challenging because the corresponding fermionic generators translate into noncommuting Pauli operators. In this work, we introduce an exact and computationally efficient factorization of spin-adapted unitaries derived from fermionic double excitation and deexcitation rotations. These unitaries are expressed as ordered products of exponentials of Pauli operators. Our method exploits the fact that the elementary operators in these generators form small Lie algebras. By working in the adjoint representation of these algebras, we reformulate the factorization problem as a low-dimensional nonlinear optimization over matrix exponentials. This approach enables precise numerical reparametrization of the unitaries without relying on symbolic manipulations. The proposed factorization provides a practical strategy for constructing symmetry-conserving quantum circuits within variational algorithms. It preserves spin symmetry by design, reduces implementation cost, and ensures the accurate representation of electronic states in quantum simulations of molecular systems.

*Tom Dodd,Javier Martínez-Cifuentes,Oliver Thomson Brown,Nicolás Quesada,Raúl García-Patrón*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Classical simulation outperforms quantum boson sampling on a single CPU/GPU, reducing resource needs and enabling broader applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the high computational cost and resource requirements of classical simulations in matching the performance of quantum devices, particularly in sampling problems, and to make such simulations more accessible.

Method: The method involves classical simulation techniques that are embarrassingly parallelizable, enabling the use of a single CPU or GPU to outperform previous results that required significantly more resources (e.g., over one hundred GPUs).

Result: The results show that a single CPU or GPU can outperform Gaussian boson sampling experiments of one hundred modes on benchmark tests, matching previous sampling rates with fewer resources.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the demonstrated classical simulation tools have the potential to be generalized for more complex scenarios, including photo-counting and qubit-based sampling problems, and may serve as classical surrogates for classical-quantum algorithms.

Abstract: If classical algorithms have been successful in reproducing the estimation of expectation values of observables of some quantum circuits using off-the-shelf computing resources, matching the performance of the most advanced quantum devices on sampling problems usually requires extreme cost in terms of memory and computing operations, making them accessible to only a handful of supercomputers around the world. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a classical simulation outperforming Gaussian boson sampling experiments of one hundred modes on established benchmark tests using a single CPU or GPU. Being embarrassingly parallelizable, a small number of CPUs or GPUs allows us to match previous sampling rates that required more than one hundred GPUs. We believe algorithmic and implementation improvements will generalize our tools to photo-counting, single-photon inputs, and pseudo-photon-number-resolving scenarios beyond one thousand modes. Finally, most of the innovations in our tools remain valid for generic probability distributions over binary variables, rendering it potentially applicable to the simulation of qubit-based sampling problems and creating classical surrogates for classical-quantum algorithms.

TL;DR: A globalized approach in quantum Rabi model enhances critical quantum metrology by extending criticality, enabling high precision measurements across coupling regimes, resilient to decoherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the restriction of the quantum phase transition's local regime in the quantum Rabi model, which limits its application in critical quantum metrology.

Method: Introducing an auxiliary nonlinear term to the quantum Rabi model, extending the critical point to a continuous regime, and demonstrating the approach via quantum Fisher information and quadrature dynamics analysis.

Result: Achieving globally accessible diverging quantum Fisher information and enhanced measurement precision from the original critical point to the weak-coupling limit, even with decoherence.

Conclusion: The proposed globalized critical quantum metrology in the quantum Rabi model overcomes the limitation of local criticality, enabling high measurement precision across the entire coupling regime, including scenarios with decoherence.

Abstract: Quantum Rabi model (QRM) is a fundamental model for light-matter interactions, the finite-component quantum phase transition (QPT) in the QRM has established a paradigmatic application for critical quantum metrology (CQM). However, such a paradigmatic application is restricted to a local regime of the QPT which has only a single critical point. In this work we propose a globalized CQM in the QRM by introducing an auxiliary nonlinear term which is realizable and can extend the critical point to a continuous critical regime. As a consequence, a high measurement precision is globally available over the entire coupling regime from the original critical point of the QRM down to the weak-coupling limit, as demonstrated by the globally accessible diverging quantum Fisher information in dynamics. We illustrate a measurement scheme by quadrature dynamics, with globally criticality-enhanced inverted variance as well as the scaling relation with respect to finite frequencies. In particular, we find that the globally high measurement precisions still survive in the presence of decoherence. Our proposal paves a way to break the local limitation of QPT of the QRM in CQM and enables a broader application, with implications of applicability in realistic situation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore non-local magic as a key resource for quantum advantage and to advance reliable pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices.

Method: Experimental demonstration using a superconducting Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) with direct access to identify and characterize noise mechanisms.

Result: Excellent agreement between theory and experiment, validating the ability to harness local and non-local magic separately, and identifying dominant noise mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the first experimental evidence of non-local magic in a superconducting QPU, highlighting its importance for quantum advantage and fault-tolerant computing. The methods developed also open avenues for purity estimation and Hawking radiation decoding.

Abstract: Magic is a non-classical resource whose efficient manipulation is fundamental to advancing efficient and scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing. Quantum advantage is possible only if both magic and entanglement are present. Of particular interest is non-local magic- the fraction of the resource that cannot be distilled (or erased) by local unitary operations - which is a necessary feature for quantum complex behavior. We perform the first experimental demonstration of non-local magic in a superconducting Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Direct access to the QPU device enables us to identify and characterize the dominant noise mechanisms intrinsic to the quantum hardware. We observe excellent agreement between theory and experiment without the need for any free parameter in the noise modeling of our system and shows the experimental capability of harnessing both local and non-local magic resources separately, thereby offering a promising path towards more reliable pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices and to advance hardware-aware research in quantum information in the near term. Finally, the methods and tools developed in this work are conducive to the experimental realization of efficient purity estimation (featuring exponential speedup) and the decoding of Hawking radiation from a toy-model of a Black Hole.

Abstract: Optimal measurements for quantum multiparameter estimation are complicated by the uncertainty principle. Generally, there is a trade-off between the precision with which different parameters can be simultaneously estimated. The task of determining the minimum achievable estimation error is a central task of multiparameter quantum metrology. For estimating parameters encoded in pure quantum states, the ultimate limit is known, but is given by the solution of a non-trivial minimisation problem. We present a new expression for the achievable bound for two-parameter estimation with pure states that is considerably simpler. We also determine the optimal measurements, completing the problem of two-parameter estimation with pure state probes. To demonstrate the utility of our result, we determine the precision limit for estimating displacements using grid states.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the application of interacting Rydberg atoms in quantum metrology and sensing, particularly to harness their emergent collective nonlinearity for enhanced time series prediction.

Method: The researchers utilized an interacting Rydberg vapour driven by a modulated laser field to input time series data. The system's response was studied near a non-equilibrium phase transition to observe collective effects.

Result: The results show that near a non-equilibrium phase transition, the system's ability to learn and predict future values of time series (e.g., Lorenz time series and temperature data) is significantly enhanced.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that interacting Rydberg atoms, when operating near a non-equilibrium phase transition, exhibit enhanced capabilities for time series prediction, highlighting the potential of noisy many-body quantum systems in data processing and forecasting applications.

Abstract: Interacting Rydberg atoms constitute a versatile platform for the realization of non-equilibrium states of matter. Close to phase transitions, they respond collectively to external perturbations, which can be harnessed for technological applications in the domain of quantum metrology and sensing. Owing to the controllable complexity and straightforward interpretability of Rydberg atoms, we can observe and tune the emergent collective nonlinearity. Here, we investigate the application of an interacting Rydberg vapour for the purpose of time series prediction. The vapour is driven by a laser field whose Rabi frequency is modulated in order to input the time series. We find that close to a non-equilibrium phase transition, where collective effects are amplified, the capability of the system to learn the input becomes enhanced. This is reflected in an increase of the accuracy with which future values of the time series can be predicted. Using the Lorenz time series and temperature data as examples, our work demonstrates how emergent phenomena enhance the capability of noisy many-body quantum systems for data processing and forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the trade-off in conventional squeezing methods, which degrade squeezing levels due to optical tapping, and to advance the feasibility of fault-tolerant optical quantum computation.

Method: The study improves upon previous work by introducing a novel phase detection technique that eliminates the need for tapping squeezed light. A phase-detection OPA seeded by tapped probe and pump light is used to reduce phase fluctuations and optical losses.

Result: Phase fluctuation angle is reduced from 14 mrad to 9 mrad, and total optical loss drops from 12% to 8%, resulting in 10.1 dB squeezed light generation.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates significant progress in generating squeezed light, achieving a record 10.1 dB squeezing with reduced phase fluctuations and optical losses, paving the way for fault-tolerant optical quantum computation.

Abstract: We report generation of 10.1\pm0.2-dB squeezed light from a broadband periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Based on our previous report where a similar PPLN waveguide shows 8.3-dB squeezing [T. Kashiwazaki et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 122, 234003 (2023)], we reduce phase fluctuations and overall optical losses in the measurement system. In particular, we introduce a novel phase detection technique that does not require tapping a part of the squeezed light to get a phase locking signal. We use a phase-detection OPA seeded by a tapped probe and pump light before a squeezer OPA. This configuration breaks the conventional trade-off between generating a phase-locking signal with high-signal-to-noise ratio and suppressing degradation of squeezing level caused by optical tapping. With all these improvements, the phase fluctuation angle is reduced from 14 mrad to 9 mrad, and the total optical loss from 12\% to 8\%. Achieving more than 10 dB of squeezing by the broadband waveguide OPA is a significant step towards realization of fault-tolerant ultra-fast universal optical quantum computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore driving protocols that minimize work in finite-time processes, particularly for quantum systems where analyses are often limited to Markovian master equations and weak-coupling regimes.

Method: Numerically exact method to analyze minimal work protocols for two-level systems coupled to a harmonic-oscillator bath, using an impulse ansatz inspired by known optimal solutions for Brownian oscillators.

Result: Impulse-like features remain nearly optimal in the quantum, non-Markovian regime at short times. The study also identifies limitations of Markovian master equations even at weak coupling.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of fully quantum approaches for finite-time thermodynamic optimization, especially in cases where Markovian master equations fail, even at weak coupling.

Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics sets a lower bound on the work required to drive a system between thermal equilibrium states, with equality attained in the quasistatic limit. For finite-time processes, part of the extractable work is inevitably dissipated, motivating the search for driving protocols that minimize the work. While classical stochastic systems have been extensively explored, quantum analyses remain limited and often rely on Markovian master equations valid only in the weak-coupling regime. Here, we study minimal work protocols for representative two-level systems coupled to a harmonic-oscillator bath using a numerically exact method. Inspired by known optimal solutions for Brownian oscillators, we introduce an impulse ansatz that incorporates possible boundary impulses and test it across a wide range of bath parameters. We find that impulse-like features remain nearly optimal in the quantum, non-Markovian regime, at short times. We also identify cases in which the widely used Markovian master equation fails even at weak coupling, underscoring the need for fully quantum approaches to finite-time thermodynamic optimization.

Motivation: To improve the accuracy and efficiency of quantum simulations by providing a variational alternative to Trotter-Suzuki decompositions, reducing errors and gate counts in quantum circuits.

Method: The paper introduces a variational ansatz derived from a global action principle, governed by Euler-Lagrange equations, to optimize time evolution operations. This method avoids costly optimizations for different initial states and outperforms traditional Trotter-Suzuki formulas.

Result: The method reduces errors by factors of 2 to 5 compared to Trotter-Suzuki decompositions, achieves higher accuracy with fewer gates, and provides analytical expressions for variational parameters up to cubic order in time.

Conclusion: The variational method proposed in this paper significantly reduces errors in quantum simulations compared to Trotter-Suzuki decompositions, achieving higher accuracy with fewer gates. It offers a practical solution for accurate and efficient quantum computing applications.

Abstract: We propose a variational alternative to the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition that provides greater control over errors while preserving the unitary structure of time evolution. The variational parameters in our ansatz are derived from a global action principle, where Euler-Lagrange equations govern their optimal dynamics. Unlike conventional wavefunction-based variational methods, our approach specifically targets the time evolution operation and this allows a single set of optimized parameters to be applied to any initial state for a fixed Hamiltonian avoiding costly optimization procedures. Our method outperforms the standard Trotter-Suzuki formulas, typically achieving higher accuracy than higher-order Suzuki schemes. This translates directly to quantum computing applications, where it enables the design of quantum circuits with fewer gates which reduces noise and improves precision. Although we focus on quantum dynamics, the method is broadly applicable to problems involving general time-evolution operators. Applied to various model Hamiltonians, our approach reduces errors by factors of 2 to 5 compared to Trotter-Suzuki decompositions, demonstrating its promise for accurate quantum simulation with improved efficiency. In certain cases, the variational ansatz achieves higher accuracy than more complex higher-order Suzuki formulas while reducing the gate count by nearly half within a single circuit layer. Furthermore, we derive approximate analytical expressions for the variational parameters up to cubic order in time, valid for generic Hamiltonians. These approximations enable long-time quantum simulations with improved accuracy over equivalent Suzuki decompositions, providing ready-to-use evolution formulas that match Suzuki's gate complexity while delivering better performance.

TL;DR: Three new techniques for characterizing rare-event performance of qLDPC codes show promising results but highlight areas for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing high-quality logical qubits is challenging due to rare logical failure events; existing methods are insufficient for qLDPC codes under circuit noise.

Method: Developed three techniques: (I) a parameterized ansatz for the failure spectrum, (II) identification of min-weight logical operators, and (III) generalized splitting method with multi-seeded Metropolis sampling for qLDPC codes.

Result: Empirical fitting of failure spectra, exact computation of min-weight failing configurations, and improved convergence for systems with many inequivalent logical operators.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates strong low-error-rate performance for distance-6, -12, and -18 bivariate bicycle codes using the Relay decoder and identifies potential for further enhancement.

Abstract: The ultimate goal of quantum error correction is to create logical qubits with very low error rates (e.g. 1e-12) and assemble them into large-scale quantum computers capable of performing many (e.g. billions) of logical gates on many (e.g. thousands) of logical qubits. However, it is necessarily difficult to directly assess the performance of such high-quality logical qubits using standard Monte Carlo sampling because logical failure events become very rare. Building on existing approaches to this problem, we develop three complementary techniques to characterize the rare-event regime for general quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes under circuit noise. (I) We propose a well-motivated, low-parameter ansatz for the failure spectrum (the fraction of fault sets of each size that fail) that empirically fits all the QEC systems we studied and predicts logical error rates at all physical error rates. (II) We find min-weight logical operators of syndrome measurement circuits and exactly compute the number of min-weight failing configurations. (III) We generalize the splitting method to qLDPC codes using multi-seeded Metropolis sampling to improve convergence for systems with many inequivalent logical operators. We apply these tools to distance-6, -12, and -18 bivariate bicycle codes under circuit noise, observing strong low-error-rate performance with the recently proposed Relay decoder but also considerable scope for further improvement.

Motivation: Addressing the security threats posed by the "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" (HNDL) attack paradigm in IoT networks, where existing solutions are either not future-proof or too resource-intensive.

Method: A hybrid framework combining quantum key distribution (QKD) with a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF) and an automated slot reservation mechanism.

Result: The protocol achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity with a communication cost of O(n^2), a significant improvement over quantum-native alternatives (O(n^4)), and quantifies trade-offs between performance and information leakage.

Conclusion: The QADR protocol provides a scalable, quantum-resistant solution for IoT security, balancing performance and anonymity. It demonstrates significant performance improvements over purely quantum alternatives, making it a benchmark for future quantum-secured systems.

Abstract: The security of future large-scale IoT networks is critically threatened by the ``Harvest Now, Decrypt Later'' (HNDL) attack paradigm. Securing the massive, long-lived data streams from these systems requires protocols that are both quantum-resistant and highly scalable. Existing solutions are insufficient: post-quantum classical protocols rely on computational assumptions that may not hold for decades, while purely quantum protocols are too resource-intensive for the sheer scale of IoT. This paper introduces the Quantum Anonymous Data Reporting (QADR) protocol, a hybrid framework that provides a theoretical benchmark and high-performance architecture for this challenge, designed for future fully-connected quantum networks. The protocol achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity through a hybrid security model; it leverages information-theoretically secure keys from Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to seed a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF), grounding its long-term data protection in well-established computational hardness assumptions. We also propose and analyze an automated slot reservation mechanism by making a deliberate trade-off: achieving high performance by accepting a quantifiable information leak during the anonymous slot reservation phase while maintaining strong unlinkability for the final data submission. Our security analysis formally quantifies the anonymity reduction caused by the leak and discusses pathways to fully mitigate it at a significant performance cost. We prove the protocol's critical advantage as a performance benchmark: its primary communication cost scales as $O(n^2)$, a dramatic improvement over quantum-native alternatives ($O(n^4)$), establishing a high-performance goal for future quantum-secured anonymity systems.

Result: The method accurately simulates degenerate SPDC, reproducing energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing, even in high-intensity regimes, achieving compression ratios above 3·10³.

Conclusion: The tensor-network approach, using MPS formalism, offers a scalable and efficient method for modeling nonlinear optical systems, achieving high compression ratios and preserving physical fidelity.

Abstract: Understanding the quantum evolution of light in nonlinear media is central to the development of next-generation quantum technologies. Yet modeling these processes remains computationally demanding, as the required resources grow rapidly with photon number and phase-space resolution. Here we introduce a tensor-network approach that efficiently captures the dynamics of nonlinear optical systems in a continuous-variable representation. Using the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, both quantum states and operators are encoded in a highly compressed form, enabling direct numerical integration of the Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate the method by simulating degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that it accurately reproduces established theoretical benchmarks - energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing - even in regimes where conventional Fock-basis simulations become infeasible. For high-intensity pump fields ($α= 100$), the MPS representation achieves compression ratios above $3\cdot 10^3$ while preserving physical fidelity. This framework opens a scalable route to modeling multimode quantum light and nonlinear optical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional methods.

Method: The paper presents an experimental method to engineer microwave driving into heat flow through a leaky resonator, utilizing thermalizing channel states generated from double dressings of the resonator.

Result: Experimental results on an Xmon qubit circuit show good agreement with analytical predictions, validating the method's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that engineered thermal baths can positively control superconducting qubits, achieving quasi-thermal equilibrium with arbitrary target temperatures rapidly.

Abstract: Although known for negatively impacting the operation of superconducting qubits, thermal baths are shown to exert qubit control in a positive way, provided they are properly engineered. We demonstrate an experimental method to engineer the transduction of microwave driving into heat flow through a leaky resonator. Given the precise conversion, a qubit receiving the heat flow obtains a quasi-thermal equilibrium with arbitrary target temperature in hundreds of nanoseconds. We show that the dynamics of the quantum transducing process is described by thermalizing channel states, generated from the double dressings of the resonator by the semi-classical driving and the qubit-resonator coupling. Their spectrum, coupling, and driving strength determine the channel rate of energy flow, along with the relaxation rates of photon leakage into the bath. The analytical prediction is shown to match well with the experimental measurements on an Xmon qubit circuit.

Conclusion: FPQE通过保持经典数据到量子态转换的保真度，为高质量的量子表示学习建立了一个可扩展且硬件高效的基础。

Abstract: Efficiently encoding classical visual data into quantum states is essential for realizing practical quantum neural networks (QNNs). However, existing encoding schemes often discard spatial and semantic information when adapting high-dimensional images to the limited qubits of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. We propose a Fidelity-Preserving Quantum Encoding (FPQE) framework that performs near lossless data compression and quantum encoding. FPQE employs a convolutional encoder-decoder to learn compact multi-channel representations capable of reconstructing the original data with high fidelity, which are then mapped into quantum states through amplitude encoding. Experimental results show that FPQE performs comparably to conventional methods on simple datasets such as MNIST, while achieving clear improvements on more complex ones, outperforming PCA and pruning based encodings by up to 10.2\% accuracy on Cifar-10. The performance gain grows with data complexity, demonstrating FPQE's ability to preserve high-level structural information across diverse visual domains. By maintaining fidelity during classical to quantum transformation, FPQE establishes a scalable and hardware efficient foundation for high-quality quantum representation learning.

Motivation: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, similar to classical networks, necessitating robust detection mechanisms.

Method: A quantum backdoor attack detection framework called QSentry is developed, incorporating a quantum Measurement Clustering method to identify statistical anomalies in measurement outputs.

Result: QSentry effectively detects backdoors, achieving high F1 scores (75.8% at 1% poisoning rate, up to 93.2% at 10%). It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: This work establishes a practical and effective framework for mitigating backdoor threats in Quantum Machine Learning (QML).

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are an important model for implementing quantum machine learning (QML), while they demonstrate a high degree of vulnerability to backdoor attacks similar to classical networks. To address this issue, a quantum backdoor attack detection framework called QSentry is proposed, in which a quantum Measurement Clustering method is introduced to detect backdoors by identifying statistical anomalies in measurement outputs. It is demonstrated that QSentry can effectively detect anomalous distributions induced by backdoor samples with extensive experiments. It achieves a 75.8% F1 score even under a 1% poisoning rate, and further improves to 85.7% and 93.2% as the poisoning rate increases to 5% and 10%, respectively. The integration of silhouette coefficients and relative cluster size enable QSentry to precisely isolate backdoor samples, yielding estimates that closely match actual poisoning ratios. Evaluations under various quantum attack scenarios demonstrate that QSentry delivers superior robustness and accuracy compared with three state-of-the-art detection methods. This work establishes a practical and effective framework for mitigating backdoor threats in QML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a novel and simplified method for generating photonic entanglement without relying on multiphoton states, leveraging resonance fluorescence from a quantum dot.

Method: The approach exploits vacuum-one-photon number superposition states created under resonant excitation from a single quantum dot, delocalizing the superposition via a beam splitter to realize time-bin entanglement.

Result: Demonstrated time-bin entanglement and observed a clear violation of the Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality using Franson-type interferometry.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a scalable pathway toward solid-state entangled photon sources, simplifying experimental requirements by eliminating the need for multiphoton generation.

Abstract: Entanglement is a central resource in quantum technologies, and the realization of photonic entanglement necessarily relies on interaction with matter. Resonance fluorescence (RF), originating from the coherent interaction between a driving field and a two-level system, plays a pivotal role in quantum optics. Here, we demonstrate a novel route to entanglement generation based on RF from a single quantum dot. Rather than relying on generation of multiphoton states, our approach directly exploits vacuum-one-photon number superposition states created under resonant excitation. By delocalizing this superposition via a beam splitter, we realize time-bin entanglement and observe a clear violation of the Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality using Franson-type interferometry. Our scheme removes the need for multiphoton generation, simplifies the experimental requirements, and establishes a scalable pathway toward solid-state entangled photon sources.

Abstract: We propose a topological transport platform for microwave-to-optical conversion at the single-photon level in a Rydberg atom-cavity setting. This setting leverages a hybrid dual-mode Jaynes-Cummings (JC) configuration, where a microwave resonator couples an optical cavity mediated by a Rydberg atom ensemble. Our scheme uniquely enables the formation of Fock-state lattices (FSLs), where photon hopping rates depend on photon numbers in individual sites. We identify an inherent zero-energy mode corresponding to the dark state of the dual-mode JC model. This enables to build a high-efficiency single-photon transducer, which realizes topologically protected photon transport between the microwave and optical modes. Crucially, we show analytically that the FSL features continuous variations of the winding number. Our work establishes a robust mechanism for efficient quantum transduction in synthetic dimensions and opens avenues for exploring topological physics with continuous winding numbers in the atom-cavity system.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks enable unconditionally secure key exchange using quantum mechanical principles. However, routing cryptographic keys across multi-hop quantum networks introduces challenges unique to quantum communication. This survey analyzes and classifies 26 routing strategies proposed between 2013 and 2024 for terrestrial, satellite, and hybrid QKD infrastructures. Dynamic, key-aware routing algorithms have been shown to reduce service rejection rates by 25-40% compared to static shortest-path methods by incorporating real-time key pool availability and link error rates. Multi-path strategies improve resilience against trusted-node compromise by distributing keys across disjoint routes, albeit with an increase in key consumption of 30-60%. SDN-based orchestration frameworks emerge as essential enablers of flexible, QoS-aware routing for hybrid networks integrating terrestrial fibers and intermittent satellite links. Critical research directions include reducing dependence on trusted nodes through quantum repeaters or post-quantum cryptography, developing standardized key management interfaces for interoperability, and adopting AI-driven predictive routing for adapting to fluctuating network states. This comprehensive synthesis of routing algorithms, performance trade-offs, and unresolved issues offers practical guidance for engineering secure, adaptable, and large-scale QKD networks capable of meeting real-world deployment demands.

Motivation: The motivation was to demonstrate the operation of optomechanical disk resonators in the quantum regime, a milestone not yet achieved despite their advancements in optomechanics.

Method: The researchers used a gigahertz-frequency mechanical breathing mode of a semiconductor disk, cooled in a dilution refrigerator, to achieve excitation below a single phonon. Brillouin sideband spectroscopy was employed to quantify the phonon occupancy, with a conical optical fiber evanescently coupled to the disk's optical whispering-gallery mode.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrated the first experimental preparation of an optomechanical disk resonator in the quantum ground state, achieving a phonon occupancy of 0.66±0.20. However, laser-induced heating was identified as a limiting factor for further reducing the phonon occupancy.

Abstract: Although they have enabled several advances in the field of optomechanics, optomechanical disk resonators have not yet been operated in the quantum regime. We present the first experimental demonstration of an optomechanical disk resonator prepared in the quantum ground state. With a gigahertz frequency, the mechanical breathing mode of the investigated semiconductor disk reaches a level of excitation below a single phonon when cooled in a dilution refrigerator. We quantify the phonon occupancy of the mechanical mode by performing Brillouin sideband spectroscopy: a conical optical fiber is evanescently coupled to the disk optical whispering-gallery mode, and Stokes and anti-Stokes photons scattered by phonon emission and absorption are counted on a single-photon detector. We measure a suppression of the absorption process corresponding to a phonon occupancy of $0.66\pm0.20$. We experimentally investigate the mechanisms ruling laser-induced heating, which limits the lowest measurable phonon occupancy, and notably witness an extra-cavity heating effect.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend stochastic unravelings beyond master equations preserving Hermiticity and trace, enabling simulation of a wider range of open system dynamics.

Method: General framework extending piecewise-deterministic unravelings to arbitrary trace-nonpreserving master equations, requiring only positivity and Hermiticity.

Result: The framework is suitable for trace-decreasing and trace-increasing processes, compatible with various unraveling schemes and non-Markovian dynamics.

Conclusion: The introduced framework is a versatile simulation method that broadens the applicability of stochastic techniques for open system dynamics.

Abstract: Stochastic unravelings allow to efficiently simulate open system dynamics, yet their application has traditionally been restricted to master equations that preserve both Hermiticity and trace. In this work, we introduce a general framework that extends piecewise-deterministic unravelings to arbitrary trace-nonpreserving master equations, requiring only positivity and Hermiticity of the dynamics. Our approach includes, as special cases, unravelings of arbitrary dynamics in the Heisenberg picture, evolutions interpolating between fully Lindblad and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian generators, and equations employed in the derivation of full counting statistics, for which we show it can be used to obtain the moments of the associated probability distribution. The framework is suitable for both trace-decreasing and trace-increasing processes through stochastic disappearance and replication of the stochastic realizations, and it is compatible with different unraveling schemes and with reverse jumps in the non-Markovian regime. Thereby, our approach provides a powerful and versatile simulation method that significantly broadens the applicability of stochastic techniques for open system dynamics.

Abstract: As quantum networks evolve toward a full quantum Internet, reliable transmission in quantum multiple-input multiple-output (QuMIMO) settings becomes essential, yet remains difficult due to noise, crosstalk, and the mixing of quantum information across subchannels. To improve reliability in such settings, we study an adaptive diversity strategy for discrete-variable QuMIMO systems based on universal asymmetric cloning at the transmitter and probabilistic purification at the receiver. An input qubit is encoded into M approximate clones, transmitted over an N x N multi-mode quantum channel, and recovered through a purification map optimized using available channel state information (CSI). For the given cloning asymmetry parameters, we derive an eigenvalue-based expression for the decoder-optimal end-to-end fidelity in the form of a generalized Rayleigh quotient, which enables efficient tuning of the cloner without iterative optimization. As a design choice, we employ semidefinite program (SDP) to construct the purification map for only a targeted success probability p. This numerical framework is used to study fixed-noise, dimension-scaling noise, and stochastic depolarization regimes. A cloning asymmetry index is introduced to quantify the distribution of quantum information across the multiple subchannels across these operating conditions. The results show that the proposed scheme yields significant fidelity gains in crosstalk-dominated settings and automatically adapts to channel symmetry and channel conditions. This work provides design guidelines for future QuMIMO systems and establishes a robust baseline for more advanced transmission and decoding strategies.

Motivation: To address the inefficiency of quantum algorithms that encode constraints as soft penalties, specifically targeting the multi-frequency antenna placement problem in telecommunications.

Method: The authors introduce a constraint-preserving QAA by constructing a quantum circuit that initializes feasible solutions and employs a custom mixer to preserve constraints. The algorithm is extended to large problem sizes using the SPLIT framework.

Result: The constraint-preserving QAA exhibits superior feasibility and success probability compared to basic QAA and performs competitively against classical approaches for large problem sizes.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the constraint-preserving quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA) outperforms basic QAA and shows competitive performance against classical methods like branch-and-bound and simulated annealing, emphasizing the importance of constraint-aware quantum algorithms for industrial applications.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization typically encode constraints as soft penalties within the objective function, which can reduce efficiency and scalability compared to state-of-the-art classical methods that instead exploit constraints to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Although solving this issue for an arbitrary problem is inherently a hard task, we address this challenge for a specific problem in the field of telecommunications, the multi-frequency antenna placement problem, by introducing a constraint-preserving quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA). To this aim, we construct a quantum circuit that prepares an initial state comprising an equal superposition of all feasible solutions, and define a custom mixer that preserves both the one-hot encoding constraint for vertex coloring and the cardinality constraint on the number of antennas. This scheme can be extended to a broader range of applications characterized by similar constraints. We first benchmark the performance of this quantum algorithm against a basic version of QAA, demonstrating superior performance in terms of feasibility and success probability. We then apply this algorithm to large problem sizes with hundreds of variables using a constraint-aware decomposition method based on the SPLIT framework. Our results indicate competitive performance against other large-scale classical approaches, such as branch-and-bound and simulated annealing. This work supports previous claims that constraint-aware algorithms are crucial for the practical and efficient application of quantum methods in industrial settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task scheduling with constrained time intervals and limited resources is a fundamental challenge in domains like manufacturing, logistics, cloud computing, and healthcare. The paper aims to address this challenge by leveraging quantum optimization.

Method: The study proposes QTIS, a variant of QAOA, which integrates an ancilla-assisted quantum circuit to dynamically detect and penalize overlapping tasks. Two overlap detection implementations are explored: a quantum approach (RY rotations and CCNOT gates) and a classical alternative. QTIS decomposes the problem Hamiltonian into two parameterized components for encoding the objective function and penalty terms. Three minimization strategies (standard QAOA, T-QAOA, HT-QAOA) are evaluated.

Result: Results indicate that QTIS, with separate parameters for different Hamiltonian components, achieves lower energy values and improved solution quality compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: QTIS demonstrates efficiency in scheduling tasks with fixed temporal windows while minimizing conflicts, showcasing its potential in hybrid quantum-classical optimization for complex scheduling environments.

Abstract: Task scheduling with constrained time intervals and limited resources remains a fundamental challenge across domains such as manufacturing, logistics, cloud computing, and healthcare. This study presents a novel variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) designed to address the task scheduling problem formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. The proposed method, referred to as Quantum Time Interval Scheduler (QTIS), integrates an ancilla-assisted quantum circuit to dynamically detect and penalize overlapping tasks, enhancing the enforcement of scheduling constraints. Two complementary implementations are explored for overlap detection: a quantum approach based on RY rotations and CCNOT gates, and a classical alternative relying on preprocessed interval comparisons. QTIS decomposes the problem Hamiltonian, Hp, into two components, each parameterized by a distinct angle. The first component encodes the objective function, while the second captures penalty terms associated with overlapping intervals, which are controlled by the auxiliary circuit. Subsequently, three minimization strategies are evaluated: standard QAOA, T-QAOA, and HT-QAOA, showing that employing separate parameters for the different components of the problem Hamiltonian leads to lower energy values and improved solution quality. Results confirm the efficiency of QTIS in scheduling tasks with fixed temporal windows while minimizing conflicts, demonstrating its potential to advance hybrid quantum-classical optimization in complex scheduling environments.

Abstract: Long distance entanglement generation at a high rate is a major quantum technological goal yet to be fully realized, with the promise of many interesting applications, such as secure quantum computing on remote servers and quantum cryptography. One possible implementation is using a variant of the DLCZ-scheme by combining atomic-ensemble memories and linear optics with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. As we edge closer to the realization of such a technology, the complete details of the underlying components become crucial. In this paper we consider the impact of the multimode emission from the SPDC source on quantum repeaters based on the DLCZ-scheme. We consider two cases, driving the SPDC using short Gaussian pulses and continuously. For pulsed driving, we find that the use of very narrow laser pulses to drive SPDC source is crucial to obtain high fidelity end-to-end entangled states but this puts demands on the peak intensity. By introducing a maximally allowed laser intensity, we find optimal pulse widths for each swap depth. For continuous driving, we find the temporal acceptance window of clicks relative to the heralding time to be a crucial parameter, and we can similarly optimize the acceptance window for each swap depth. For both cases, we thus identify optimal parameters given experimental limitations and aims. We have thus provided helpful knowledge towards the realization of long distance entanglement generation using the DLCZ-scheme.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the binding energy and electron-hole (e-h) overlap of excitonic states confined at the interface between two-dimensional materials with type-II band alignment, i.e., with lowest conduction and highest valence band edges placed in different materials, arranged in a side-by-side planar heterostructure. We propose a variational procedure within the effective mass approximation to calculate the exciton ground state and apply our model to a monolayer MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ heterostructure. The role of nonabrupt interfaces between the materials is accounted for in our model by assuming a W$_x$Mo$_{1-x}$S$_2$ alloy around the interfacial region. Our results demonstrate that (i) interface-bound excitons are energetically favorable only for small interface thickness and/or for systems under high dielectric screening by the materials surrounding the monolayer, and that (ii) the interface exciton binding energy and its e-h overlap are controllable by the interface width and dielectric environment.

Conclusion: Quantum oscillation spectroscopy is established as a robust and broadly applicable probe of strain-induced gauge fields in Dirac materials, enabling mechanically tunable valleytronic and straintronic devices.

Abstract: Nonuniform strain in graphene acts as a valley-dependent gauge field, generating pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs) that mimic real magnetic fields but preserve global time-reversal symmetry. While local probes have visualized such fields, their quantitative detection via macroscopic transport has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that high-mobility graphene exhibits distinct beating patterns in Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, arising from valley-resolved Landau quantization under different effective magnetic fields. Systematic analysis of these beats reveals universal quadratic and linear scaling of the node carrier density and Landau level filling factor with the applied magnetic field, enabling the extraction of PMFs as small as a few millitesla. Our results establish quantum oscillation spectroscopy as a robust and broadly applicable probe of strain-induced gauge fields in Dirac materials, opening avenues for mechanically tunable valleytronic and straintronic devices.

Result: Identified light-controlled topological transitions leading to various phases (S-QHI, QVH, P-QHI) based on Floquet coupling strength and electric-field parameter.

Conclusion: 1T′--MoS₂ is established as a tunable platform for selectively manipulating spin and valley degrees of freedom through circular driving, enabling controlled access to non-equilibrium topological phases in transition-metal dichalcogenides.

Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium topological phases of monolayer 1T$^\prime$--MoS$_2$ under high-frequency circularly polarized driving using a low-energy $k\!\cdot\!p$ Hamiltonian combined with a van Vleck expansion. The off-resonant field generates spin- and valley-dependent mass corrections that reshape the Berry curvature profile and shift the conditions for band inversion. By evaluating the quasienergy bands, Berry curvatures, Hall conductivities, and spin- valley-resolved Chern numbers, we identify a sequence of light-controlled topological transitions marked by well-defined gap closings. Depending on the Floquet coupling strength and the electric-field parameter, the system evolves between the equilibrium quantum spin Hall (QSH) state and a set of driven phases including spin-polarized quantum Hall insulator (S-QHI), quantum valley Hall (QVH or BI) and photo-induced quantum Hall insulator (P-QHI) regimes. The results establish 1T$^\prime$--MoS$_2$ as a tunable platform where circular driving selectively manipulates spin and valley degrees of freedom, enabling controlled access to non-equilibrium topological phases in transition-metal dichalcogenides.

Abstract: We introduce a new mechanism that produces a Hall-like response in time-reversal-invariant materials, driven entirely by geometric effects. Specifically, we demonstrate that a tilted potential interface causes electron wave packets to undergo a refraction-like deflection upon transmission through the barrier, leading to a finite transverse current and a corresponding Hall conductance. Our analytical framework captures the essential features of this refraction Hall effect, and the resulting Hall conductivity profile is corroborated by numerical simulations across different lattice models and device geometries. We further visualize our predicted effect through real-time wave packet dynamics, which reveals its purely geometric origin and the robustness of the transverse response. These findings establish a fundamentally distinct class of Hall-like transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems that preserve time-reversal symmetry.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origins of shape anisotropy on the mesoscopic scale in magnetic metamaterials.

Method: Combining a physically realistic stray-field potential with the spatial dimensionality of the system to reduce the effective dimensionality of classical magnetic mesospins.

Result: The study shows how stray-field potential and spatial dimensionality reduce the effective dimensionality of mesospins, leading to emergent constraints on the magnetic excitation spectrum and long-range order.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates a rare case in one-dimensional systems where long-range order persists at finite temperatures, highlighting the unique role of stray-field potential and spatial dimensionality.

Abstract: We present a rare example of a one-dimensional system with short-range range interactions for which a self-stabilizing long-range ordered phase persists to finite temperatures. Our model offers a new perspective on the origins of shape anisotropy on the mesoscopic scale in magnetic metamaterials. Specifically, we show how the combination of a physically realistic stray-field potential and the spatial dimensionality of the system can reduce the effective dimensionality of classical magnetic mesospins. The resulting emergent constraints on the magnetic excitation spectrum underpin the observed ordering, in stark contrast to the behaviour of analogous one-dimensional models with strictly isotropic spins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms of how single and multi-shelled carbon nanotubes break apart under energetic ion irradiation.

Method: Experimental irradiation of carbon nanotubes with Cs ions, followed by analysis using Shannon entropy, fractal dimension, and Kullback-Leibler divergence.

Result: Experimental results support theoretical models, and information-theoretic approaches provide additional insights into the fragmentation mechanisms.

Conclusion: The study combines thermal and information-theoretic models to clarify and distinguish the roles of collision cascades and thermal spikes in the fragmentation of carbon nanotubes.

Abstract: Energetic ion irradiation is an effective method for studying how single and multi-shelled carbon nanotubes break apart. The energy from ions is dissipated through both linear and nonlinear processes in the nanotubes, leading to defect formation. Fragmentation occurs via atomic collision cascades and thermal spikes, each described by different theoretical models. Experiments with Cs-irradiated nanotubes support these models, and an information-theoretic approach further explains the fragmentation mechanisms. Sputtered species yield probability distributions, which are analyzed using Shannon entropy and fractal dimension to assess spatial characteristics. Kullback-Leibler divergence helps identify the diversity of emission mechanisms. Together, thermal and information-theoretic models clarify and distinguish the roles of collision cascades and thermal spikes in nanotube fragmentation.

TL;DR: A scalable method for creating uniform, long-range ordered magnetic metamaterials by embedding iron-ions in palladium, avoiding lithographic disorder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of realizing large-area magnetic metamaterials with high morphological uniformity and intrinsic long-range order, avoiding the structural disorder inherent to lithographic fabrication.

Method: The authors used controlled implantation of iron-ions into a non-magnetic palladium host matrix to create morphologically uniform arrays that spontaneously develop extended antiferromagnetic order.

Result: The study successfully demonstrated structurally and magnetically coherent metamaterials with long-range antiferromagnetic order, as evidenced by resonant X-ray scattering and microscopy.

Conclusion: This work establishes a platform for exploring coherent spin-photon interactions and functional X-ray scattering in magnetic metamaterials, free from lithographic topography and disorder.

Abstract: Engineered assemblies of interacting magnetic elements-magnetic metamaterials-provide a powerful route to tailor collective magnetic order and dynamics. By structuring matter at the mesoscale, they bridge atomic magnetism and macroscopic functionality, enabling emergent behaviour inaccessible in conventional materials. However, realizing large-area metamaterials that combine high morphological uniformity with intrinsic long-range order has remained challenging, largely due to the structural disorder inherent to lithographic fabrication. Here we demonstrate a scalable route to structurally and magnetically coherent metamaterials by embedding iron-ions to form mesospins within a non-magnetic thin film palladium host matrix. Using controlled implantation, we realize morphologically uniform arrays that spontaneously develop extended antiferromagnetic order in the as-fabricated state - without the need of external annealing or field cycling. Resonant X-ray scattering and microscopy reveal sharp magnetic Bragg peaks modulated by the mesospin form factor, evidencing long-range antiferromagnetic order coupled to structural coherence. This embedded architecture establishes a platform for exploring coherent spin-photon interactions and functional X-ray scattering in magnetic metamaterials free from lithographic topography and disorder.

TL;DR: A model shows heavy doping reduces Auger recombination but fails at high doping levels; indium in hole injectors is less effective than doping for ICL optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how injector region design in interband cascade lasers (ICLs) affects threshold carrier and current densities.

Method: Combines an 8-band k·p calculation, electrostatics, and microscopic Auger recombination rate calculations, including carrier-carrier scattering in the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism.

Result: Heavy doping in the electron injector suppresses dominant multi-hole Auger recombination but is insufficient to explain threshold current increases at high doping. Indium addition to GaSb hole injector wells does not outperform doping.

Conclusion: The model provides physical insights for optimizing ICL carrier injectors, highlighting the limitations and trade-offs of doping and hole injector design.

Abstract: We investigate theoretically how the injector region design of interband cascade lasers (ICLs) impacts the threshold carrier and current densities. The model combines a polarization-sensitive 8-band $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathrm{p}$ calculation, electrostatics, and a microscopic calculation of Auger recombination rates. The carrier-carrier scattering is included to lowest order within the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism. It captures the combined effects of charge carrier redistribution, parasitic absorption and bias voltage on the Auger recombination rate. We show that heavily doping the electron injector suppresses the dominant multi-hole Auger recombination by reducing the hole population of the recombination quantum wells. This agrees with the experimental observation that the heavy doping reduces threshold currents. Yet, our model suggests that the Auger recombination alone is not sufficient to explain the increase of threshold currents at high doping concentrations. Furthermore, by introducing indium to the conventional GaSb hole injector wells, we explain the rule of thumb from experiments that raising the hole injector levels does not outperform the doping strategy. Our model provides physical insights toward optimization of ICL carrier injectors.

TL;DR: Study on when GKBA fails in electron-phonon dynamics, identifying stability bounds and showing how coupling to leads can mitigate instabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to balance accuracy and computational cost in predicting real-time dynamics for correlated systems, where GKBA's time-linear propagation may lead to uncontrolled behavior.

Method: Examination of the Holstein dimer model with a conserving, fully self-consistent electron-phonon self-energy to analyze GKBA dynamics.

Result: Mapping of parameter regions where GKBA is stable and unstable, tracing failures to changes in ground-state solutions from nonequilibrium Green's function theory.

Conclusion: The study provides practical stability bounds for GKBA simulations in electron-phonon systems and demonstrates that coupling to electronic leads can mitigate instabilities.

Abstract: Predicting real-time dynamics in correlated systems is demanding: exact two-time Green's function methods are accurate but often too costly, while the Generalized Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz (GKBA) offers time-linear propagation at the risk of uncontrolled behavior. We examine when and why GKBA fails in a minimal yet informative setting, the Holstein dimer that describes electron-phonon coupling. Using a conserving, fully self-consistent electron-phonon self-energy, we map out parameter regions where GKBA dynamics is stable and where it becomes unstable. We trace the onset of these failures to qualitative changes in the model's ground-state solutions obtained from the full nonequilibrium Green's function theory, thereby providing practical stability bounds for GKBA time evolution. We further show that coupling the dimer to electronic leads can damp and, in part, cure these instabilities. The results supply simple diagnostics and guidelines for reliable GKBA simulations of electron-phonon dynamics.
