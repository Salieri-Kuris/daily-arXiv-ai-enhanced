### [1] [Effects of Non-reciprocity on Coupled Kuramoto Oscillators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15845)
*Shaon Mandal Chakraborty,Bibhut Sahoo,Rituparno Mandal,Peter Sollich*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Non-reciprocal interactions in coupled oscillators change chimera states and introduce new dynamic behaviors like traveling chimeras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of non-reciprocal interactions in macroscopic systems, particularly in relation to chimera states, which break into synchronous and asynchronous groups.

Method: The study explores a non-reciprocal version of the Kuramoto model to analyze the effects of non-reciprocity on chimera states.

Result: Non-reciprocity alters the chimera state diagram and leads to new dynamical states, such as traveling chimera, run-and-chase, and coexistence phases.

Conclusion: Non-reciprocal interactions significantly alter the state diagram of chimera states in coupled oscillators and introduce new dynamical states, highlighting their profound impact beyond reciprocal interactions.

Abstract: All the fundamental interactions (such as gravity or electromagnetic interactions) are reciprocal in nature. However, in the macroscopic world, in particular outside equilibrium, non-reciprocal or non-mutual interactions are quite ubiquitous. Understanding the impact of such non-reciprocal interactions has drawn a significant amount of interest in physics and other fields of sciences in recent years. We explore a non-reciprocal version of coupled oscillators (known as the Kuramoto model) with the aim of understanding the role of non-reciprocity, particularly in relation to chimera states, where oscillators spontaneously break into mutually synchronous and asynchronous groups. Our findings suggest that non-reciprocity not only alters the state diagram of the chimera state significantly but can also lead to new dynamical states, such as traveling chimera, run-and-chase and coexistence phases.

### [2] [Boltzmann-Kolmogorov equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15901)
*Mário J. de Oliveira*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The Kolmogorov equation models isolated/open systems, predicts entropy increase, and under approximation, leads to the Boltzmann equation, differing from the Liouville equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the properties of the Kolmogorov equation in describing both isolated and open systems, contrasting it with the Liouville equation.

Method: The study uses approximations where the distribution is a product of one-particle distributions to derive the Boltzmann equation.

Result: The Kolmogorov equation predicts entropy increase and can model equilibrium and nonequilibrium states, deriving the Boltzmann equation under specific approximations.

Conclusion: The Kolmogorov equation extends to open systems, capturing both equilibrium (Gibbs canonical distribution) and nonequilibrium steady states, unlike the Liouville equation.

Abstract: We investigate the properties of a Kolmogorov equation governing the time evolution of the probability distribution defined in phase space. Energy is strictly conserved along a trajectory in phase space, meaning the equation is appropriate to describe an isolated system, and the stationary state is the Gibbs microcanonical distribution. The equation predicts the increase in entropy in agreement with thermodynamics, and in contrast with the Liouville equation, which conserves entropy. Using an approximation in which the distribution is a product of one-particle distributions, we derive the Boltzmann equation of kinetic theory. We also consider a Kolmogorov equation to describe an open system in contact with the external environment. In this case the equation describes not only the situation in which the system is found in thermodynamic equilibrium with a Gibbs canonical distribution in the stationary state, but also the nonequilibrium steady state with a continuous production of entropy.

*Annika Vonhusen,Sören Schweers,Artem Ryabov,Philipp Maass*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: A nonequilibrium phase transition in crowded, periodic structures separates weak-current and high-current phases, with critical density thresholds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify novel emergent states and phases of collective dynamics in crowded and confining environments.

Method: Studied driven particle transport in periodic structures at high particle densities, analyzing transitions between phases.

Result: Observation of a nonequilibrium phase transition separating weak-current and high-current phases, reflected in changes of universality classes for current fluctuations.

Conclusion: Sudden changes to high current states can occur when increasing particle densities beyond critical values, as demonstrated by the observed phase transition.

Abstract: Driven particle transport in crowded and confining environments is fundamental to diverse phenomena across physics, chemistry, and biology. A main objective in studying such systems is to identify novel emergent states and phases of collective dynamics. Here, we report on a nonequilibrium phase transition occurring in periodic structures at high particle densities. This transition separates a weak-current phase of thermally activated transport from a high-current phase of solitary wave propagation. It is reflected also in a change of universality classes characterizing correlations of particle current fluctuations. Our findings demonstrate that sudden changes to high current states can occur when increasing particle densities beyond critical values.

### [4] [Collective Buckling in Metal-Organic Framework Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16286)
*Nico Hahn,Lars Öhrström,R. Matthias Geilhufe*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for collective buckling in MOFs is developed, analyzing phase transitions and strain effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To describe and analyze collective buckling in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) under strain.

Method: Developed a model based on a buckling coordinate with an effective double-well potential and dipole-dipole interactions, analyzed via mean-field approximation.

Result: Determined the critical temperature for phase transitions and applied the theory to MOF-5 under uniaxial strain.

Conclusion: The framework enables a quantitative description of collective buckling in MOFs, providing insights into phase transitions under strain.

Abstract: We develop a framework to describe collective buckling in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Starting from the microscopic structure of a single organic linker, we define a buckling coordinate governed by an effective double-well potential. Coupling between linkers arises from dipole-dipole interactions, leading to a lattice Hamiltonian. We analyze the transition between ordered and disordered phases within a mean-field approximation and determine the critical temperature. As an example for our theory, we discuss the collective buckling instability for the prototypical cubic framework MOF-5 under different values of uniaxial strain. Our approach enables a quantitative description of collective buckling in framework materials.

### [5] [Resolving Speed and Encoding Bottlenecks in Fast Heteromeric Self-Assembly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16362)
*Félix Benoist,Pablo Sartori*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: A study using a heteropolymer growth model shows that kinetically controlling key binding events helps overcome bottlenecks in cytoplasmic self-assembly, explaining the timely formation of protein structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how cytoplasmic self-assembly achieves high accuracy and speed despite pervasive thermal fluctuations and shared components among different structures.

Method: The authors extend a heteropolymer growth model to describe the retrieval of two-dimensional structures, analyzing the effects of connectivity and kinetic control on self-assembly.

Result: The self-assembly is subject to strong speed and encoding bottlenecks, but these can be suppressed by increasing the connectivity of a small fraction of components.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that kinetically controlling a small number of critical binding events can suppress speed and encoding bottlenecks in cytoplasmic self-assembly, providing a unifying principle for the role of assembly factors.

Abstract: The cytoplasm is a heterogeneous mixture containing many types of proteins that self-assemble into a wide variety of complexes. The accuracy and speed of cytoplasmic self-assembly is astonishing because it involves the correct identification of components shared among different structures, despite pervasive thermal fluctuations. Typical toy models of self-assembly are based on the specificity of binding energies among components and neglect kinetic effects. However, kinetics plays a key role in biological self-assembly, often catalyzed by a plethora of assembly factors. Building on this observation, we extend a previous heteropolymer growth model to describe the retrieval of two-dimensional structures. We find that the self-assembly of structures in this model is subject to strong speed and encoding bottlenecks. Moreover, we show that these bottlenecks can be suppressed by increasing the connectivity of a small fraction of components. This mechanism of kinetically controlling a small number of critical binding events provides a simple explanation for the timely assembly of large protein, and suggests a unifying principle for the role of assembly factors.

*Tuuli Sillanpää,Sanni Nousiainen,Lasse Laurson*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: 弹性界面在临界脱钉时的局部高度分布呈现负偏态性，这一现象在热力学极限和不同弹簧刚度下均稳健


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究弹性界面在临界脱钉转变中高度分布的偏态性及其演化

Method: 通过局部、长程和完全耦合（平均场）弹性模型

Result: 高度分布在接近临界力时从正偏态迅速转变为负偏态

Conclusion: 分布演化的负偏态性是弹性界面在淬火随机介质中临界脱钉转变的稳健特征

Abstract: Elastic interfaces in quenched random media driven by external forces exhibit a continuous depinning phase transition between pinned and moving phases at a critical external force. Recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 175701 (2022)] has shown that the distribution of local interface heights at depinning displays negative skewness. Here, by considering local, long-range and fully-coupled (mean-field) elasticity, we expand on this result by demonstrating the robustness of the negative skewness at depinning when approaching the thermodynamic limit and considering different values of the spring stiffness controlling the avalanche cutoff. Additionally, we investigate the evolution of the height distribution as the external force is ramped up from zero, approaching the critical force from below. Starting from a symmetric height distribution at zero force, the distribution initially develops positive skewness increasing with the external force, followed by a steep drop to the negative value characteristic of the critical point as the depinning transition is reached.

### [7] [Distinguishing thermal versus quantum annealing using probability-flux signatures across interaction networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16457)
*Yoshiaki Horiike,Yuki Kawaguchi*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper compares thermal and quantum annealing in Ising spin systems, finding structural energy landscape differences due to quantum tunnelling, with potential applications in optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the incomplete understanding of thermal and quantum annealing and enable fair comparisons between the two methods by examining their dynamics in Ising spin systems.

Method: The research investigates many-body dynamics of thermal and quantum annealing by analyzing all possible interaction networks of ±J Ising spin systems up to seven spins. Probability fluxes in state space are used to identify microscopic differences.

Result: Differences between thermal and quantum annealing are identified for specific interaction networks, with quantum tunnelling being a key differentiator. The findings are experimentally verifiable and applicable to optimization problems.

Conclusion: The study reveals that differences between thermal and quantum annealing emerge based on the structure of the energy landscape, with quantum tunnelling introducing qualitative distinctions. These insights can improve optimization problem mappings to Ising spin systems, potentially enhancing simulated annealing efficiency for real-world applications.

Abstract: Simulated annealing provides a heuristic solution to combinatorial optimization problems. The cost function of a problem is mapped to the energy function of a physical many-body system, and, using thermal or quantum fluctuations, the system explores the state space to find the ground state, which may correspond to the optimal solution of the problem. Studies have highlighted both the similarities and differences between thermal and quantum fluctuations. Nevertheless, fundamental understanding of thermal and quantum annealing remains incomplete, making it difficult to design problem instances that fairly compare the two methods. Here, we investigate the many-body dynamics of thermal and quantum annealing by examining all possible interaction networks of $\pm J$ Ising spin systems up to seven spins. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that differences between thermal and quantum annealing emerge for particular interaction networks, indicating that the structure of the energy landscape distinguishes the two dynamics. We identify the microscopic origin of these differences through probability fluxes in state space, finding that the two dynamics are broadly similar but that quantum tunnelling produces qualitative differences. Our results provide insight into how thermal and quantum fluctuations navigate a system toward the ground state in simulated annealing, and are experimentally verifiable in atomic, molecular, and optical systems. Furthermore, these insights may improve mappings of optimization problems to Ising spin systems, yielding more accurate solutions in faster simulated annealing and thus benefiting real-world applications in industry. Our comprehensive survey of interaction networks and visualization of probability flux can help to understand, predict, and control quantum advantage in quantum annealing.

### [8] [Comment on: "Scaling and Universality at Noisy Quench Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16509)
*J. Sirker*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The comment refutes the claim that DQPTs persist under noise in a two-band model, proving they cannot exist for non-zero noise due to mixed states from averaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the claim in Ref. Ansari et al. that dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) persist in the presence of noise for a two-band model, and to provide a counter-proof.

Method: The authors use rigorous mathematical proof to analyze the conditions under which the Loschmidt echo can be zero. They also investigate alternative natural ways to average over noise realizations.

Result: The comment shows that DQPTs cannot exist in the considered scenario for non-zero noise, as the averaging process leads to mixed states. Alternative averaging methods also smooth out DQPTs.

Conclusion: The comment rigorously proves that in any two-dimensional Hilbert space, the Loschmidt echo of two density matrices can only become zero if both density matrices are pure. This rules out the existence of dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in the considered scenario for non-zero noise.

Abstract: In Ref. Ansari et al., dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) -- non-analyticities in the Loschmidt return rate at critical times -- are investigated in the presence of noise for a two-band model. The authors report that DQPTs persist even after averaging over the noise and they use their results to derive dynamical phase diagrams. In this comment we rigorously prove that in any two-dimensional Hilbert space the Loschmidt echo of two density matrices can only become zero if and only if both density matrices are pure. As a consequence, the existence of DQPTs in the considered scenario is strictly ruled out for non-zero noise because the considered averaging leads to a mixed state. We also investigate alternative natural ways to average over noise realizations and show that in all of them DQPTs are smoothed out.

### [9] [Out-of-equilibrium spinodal-like scaling behaviors at the thermal first-order transitions of three-dimensional q-state Potts models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16510)
*Andrea Pelissetto,Davide Rossini,Ettore Vicari*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Study of out-of-equilibrium dynamics in 3D q-state Potts systems reveals a scaling behavior with κ≈3/2 and a spinodal-like phenomenon near the transition point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of first-order phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit, specifically focusing on the scaling behavior and spinodal-like phenomena in three-dimensional q-state Potts systems.

Method: The research employs a relaxational (heat-bath) dynamics to drive the system across its thermal first-order transition, with the inverse temperature β increasing linearly with time. The dynamics starts from disordered configurations and ends in an ordered state, following a Kibble-Zurek protocol.

Result: The time-dependent energy density exhibits an out-of-equilibrium scaling behavior in the large-t_s limit, with an exponent κ≈3/2, consistent with the assumption that initial nucleation of ordered regions drives the phase transition. The spinodal-like passage occurs at δβ_*∝1/(ln t_s)^{3/2}.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the out-of-equilibrium spinodal-like dynamics in three-dimensional q-state Potts systems, showing a scaling behavior in the energy density and revealing a spinodal-like phenomenon near the transition point, with the passage to the ordered phase occurring at δβ(t)=δβ_*>0.

Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium spinodal-like dynamics of three-dimensional $q$-state Potts systems driven across their thermal first-order transition in the thermodynamic limit, by a relaxational (heat-bath) dynamics. During the evolution, the inverse temperature $β$ increases linearly with time, as $δβ(t)\equiv β(t)- β_{\rm fo} \sim t/t_s$, where $β_{\rm fo}$ is the inverse temperature at the transition point, $t$ is the time and $t_s$ is a time scale. The dynamics starts at $t_i< 0$ from an ensemble of disordered configurations equilibrated at inverse temperature $β(t_i)<β_{\rm fo}$ and ends at positive values of $t$, when the system is ordered (this is analogous to a standard Kibble-Zurek protocol). The time-dependent energy density shows an out-of-equilibrium scaling behavior in the large-$t_s$ limit, in terms of the scaling variable $t(\ln t)^κ/t_s$. The corresponding exponent turns out to be consistent with $κ=3/2$ (with a good accuracy), which is the value obtained by assuming that the initial nucleation of ordered regions provides the relevant mechanism for the passage from one phase to the other. The scaling behavior implies a spinodal-like phenomenon close to the transition point: the passage from the disordered to the ordered phase, composed of large ordered regions of different color, occurs at $δβ(t)=δβ_*>0$, where $δβ_*$ decreases as $1/(\ln t_s)^{3/2}$ in the large-$t_s$ limit.

### [10] [Automorphism in Gauge Theories: Higher Symmetries and Transversal Non-Clifford Logical Gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15783)
*Po-Shen Hsin,Ryohei Kobayashi*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explores how automorphism symmetries in gauge theories can evolve into higher group or non-invertible symmetries, with applications in quantum codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the symmetries induced by gauge group automorphisms and their potential to extend or transform into higher group or non-invertible symmetries, with implications for quantum computation.

Method: The research analyzes gauge theories with nontrivial topological actions in various spacetime dimensions, focusing on automorphism-induced symmetries. It employs field theory models and lattice-based examples to illustrate findings.

Result: Automation symmetry can extend, form higher group symmetries, or become non-invertible. Specific examples include constructing transversal non-Clifford logical gates in topological quantum codes, particularly for 2+1d $ℤ_N$ qudit Clifford stabilizer models.

Conclusion: The study reveals that automorphism symmetries in gauge theories can extend, form higher group symmetries, or become non-invertible symmetries, with practical applications in constructing transversal non-Clifford logical gates in topological quantum codes.

Abstract: Gauge theories are important descriptions for many physical phenomena and systems in quantum computation. Automorphism of gauge group naturally gives global symmetries of gauge theories. In this work we study such symmetries in gauge theories induced by automorphisms of the gauge group, when the gauge theories have nontrivial topological actions in different spacetime dimensions. We discover the automorphism symmetry can be extended, become a higher group symmetry, and/or become a non-invertible symmetry. We illustrate the discussion with various models in field theory and on the lattice. In particular, we use automorphism symmetry to construct new transversal non-Clifford logical gates in topological quantum codes. In particular, we show that 2+1d $\mathbb{Z}_N$ qudit Clifford stabilizer models can implement non-Clifford transversal logical gate in the 4th level $\mathbb{Z}_N$ qudit Clifford hierarchy for $N\geq 3$, extending the generalized Bravyi-König bound proposed in the companion paper [arXiv:2511.02900] for qubits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the thermodynamic properties and magnetoelastic behavior of the proximate Kitaev magnet α-RuCl₃ under a magnetic field.

Method: Extended spin-1/2 J-K-Γ model with documented exchange and magnetoelastic coupling parameters was used to calculate internal energy, specific heat, magnetization, and linear magnetostriction coefficient.

Result: The magnetostriction coefficient exhibits a dip-like feature, correlating with the suppression of magnetic order in α-RuCl₃ under temperature and field variations.

Conclusion: The numerical linked cluster expansion (NLCE) has been successfully applied to study the thermodynamic properties and magnetoelastic features of α-RuCl₃, demonstrating its utility as a tool for quantum magnets research.

Abstract: We apply the numerical linked cluster expansion (NLCE) to study thermodynamic properties of the proximate Kitaev magnet $α$-RuCl$_3$ on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a magnetic field. Using the extended spin-1/2 $J$-$K$-$Γ$ model and based on documented exchange and magnetoelastic coupling parameters, we present results for the internal energy, the specific heat, and the magnetization. Moreover, the linear magnetostriction coefficient perpendicular to the plane is calculated, which is sensitive to changes of the in-plane spin-spin correlations. We find the magnetostriction to display a dip-like feature, in line with the temperature dependent and field-driven suppression of magnetic order in $α$-RuCl$_3$. Our results are consistent with previous findings, establishing NLCE also as a tool to study magnetoelastic features of quantum magnets.

TL;DR: Topological transitions in skyrmion crystals are studied under uniaxial anisotropy, revealing varying transition fields in easy-plane and easy-axis domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore the topological transitions in the spectrum of skyrmion crystals, specifically focusing on the effects of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy.

Method: The paper investigates the band structure of elementary excitations in a thin ferromagnetic film with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and uniaxial magnetic anisotropy under an external magnetic field.

Result: The findings show that the gap between breathing and counter-clock-wise modes closes during the topological transition, accompanied by changes in the Berry curvature sign of these bands. A phase diagram indicates that the transition field value is higher in the easy-plane domain and lower in the easy-axis domain of anisotropy.

Conclusion: The study concludes that a topological transition in the spectrum of a skyrmion crystal exists within a certain range of uniaxial anisotropy values, with the transition field varying between easy-plane and easy-axis domains of anisotropy.

Abstract: The band structure of elementary excitations of skyrmion crystal in thin ferromagnetic film with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and uniaxial magnetic anisotropy under external magnetic field is studied. In the absence of anisotropy there is a topological transition in the spectrum of skyrmion crystal: the gap between breathing and counter-clock-wise modes closes, which is accompanied by changes of Berry curvature sign of these bands. In this work we demonstrate that such topological transition exists in some range of the uniaxial anisotropy values. We present a phase diagram showing that the value of the field of topological transition is higher in the easy-plane domain and lower in the easy-axis domain of anisotropy.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explains the dZZ magnetic order in BCAO via a J1-J3 Heisenberg model, revealing an order-by-disorder mechanism and quantum fluctuation effects in the excitation spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the microscopic origin of the unexpected double-zigzag (dZZ) magnetically ordered ground state in BaCo2(AsO4)2 (BCAO) and understand its emergence in a frustrated magnetism context.

Method: Generalized Schwinger boson mean-field theory (g-SBMFT) and exact-diagonalization (ED) techniques were employed to analyze the J1-J3 Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice.

Result: The dZZ phase is selected by an order-by-disorder mechanism in a narrow J3/|J1| range, and the magnetic excitation spectra exhibit smearing due to quantum fluctuations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the double-zigzag (dZZ) magnetic order in BCAO is stabilized by an order-by-disorder mechanism within a specific J3/|J1| range, and the distinctive smearing effect in the excitation spectra due to quantum fluctuations can be observed via inelastic neutron scattering.

Abstract: The cobalt-based honeycomb magnet BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ (BCAO) has recently emerged as a promising platform for studying frustrated magnetism beyond conventional paradigms. Neutron-scattering experiments and first-principles calculations have revealed an unexpected double-zigzag (dZZ) magnetically ordered ground state, whose microscopic origin remains under active debate. Here, we investigate the emergence of such dZZ phase in a ferro-antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_3$ Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, using a generalized Schwinger boson mean-field theory ($g$-SBMFT) that treats ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions on equal footing. Based on $g$-SBMFT and exact-diagonalization (ED) techniques, we find that the dZZ is selected by an order-by-disorder mechanism in a narrow $J_3/|J_1|$ range, in agreement with recent density-matrix renormalization-group calculations. The magnetic excitation spectra within the dZZ phase displays a distinctive smearing out in momentum space due to quantum fluctuations which may be probed through inelastic neutron-scattering experiments.

TL;DR: Study shows spin-charge-entangled screening in Kondo-Majorana systems is protected by SU_L(2) symmetry, with perturbations disrupting the singlet but preserving boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how competing terms affect the spin-charge-entangled screening and boundary conditions in Kondo systems with Majorana zero modes, and to identify observable signatures of these effects.

Method: The research utilizes numerical renormalization group analysis to derive a temperature-dependent spatial integral of the screening cloud, which serves as a key observable for studying the screening process.

Result: A crossover from conventional Kondo spin screening to spin-charge-entangled screening is observed. The SU_L(2) symmetry protects the screening, while perturbations breaking it disrupt the singlet without affecting the boundary condition.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the spin-charge-entangled screening in Kondo systems with Majorana zero modes is protected by the SU_L(2) symmetry, while perturbations breaking this symmetry can disrupt the screening singlet. The evolved boundary conditions and screening cloud behavior provide insights into the system's low-energy physics.

Abstract: A side-coupled Majorana zero mode in Kondo systems realizes a simple yet nontrivial hybridization that profoundly alters the low-energy physics, making such setups promising candidates for detecting Majorana zero modes. Recently, we demonstrated that the low-energy behavior of this system can be captured by a spin-charge-entangled screening process with an \(A\otimes N\) boundary condition. Here, we investigate the evolution of both the screening cloud and the boundary condition in the presence of competing terms that could break either the spin-charge-entangled \({\rm SU}_{\bf L}(2)\) rotation symmetry or the topological degeneracy. We introduce a temperature-dependent spatial integral of the screening cloud, which can be obtained from the numerical renormalization group. This quantity serves as a proper observable that unambiguously captures the properties of the screening process across temperatures. A clear crossover from conventional Kondo spin screening to spin-charge-entangled screening is observed. Taking into account the overlap between Majorana zero modes, the \(A\otimes N\) boundary condition reduces to a normal one, yet the spin-charge-entangled screening is protected by the \({\rm SU}_{\bf L}(2)\) symmetry. On the other hand, perturbation that breaks the \({\rm SU}_{\bf L}(2)\) symmetry can destroy the screening singlet, while leaving the low-temperature \(A\otimes N\) boundary condition intact.

### [15] [$c=-2$ conformal field theory in quadratic band touching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16496)
*Rintaro Masaoka*

TL;DR: The paper connects quadratic band touching in fermionic systems to symplectic fermion theory, revealing anyonic excitations and topological degeneracy in 2+1 dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To characterize quadratic band touching in fermionic systems as a quantum critical point and explore its spatial conformal invariance and correlation functions.

Method: The author constructs explicit mappings between fermionic operators and symplectic fermion fields to establish the correspondence, emphasizing implications in two spatial dimensions where the theory is logarithmic.

Result: The paper confirms the correspondence between quadratic band touching systems and symplectic fermion theory, identifying anyonic excitations and topological degeneracy in 2+1 dimensions, with a Jordan block structure under rotation.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that a free-fermion model with quadratic band touching exhibits spatial conformal invariance, linking its correlation functions to the $d$-dimensional symplectic fermion theory. In 2+1 dimensions, it reveals anyonic excitations and topological degeneracy, showcasing a Jordan block structure under rotation.

Abstract: Quadratic band touching in fermionic systems defines a universality class distinct from that of linear Dirac points, yet its characterization as a quantum critical point remains incomplete. In this work, I show that a $(d+1)$-dimensional free-fermion model with quadratic band touching exhibits spatial conformal invariance, and that its equal-time ground-state correlation functions are exactly captured by the $d$-dimensional symplectic fermion theory. I establish this correspondence by constructing explicit mappings between physical fermionic operators and the fields of the symplectic fermion theory. I further explore the implications of this correspondence in two spatial dimensions, where the symplectic fermion theory is a logarithmic conformal field theory with central charge $c=-2$. In the corresponding $(2+1)$-dimensional systems, I identify anyonic excitations originating from the underlying symplectic fermion theory, even though the Hamiltonian is gapless. Transporting these excitations along non-contractible loops generates transitions among topologically degenerate ground states, in close analogy with those in topologically ordered phases. Moreover, the action of a $2π$ rotation on these excitations is represented by a Jordan block, reflecting the logarithmic character of the associated conformal field theory.

TL;DR: The extended Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice, analyzed via Hartree MFA, shows charge-ordered and metallic states, with onsite repulsion suppressing charge order and driving metallic behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the ground states and finite-temperature phase diagrams of the extended Hubbard model (EHM) with onsite and intersite interactions, and to simplify the analysis of phenomena using the Hartree mean-field approximation.

Method: The standard Hartree mean-field approximation (MFA) is applied to the extended Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice, enabling analytical derivations and simplifications to observe general geometry-independent features.

Result: The system exhibits charge-ordered insulating (COI), charge-order metallic (COM), or non-charge-ordered (NO) states at the ground state. Increasing onsite repulsion suppresses charge order and transitions the system from insulating to metallic behavior.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the extended Hubbard model (EHM) on the Bethe lattice, using the Hartree mean-field approximation (MFA), reveals ground states including charge-ordered insulating (COI), charge-order metallic (COM), or non-charge-ordered (NO) states. Increasing onsite repulsion suppresses charge order and shifts the system from insulating to metallic properties.

Abstract: We study the extended Hubbard model (EHM) with both onsite Hubbard interaction and the intersite density-density interaction between nearest-neighbors using the standard Hartree mean-field approximation (MFA) on the Bethe lattice. We found that, at the ground state, the system can be in a charge-ordered insulating (COI), a charge-order metallic (COM) or a non-charge-ordered (NO) state. Moreover, the finite-temperature phase diagrams are presented. Several observables like a charge-order parameter, a spectral function, and particularly at finite temperatures, a charge carrier concentration (to visualize the degree of metallicity) are analyzed. The results show that increasing onsite repulsion suppresses charge order and change the properties of the system from insulating to metallic. Worth noting, that a number of phenomena can be found within the MFA, where their analysis is much simpler than in more advanced approaches. The method used for the EHM on the Bethe lattice also allows for a series of analytical derivations and simplification to see general geometry-independent features and analytical results, avoiding the numerical inaccuracies and other issues that appear with a purely numerical solution.

*Mina Tarakemeh,Shenglong Xu*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Operator dynamics in U(1) systems are constrained by two charges, revealing a chi-squared size distribution and angular momentum-dependent complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and characterize the dynamics of operators in U(1) symmetric systems, particularly how conserved charges constrain operator growth and complexity, by leveraging a non-Abelian operator size basis and symmetry-resolved analysis.

Method: The authors construct a non-Abelian operator size basis respecting two conserved charges, derive an exact classical master equation for the size distribution, and analyze operator growth through out-of-time-ordered correlators, focusing on the charge-conserving Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.

Result: The operator size distribution follows a chi-squared form, jointly determined by two conserved charges. Operators with large angular momentum are simpler, while those with small angular momentum are more complex, with single-particle operators retaining a divergent peak at large angular momentum.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that operator dynamics in U(1) symmetric systems are constrained by two conserved charges, with operator growth characterized by angular momentum reduction. The use of a non-Abelian operator size basis and exact classical master equation reveals a chi-squared size distribution, providing insights into the interplay between conserved charges and operator complexity.

Abstract: We show that operator dynamics in U(1) symmetric systems are constrained by two independent conserved charges and construct a non-Abelian operator size basis that respects both, enabling a symmetry-resolved characterization of operator growth. The non-Abelian operator size depends on the operator's nonlocal structure and is organized by an SU(2) algebra. Operators associated with large total angular momentum are relatively simple, while those with small angular momentum are more complex. Operator growth is thus characterized by a reduction in angular momentum and can be probed using out-of-time-ordered correlators. Using the charge-conserving Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, we derive an exact classical master equation that governs the size distribution, the distribution of an operator expanded in this basis, for arbitrary system sizes. The resulting dynamics reveal that the size distribution follows a chi-squared form, with the two conserved charges jointly determining the overall time scale and the shape of the distribution. In particular, single-particle operators retain a divergent peak at large angular momentum throughout the time evolution.

### [18] [Stabilizing Fractional Chern States in Twisted MoTe2: Multi-band Correlations via Non-perturbative Renormalization Group](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16641)
*Run Hou,Andriy H. Nevidomskyy*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A new non-perturbative method (DSRG) reveals that higher bands in twisted MoTe2 significantly affect fractional quantum Hall states, reducing gaps at ν = 1/3 and stabilizing phases at ν = 2/3, aligning with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is significant interest in the fractional quantum Hall states observed in twisted MoTe2. Traditional theoretical methods, like exact diagonalization, are limited to one band, and the impact of higher bands is largely unexplored. This study aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors introduce a non-perturbative driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG) method, originally from quantum chemistry, to analyze the effects of higher lying bands in twisted MoTe2. The methodology is applied at fractional hole fillings of ν = 1/3 and 2/3 across various twist angles.

Result: At ν = 1/3, the excitation energy gaps are significantly reduced compared to single-band models. For ν = 2/3, dynamic correlations stabilize fractional Chern insulating phases at larger twist angles, as observed experimentally.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that dynamic correlations from interband interactions stabilize fractional Chern insulating phases at larger twist angles, aligning with experimental findings. The results highlight the importance of considering higher lying bands in theoretical models.

Abstract: The observation of fraction quantum Hall states in twisted MoTe2 has sparked a lof of interest in this phenomenon. Most theoretical works to date rely on the brute-force exact diagonalization which is limited to the one partially occupied band. In this work, we present strong evidence that the effect of higher lying bands cannot be ignored due to strong interband interactions. To tackle these effects, we introduce a non-perturbative driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG) method, originally developed for problems in quantum chemistry. We apply this methodology to twisted MoTe2 at fractional hole fillings of ν = 1/3 and 2/3 across a spectrum of twist angles. Our results show that at ν = 1/3, the many-body excitation energy gaps are substantially reduced compared to the one-band treatment. For ν = 2/3, we find that the dynamic correlations stemming from interband interactions stabilize fractional Chern insulating phases at larger twist angles, consistent with the experimental findings. By examining the correlated orbitals and their single-particle topological features, we demonstrate that this stabilization at higher twist angles arises predominantly from the dynamic correlations, rather than conditions on the single-particle quantum geometric tensor.

*Christopher A. Leong,Bitan Roy*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Hyperbolic lattices with modulated hopping patterns simulate axial magnetic fields, inducing flat bands and ordered phases; non-Hermiticity amplifies these effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effects of axial magnetic fields on Dirac fermions in hyperbolic lattices and unify the phenomenon of axial magnetic catalysis across different geometries, including Euclidean planes.

Method: The study employs a nearest-neighbor tight-binding model on hyperbolic lattices ({10,3} and {14,3}) with spatially modulated hopping patterns to simulate axial magnetic fields and analyze resulting electronic phases.

Result: The modulated hopping patterns produce flat bands and trigger charge density-waves, Haldane phases, and magnetic orders. Non-Hermiticity enhances these effects when eigenvalues remain real.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that spatially modulated hopping patterns in hyperbolic lattices can induce axial magnetic fields, leading to flat bands and various ordered phases. Non-Hermiticity further amplifies these effects under certain conditions.

Abstract: Starting from the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model on {10,3} and {14,3} hyperbolic lattices that, for a uniform hopping amplitude, gives rise to emergent Dirac fermions on a curved space with a constant negative curvature, displaying a vanishing density of states, we propose spatially modulated hopping pattern therein that preserve the underlying 5- and 7-fold rotational symmetries, respectively, and effectively couples fermions to time-reversal symmetric axial magnetic fields. Such strain-induced axial fields produce a flat band near zero-energy, triggering nucleation of a charge density-wave, featuring a staggered pattern of fermionic density between two sublattices, and the Haldane phase fostering intra-sublattice circulating currents with a net zero magnetic flux for weak nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. Sufficiently weak on-site Hubbard repulsion destabilizes such flat bands toward the formation of a magnetic phase that simultaneously supports antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic orders in the whole system. While the magnetization in the bulk and boundary cancel each other, the Neél order is of the same sign everywhere, thereby yielding a global antiferromagnet. Throughout, we draw parallels between these findings and the well-studied qualitatively similar results on a 3-fold rotational symmetric strained honeycomb lattice, thereby unifying the phenomenon of axial magnetic catalysis for Dirac fermions, encompassing the ones living on the Euclidean plane. Finally, we show that with a specific class of non-Hermiticity, manifesting via an imbalance in the hopping amplitudes between two sublattices in the opposite directions, magnitudes of all these orders can be boosted substantially when all the eigenvalues in the noninteracting systems are real, staging a non-Hermitian amplification of axial magnetic catalysis.

*Raditya Weda Bomantara*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper explores non-Hermitian Floquet topological phenomena in bosonic Kitaev chains, highlighting robust topological edge modes and varying responses of the non-Hermitian skin effect to perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore rich non-Hermitian Floquet topological phenomena in periodically driven bosonic Kitaev chains and understand their responses to perturbations.

Method: Two specific models are analyzed in detail: a minimal topologically nontrivial model and a more sophisticated model with tunable topological modes. The models are subjected to perturbations like onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder.

Result: Topological edge modes are generally robust against perturbations, while the non-Hermitian skin effect shows varying responses—suppressed or revived by perturbations in the first model but potentially insensitive in the second model.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of periodically driven bosonic Kitaev chains as a platform to explore diverse non-Hermitian Floquet topological phases through Hermitian systems.

Abstract: We propose a class of periodically driven (Hermitian) modified bosonic Kitaev chains that effectively hosts rich nonHermitian Floquet topological phenomena. Two particular models are investigated in details as case studies. The first of these represents a minimal topologically nontrivial model in which nonHermitian skin effect, topological zero modes, and topological $π$ modes coexist. The other displays a more sophisticated model that supports multiple topological zero modes and topological $π$ modes in a tunable manner. By subjecting both models to perturbations such as a finite onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder, these features exhibit distinct responses. In particular, while generally all topological edge modes are robust against such perturbations, the nonHermitian skin effect is easily suppressed and revived by, respectively, the onsite bosonic frequency and spatial disorder in the first model, but it could be insensitive to both perturbations in the second model. Our studies thus demonstrate the prospect of a periodically driven bosonic Kitaev chain as a starting point in exploring various nonHermitian Floquet topological phases through the lens of a Hermitian system.

TL;DR: VHS in electronic bands influence exciton and trion properties; engineering these can open new applications in quantum materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of VHS on exciton and trion formation and properties in electronic band structures, and explore potential applications in engineered quantum materials.

Method: Analysis of Mexican-hat-type dispersion and higher-order VHS (HOVHS) in the valence band to study their effects on exciton and trion formation and properties.

Result: Narrower Mexican-hat dispersion favors trion formation; HOVHS in the valence band modifies bound-state DOS, creating new states that affect optical properties.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates how engineering 2D quantum materials with specific van-Hove singularities (VHS) can control the formation and properties of excitons and trions, offering potential applications in optical materials.

Abstract: We investigate the role of van-Hove singularities (VHS) in a system's electronic band structure on the formation and properties of excitons and trions. We consider (i) the different parameters of a Mexican-hat-type dispersion of the valence band, which hosts a VHS at the band edge, and (ii) the presence of regular VHS or higher-order VHS (HOVHS). We find that for a given spin-degenerate Mexican-hat-shaped valence band, where a trion and exciton can form, trion formation becomes more favourable as the Mexican-hat dispersion becomes narrower. Also, we show that if the electronic band structure contains an HOVHS, then both the exciton and trion dispersion will also contain such a singularity. Therefore, a HOVHS in the valence band can suitably change the density of states (DOS) of the bound-state particle and lead to the generation of new states, which could impact the optical properties of the system. Our work provides a pathway to how 2D quantum materials, which host such singularities, can be engineered to favour a particular bound-state thus opening new avenues for these materials into potential applications.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The study finds no strong evidence for non-chiral edge states in dissipative transport in magnetically doped topological insulators, suggesting they may not be a significant factor in limiting high-temperature quantized anomalous Hall effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aimed to investigate the source of dissipative transport in magnetically doped topological insulators, focusing on the potential role of non-chiral edge states, which are expected in thicker samples.

Method: Extensive Hall and non-local resistance measurements were performed in a Hall bar geometry at 2 K. The behavior was compared to different transport models, including a simple continuum Ohm's law model.

Result: The system behavior aligns with a simple continuum Ohm's law model, and the inclusion of non-chiral edge states does not significantly improve the fitting. Thus, no strong evidence for these states was found.

Conclusion: The study concludes that non-chiral edge states are not significantly contributing to dissipative transport in the system. The results suggest limited evidence for these states, which has implications for achieving high-temperature quantized anomalous Hall effect in these materials.

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect shows great promise for realization of the ohm without the need for an external magnetic field. The most mature material platform is magnetically doped topological insulators. In these materials, precise quantization is limited to low temperatures, with the activation energy for dissipative transport typically in the range of 1 K. One potential source of dissipative transport is non-chiral edge states. These states are expected to be present in sufficiently thick samples. In this work, we perform extensive Hall and non-local resistance measurements in a Hall bar geometry at 2 K. By comparing 15 independent transport measurements to different transport models, we find that the system behavior is well-described by a simple continuum Ohm's law model. The addition of non-chiral edge states into the model does not significantly improve the fitting, and we conclude that there is not strong evidence for these states. We discuss the implications of our results for the prospect of high temperature quantized anomalous Hall effect in these materials.

Abstract: Here, we investigate the spin waves in room-temperature van der Waals ferromagnet $(\rm Fe_{0.78}Co_{0.22})_{5}GeTe_{2}$ by utilizing Brillouin light scattering technique. The spin wave dispersion in flakes of different thicknesses shows the key role of dipolar interaction in the spin waves of vdW ferromagnets, and the non-reciprocity of spin wave in thick flakes is observed, which is attributed to the bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction after excluding the influence of dynamic dipolar interaction. The measured bulk DMI parameter D is 0.08 $\rm mJ/m^2$, which is double that of pure $\rm Fe_5GeTe_2$. Our work shows that Co-doped $\rm Fe_5GeTe_2$ is a promising platform for investigating propagating spin wave and topological spin textures at room temperature.

Conclusion: The improved Simmons model provides more accurate analytical formulas for tunneling current density and conductance, demonstrating significant differences from the original Simmons model when applied to experimental data.

Abstract: The Simmons model is a well-known and widely used model for the elastic tunneling current of a metallic tunnel junction, and fitting it to electrical measurements can be used to estimate thicknesses and heights of the tunnel barriers. We present here an improvement of the Simmons model, deriving new more accurate analytical formulas for the tunneling current density and conductance at finite voltage and temperature. We demonstrate that our conductance-voltage formulas are much closer to the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation than the Simmons model and its commonly used simplified parabolic approximation. In addition, we demonstrate the practical use of our model, by fitting it to experimental tunnel junction conductance-voltage data and showing a sizeable difference from the Simmons model.

Motivation: To explore the potential of skyrmionium meta-matter composed of skyrmioniums and skyrmions in periodic lattices, aiming to stabilize and control diverse mixed crystals and their dynamics.

Method: Investigates skyrmionium meta-matter by classifying states by topological stoichiometry, analyzing structural transformations, and exploring collective spin dynamics under AC magnetic fields.

Result: Identifies hybrid excitations unique to Skm--Sk crystals, including deformation-assisted rotations and orbital modes, with frequencies spanning sub-GHz to above 10 GHz, consistent with exchange and DMI energy scales.

Conclusion: The study establishes skyrmionium-based meta-matter as a versatile platform for tunable magnetic lattices with rich structural and dynamic properties, offering potential for reconfigurable magnonic and spintronic applications.

Abstract: We introduce and systematically investigate a new class of topological magnetic textures, skyrmionium meta-matter, composed of skyrmioniums (Skm, $Q=0$) and skyrmions (Sk, $Q=-1$) arranged in periodic lattices mimicking the richness of atomic materials. Pure skyrmionium lattices are unstable against elongation distortions and relax into the spiral phase, but even a small fraction of skyrmions acts as topological "pins" that stabilize diverse mixed Skm--Sk crystals. We classify these states by topological stoichiometry (Skm$_n$Sk$_m$) and show that each composition hosts multiple metastable polymorphs with distinct plane-group symmetries. Structural transformations between polymorphs are achieved by varying the lattice spacing, suggesting experimental control via pressure or strain. The collective spin dynamics is explored for both in-plane and out-of-plane AC magnetic fields. The resulting absorption spectra show resonant modes beyond the two rotational and one breathing mode of conventional skyrmion lattices. We identify hybrid excitations unique to Skm--Sk crystals, including (i) deformation-assisted rotations, where skyrmions acquire polygonal shapes and rotate, and (ii) orbital modes, where breathing skyrmioniums induce circular motion of confined skyrmions without changing their size. Mode frequencies span sub-GHz to above 10 GHz, consistent with exchange and DMI energy scales. Our results establish skyrmionium-based meta-matter as a versatile platform for tunable, topologically heterogeneous magnetic lattices with rich structural and dynamical properties, paving the way for reconfigurable magnonic and spintronic applications.

Motivation: To explore unconventional superconductivity mechanisms that resist magnetic field suppression, particularly in graphene platforms with spin-triplet pairing or strong spin-orbit coupling.

Method: The research investigates superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene under in-plane magnetic fields, analyzing critical fields, gate sensitivity, and the emergence of a superconducting diode effect.

Result: Superconductivity is induced and stabilized by in-plane magnetic fields, far exceeding the Pauli limit, with a wide gate range and gate-sensitive critical temperature. A weak superconducting diode effect is observed near an integer quantum anomalous Hall state.

Conclusion: The study establishes intriguing properties of spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene, including resilience to magnetic fields beyond the Pauli limit and a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity.

Abstract: Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity once the Zeeman energy exceeds the pairing gap, unless mechanisms such as unconventional pairing, strong spin-orbit coupling, or intrinsic magnetism intervene. Several graphene platforms realize such mitigating routes, exhibiting superconductivity resilient to magnetic fields. Here we report superconductivity in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene that is both induced and stabilized by in-plane magnetic field ($B_{\parallel}$), with critical fields far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit. The superconductivity spans a wide gate range and emerges from a sharp zero-field resistive ridge that tracks approximately constant conduction band filling. The presence of zero-field superconductivity and the evolution of the critical temperature with $B_{\parallel}$ are highly gate sensitive. We also observe a weak superconducting diode effect in several distinct regimes within the superconducting phase, including nearby to an integer quantum anomalous Hall state generated by a boron nitride moiré superlattice, indicating a potential coexistence of valley imbalance and superconductivity. These results establish several intriguing new properties of spin-triplet, field-induced superconductivity in a thick rhombohedral graphene stack.

Result: The geometry produces a bound state with energy 0.659606 in units of the minimum continuum state energy. The variational solution achieves a lower energy of 0.6812 in the same units.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that a simple quantum dot geometry of two crossed troughs can yield a bound state, and presents an accurate numerical method to solve it, along with a variational solution achieving the lowest known energy analytically.

Abstract: We describe a simple quantum dot that consists of two crossed troughs. As such there is no potential well; nonetheless this geometry gives rise to a bound state, centred around the point at which these troughs cross one another. In this paper we review existing numerical methods to solve this problem, and highlight one which we feel is particularly elegant and, in this case, provides the most accurate solution to the problem. The bound state is well-contained on the scale of the trough width, and yields a bound state energy of $0.659606$ in units of the minimum continuum state energy. This method also motivates a simple variational solution which yields the lowest energy known to date ($0.6812$ in the same units) to arise out of an analytical variational solution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the magnetic phase diagram of van der Waals antiferromagnetic monolayers, a challenging task due to the lack of sensitivity in established techniques.

Method: Magnetotransport measurements in field-effect transistor devices were used to analyze temperature-dependent conductance and magnetoresistance data.

Result: Monolayer NiPS3 exhibits two magnetic transitions with a low-temperature phase governed by in-plane hexagonal magnetic anisotropy, differing from the single transition in thicker samples.

Conclusion: The study highlights the unique magnetic behavior of monolayer NiPS3 compared to thicker samples, experimentally validating theoretical models like the six-state clock and 2D-XY models.

Abstract: Two-dimensional antiferromagnetism has long attracted significant interest in many areas of condensed matter physics, but only recently has experimental exploration become feasible due to the isolation of van der Waals antiferromagnetic monolayers. Probing the magnetic phase diagram of these monolayers remains however challenging because established experimental techniques often lack the required sensitivity. Here, we investigate antiferromagnetism in atomically thin van der Waals magnet NiPS3 using magnetotransport measurements in field-effect transistor devices. Temperature-dependent conductance and magnetoresistance data reveal a distinct magnetic behavior in monolayers as compared to thicker samples. While bilayer and multilayer NiPS3 exhibit a single magnetic phase transition into a zig-zag antiferromagnetic state driven by uniaxial anisotropy, monolayer NiPS3 undergoes two magnetic transitions, with a low-temperature phase governed by in-plane hexagonal magnetic anisotropy. The experimentally constructed phase diagram for monolayer NiPS3 matches theoretical predictions from the six-state clock and 2D-XY models incorporating hexagonal anisotropy.

Conclusion: The study uncovers the quantum-geometric origin of phonon dichroisms and predicts detectable signatures of the heat magnetic moment in solids, demonstrated in a ferromagnetic two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

Abstract: The quantum geometry tensor, intrinsic geometric characteristics of electronic states, plays a crucial role in the various nontrivial electromagnetic phenomena in quantum materials. Here, we reveal that quantum geometry significantly modifies phonon dichroisms through electron-phonon interactions in solids that break time-reversal and spatial inversion symmetries. Specifically, the circular phonon dichroism is primarily dominated by the heat magnetic moments, while the linear phonon dichroism depends on the heat Drude weight, a thermal analog of band Drude weight. Furthermore, we establish the f-sum rule for the heat magnetic moment that facilitates its experimental detections. We demonstrate our key findings in an archetypal model system: ferromagnetic two-dimensional electron gases with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our work uncovers the quantum-geometric origin of common phonon dichroisms and predicts the detectable signature of the heat magnetic moment of electrons in solids.

Motivation: To explore and characterize spatiotemporal vortices carrying nontrivial topological spin textures and their potential applications in quantum optics.

Method: STPVs are generated by chronotopic interference of temporally delayed plasmonic eigen-vortices, with their dynamics imaged using interferometric time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (ITR-PEEM).

Result: Direct imaging of nanometer-attosecond evolution of STPVs, control of vortex number and position, and analysis of nonlinear plasmonic polarization fields and angular-momentum conservation through quantum-path analysis.

Conclusion: The introduction and characterization of spatiotemporal plasmonic vortices (STPVs) provide a new platform for probing spatiotemporally structured quantum matter, with potential applications in quantum optics and nanotechnology.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal vortices are polychromatic modes that intertwine orbital angular momentum (OAM) in space and time. Here we introduce a new class of such vortices, spatiotemporal plasmonic vortices (STPVs), carrying nontrivial topological spin textures. They are generated by chronotopic interference of temporally delayed plasmonic eigen-vortices, where a $π$-phase dislocation in the space-frequency domain maps into a 2$π$ spiraling phase in space-time, with the resulting focus-defocus dynamics emulate U(1) gauge transitions. Using interferometric time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy (ITR-PEEM), we directly image their nanometer-attosecond (nano-atto) evolution and control vortex number and position. Quantum-path analysis of coherent two-photon photoemission (2PP) processes reveals the nonlinear plasmonic polarization fields and angular-momentum conservation, establishing STPVs as a platform for probing spatiotemporally structured quantum matter.

TL;DR: Ultrafast bandgap engineering in α-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ achieved via spectroscopy and theory, enabling precise control for quantum and optoelectronic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of conventional methods for band structure control (chemical doping, lattice strain, external gating), which are quasi-static and lack the required femto- to picosecond dynamics.

Method: The study employs cryogenic transient reflectance spectroscopy, first-principles calculations, and tight-binding theory to achieve dynamic bandgap engineering in α-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ with micro-electron-volt precision.

Result: Dynamic bandgap engineering is achieved with unprecedented precision using topological carriers and symmetry-resolved coherent phonons, enabling gradual and oscillatory control of electronic structure. A dual-pump coherent control strategy is demonstrated for continuous, mode-selective tuning.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates a novel framework for ultrafast and precise band-structure engineering in topological insulators, paving the way for advancements in quantum optoelectronics, precision measurement, and attosecond control of matter.

Abstract: Precise and ultrafast control of electronic band structures is a central challenge for advancing quantum functional materials and devices. Conventional approaches--such as chemical doping, lattice strain, or external gating--offer robust stability but remain confined to the quasi-static regime, far from the intrinsic femto- to picosecond dynamics that govern many-body interactions. Here, using cryogenic transient reflectance spectroscopy, we realize dynamic bandgap engineering in the anisotropic topological insulator $α$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ with unprecedented micro-electron-volt ($μ$eV) precision. The exceptional sensitivity arises from the cooperative action of long-lived topological carriers, stabilized by restricted bulk-to-edge scattering phase space, together with symmetry-resolved coherent phonons that modulate inter-chain hopping. These channels jointly modify Coulomb screening and interband transitions, enabling both gradual and oscillatory control of the electronic structure. Supported by first-principles and tight-binding theory, we further demonstrate a dual-pump coherent control strategy for continuous, mode-selective tuning of electronic energies with $μ$eV accuracy. This framework paves the way for ultrafast on-demand band-structure engineering, pointing toward new frontiers in quantum optoelectronics, precision measurement in molecular and biological systems, and attosecond control of matter.

Abstract: The experimental observations of many interaction-driven electronic phases in moiré superlattices have stimulated intense theoretical and experimental efforts to understand and engineer these correlated physics. Strain is a powerful tool for manipulating and controlling the geometrical and electronic structures of moiré superlattices. This review provides a comprehensive introduction to the geometry of strained moiré superlattices. First, starting from the linear elasticity theory, we briefly introduce the general formalism of small deformations in two-dimensional materials, and discuss the particular cases of uniaxial, shear and biaxial strain. Then, we apply the theory to twisted and strained moiré materials, mainly focusing on the hexagonal homobilayers, hexagonal heterobilayers and monoclinic lattices. Special moiré geometries, like the quasi-unidimensional patterns, square patterns and hexagonal, are theoretically predicted by manipulating the strain and twist. Finally, we review recently developed strain techniques and the special moiré geometries realized via these approaches. This review aims at equipping the reader with a robust understanding on the description and implementation of strain in moiré materials, as well as highlight some major breakthroughs in this active field.

TL;DR: Hyperbolic lattices break the Goldstone theorem for vector fields, causing gapped bulk phonons and extensive boundary modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how negative curvature in hyperbolic lattices reshapes collective excitations beyond Euclidean intuition, particularly for vector fields.

Method: Studied vector fields on hyperbolic lattices using phonons as an example, analyzing the behavior of Goldstone modes and their representations.

Result: Acoustic phonon modes are gapped in hyperbolic lattices with z > 2d due to nonunitary representations of the translation group, and boundaries introduce extensive low-frequency modes.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic lattices exhibit unique properties for vector fields, such as a breakdown of the Goldstone theorem, leading to a finite bulk phonon gap and extensive boundary modes when z > 2d.

Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices extend crystallinity into curved space, where negative curvature and exponentially large boundaries reshape collective excitations beyond Euclidean intuition. In this Letter, we push the study beyond scalar fields by exploring vector fields on hyperbolic lattices. Using phonons as an example, we show that the Goldstone theorem breaks down for vector fields in hyperbolic lattices. In stark contrast to Euclidean crystals, where the Goldstone theorem ensures that acoustic phonon modes are gapless, hyperbolic lattices with coordination number $z > 2d$ exhibit a finite bulk phonon gap. We identify the origin of this breakdown: the Goldstone modes here belong to nonunitary representations of the translation group and therefore cannot form gapless excitation branches. We further show that when boundaries are included, this bulk spetrum gap is filled by an extensive number of low-frequency boundary modes.

TL;DR: The paper resolves ambiguities in the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect theory by showing the response depends on the dissipation mechanism, revealing geometric and kinetic contributions to the conductivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address conflicting expressions for the conductivity in the theory of the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect and to clarify the origin of this ambiguity.

Method: The authors solve the exact non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) density matrix for a generic Bloch system coupled to a featureless fermionic bath.

Result: The exact conductivity decomposes into a geometric contribution (recovering the intraband quantum metric dipole) and a novel kinetic contribution, which is absent in white-noise disorder models. This discrepancy proves the nonlinear conductivity is not unique to the Bloch Hamiltonian but depends on the system-bath coupling.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the ambiguity in the theory of the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect by demonstrating that the 'intrinsic' response is not universal but depends on the dissipation mechanism. The exact conductivity decomposes into geometric and kinetic contributions, with the latter proving that the nonlinear conductivity is contingent on the system-bath coupling.

Abstract: The theory of the intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect, a key probe of quantum geometry, is plagued by conflicting expressions for the conductivity that is independent of the dissipation strength (rate, $Γ^0$). We clarify the origin of this ambiguity by demonstrating that the "intrinsic" response is not universal, but is inextricably linked to the dissipation mechanism that establishes the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). We establish a benchmark by solving the exact NESS density matrix for a generic Bloch system coupled to a featureless fermionic bath. Our exact $Γ^0$ conductivity decomposes into two parts: (i) a geometric contribution, $σ^{\text{geo}}$, whose form recovers the intraband quantum metric dipole ($\sim\partial_k g$), providing an exact derivation that clarifies inconsistencies in the literature, and (ii) a novel, purely kinetic contribution, $σ^{\text{kin}} \propto v^3 f^{(4)}_0$, which is absent when dissipation is modeled by white-noise disorder (e.g., a constant-$Γ$ Green's function model). The discrepancy in $σ^{\text{kin}}$ between these distinct physical mechanisms is a proof that the $Γ^0$ nonlinear conductivity is not a unique property of the Bloch Hamiltonian, but is contingent on the physical system-bath coupling.

Motivation: The existence of magnetostatic surface spin wave (MSSW) solitons has long been debated, and their study holds great promise for magnonic information processing.

Method: Advanced time-resolved Brillouin light scattering (TR-BLS) spectroscopy was used to observe long-period MSSW soliton trains in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films. The study demonstrated quasiparticle behavior, mode beating, and periodic modulations.

Result: The study revealed that MSSW solitons originate from the dipole gap mechanism with a unique comb-like frequency spectrum caused by the four-magnon process. Variations in microwave power showed significant changes in soliton periods linked to spin wave dispersion renormalization. Exotic transverse solitons across the YIG thickness were also reported.

Conclusion: These findings deepen the understanding of nonlinear physics and pave the way for spin-wave-soliton-based information technologies.

Motivation: To explore non-reciprocal intracell hopping mediated non-Hermitian topological phases in an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with second-nearest-neighbour hopping.

Method: The paper analyzes phase boundaries using non-Bloch momentum and examines adiabatic dynamics to justify the bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) in spatio-temporal Bott index and non-Bloch Chern number.

Result: The non-Bloch momentum accurately reflects the BBC, explaining the winding number profile under open boundary conditions. Quantized flow of charge transport is preserved or broken based on gap-closing events in non-Bloch bands.

Conclusion: This study systematically unifies the concept of non-Bloch bands for both static and driven situations.

Abstract: We explore the non-reciprocal intracell hopping mediated non-Hermitian topological phases of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model hosting second-nearest-neighbour hopping. We microscopically analyze the phase boundaries using the non-Bloch momentum while the off-critical (critical) phases are directly associated with the gapped (gapless) nature of the non-Bloch bands that we derive from the characteristic equation using the gauge freedom. The non-Bloch momentum accurately reflects the bulk boundary correspondence (BBC) explaining the winding number profile under open boundary conditions. We examine the adiabatic dynamics to promote the concept of adiabatic charge transport in a non-Hermitian scenario justifying the BBC in spatio-temporal Bott index and non-Bloch Chern number. Once the non-Bloch bands experience no (a) gap-closing during the evolution of time, quantized flow of is preserved (broken). Our study systematically unifies the concept of non-Bloch bands for both static and driven situations.

Motivation: To investigate the correlation between the spatial profile of the moiré superlattice and the optically active states accessible to interlayer excitons in MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayers with a twist angle.

Method: Combining lateral force microscopy and micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy to study the spatial profile of the moiré superlattice and the distribution of optically active states.

Result: A continuous moiré lattice is realized in regions close to the optical diffraction limit, with photoluminescence reduced to a few narrow-band lines consistent with the moiré lattice geometry.

Conclusion: Interlayer excitons in MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayers exhibit a controlled periodic confinement, which potentially enables implementations of Bose-Hubbard models.

Abstract: We study interlayer excitons in MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayers, by combining lateral force microscopy and micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy. This allows us to correlate the spatial profile of the moiré superlattice with the distribution of optically active states accessible to interlayer excitons. In heterostructures where a few degrees twist angle is imposed between the MoSe and WSe crystallographic axes, we show that a continuous moiré lattice is realized across areas close to the optical diffraction limit. In such regions, the photoluminescence reduces to a few narrow-band lines only, energetically distributed consistently with the geometry of the moiré lattice. This correlation reveals that interlayer excitons explore a controlled periodic confinement, paving the way towards implementations of Bose-Hubbard models.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the potential of the GASP framework for efficiently encoding stock price data into quantum states, enhancing fidelity and paving the way for more precise financial analysis on NISQ-era quantum computers.

Abstract: Quantum computing holds immense potential for transforming financial analysis and decision-making. Realising this potential necessitates the efficient encoding and processing of financial data on quantum computers. In this study, we propose using the GASP (Genetic Algorithm for State Preparation) framework to optimise the encoding of stock price data into quantum states and show it can enhance both the fidelity and efficiency of the encoding process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by encoding stock price data onto both a simulated and real quantum computer to calculate the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) entropy. Our results show improvements in fidelity and the potential for more precise financial analysis. This research provides insights into the applicability of GASP for the efficient encoding of real-world data, specifically stock price data, which is crucial for quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era quantum computers.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Monte-Carlo optimization method to create multi-mode squeezed states in bosonic systems, achieving an intermediate QFI scaling between SQL and HL, applicable to quantum gravimetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend quantum-enhanced sensing beyond two-mode bosonic systems by developing a method to prepare multi-mode squeezed states, which have been non-trivial to achieve. This is particularly relevant for applications in gravimetry and gradiometry.

Method: The research employs a Monte-Carlo based optimization technique to engineer Hamiltonian control-sequences for multi-mode bosonic systems. Specifically, it considers a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice and analyzes the distribution of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) over the Hilbert space.

Result: The results show an intermediate scaling of the QFI: O(N²L + L²N), which lies between the standard quantum limit (SQL) and the Heisenberg limit (HL). A finite subset of the Hilbert space exhibits this scaling, and the study confirms that such states can be produced using realistic experimental parameters.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that metrologically useful multi-mode squeezed states can be generated using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, with an intermediate scaling of the quantum Fisher information between the standard quantum limit and the Heisenberg limit. This indicates that the Heisenberg limit can be approached in quantum gravimetry under realistic experimental conditions.

Abstract: Bosonic systems, such as photons and ultracold atoms, have played a central role in demonstrating quantum-enhanced sensing. Quantum entanglement, through squeezed and GHZ states, enables sensing beyond classical limits. However, such a quantum advantage has so far been confined to two-mode bosonic systems, as analogous multi-mode squeezed states are non-trivial to prepare. Here, we develop a Monte-Carlo based optimization technique which can be used to efficiently engineer a Hamiltonian control-sequence for multi-mode bosonic systems to prepare multi-mode squeezed states. Specifically, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, relevant for applications in gravimetry and gradiometry, and demonstrate that metrologically useful squeezed states can be generated using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian which includes on-site atomic interactions, tunable via Feshbach resonances. By analyzing the distribution (density) of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) over the Hilbert space, we identify a characteristic \textit{intermediate scaling} of the QFI: $\mathcal{O}(N^2 L+L^2 N)$, which lies between the standard quantum limit (SQL) and the Heisenberg limit (HL) for $N$ atoms in $L$ modes. We show that in general, within the Hilbert space there is a finite, $\mathcal{O}(1)$ measure subset of Hilbert space with an intermediate QFI scaling. Therefore, one can find a Hamiltonian control sequence using a Monte Carlo optimization over random control sequences, that produces a state with intermediate scaling of the QFI. We assume an experimentally accessible range of the control parameters in the Hamiltonian resources and show that the intermediate scaling can be readily achieved. Our results indicate that the HL can be approached in quantum gravimetry using realistic experimental parameters for systems with $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $N\gg L$.

*Angelos Pelecanos,Jack Spilecki,Ewin Tang,John Wright*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simple, sample-optimal mixed state tomography method by leveraging pure state algorithms and purification, challenging the notion that mixed state estimation is fundamentally harder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the belief that estimating mixed states is inherently harder than estimating pure states, and to simplify mixed state tomography using existing pure state algorithms.

Method: The method involves converting copies of an unknown mixed state into a purification, running pure state tomography on the purification, and then estimating the original mixed state. The purification step is facilitated by the 'acorn trick'.

Result: A sample-optimal and gate-efficient tomography algorithm for mixed states is developed, achieving ε-closeness in fidelity with minimal samples and polynomial gates. The results are applicable to various tomography scenarios, including limited entanglement and quantum metrology.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in conceptual difficulty between mixed and pure state tomography, simplifying the process by leveraging pure state algorithms and purification techniques.

Abstract: A longstanding belief in quantum tomography is that estimating a mixed state is far harder than estimating a pure state. This is borne out in the mathematics, where mixed state algorithms have always required more sophisticated techniques to design and analyze than pure state algorithms. We present a new approach to tomography demonstrating that, contrary to this belief, state-of-the-art mixed state tomography follows easily and naturally from pure state algorithms.
  We analyze the following strategy: given $n$ copies of an unknown state $ρ$, convert them into copies of a purification $|ρ\rangle$; run a pure state tomography algorithm to produce an estimate of $|ρ\rangle$; and output the resulting estimate of $ρ$. The purification subroutine was recently discovered via the "acorn trick" of Tang, Wright, and Zhandry. With this strategy, we obtain the first tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal in all parameters. For a rank-$r$ $d$-dimensional state, it uses $n = O((rd + \log(1/δ))/\varepsilon)$ samples to output an estimate which is $\varepsilon$-close in fidelity with probability at least $1-δ$. This algorithm also uses poly$(n)$ gates, making it the first gate-efficient tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal even in terms of the dimension $d$ alone. Moreover, with this method we recover essentially all results on mixed state tomography, including its applications to tomography with limited entanglement, classical shadows, and quantum metrology. Our proofs are simple, closing the gap in conceptual difficulty between mixed and pure tomography. Our results also clarify the role of entangled measurement in mixed state tomography: the only step of the algorithm which requires entanglement across copies is the purification step, suggesting that, for tomography, the reason entanglement is useful is for consistent purification.

TL;DR: A scheme to test quantum nonclassicality in large qubit-ensembles via MR violation, showing practical limits to Bohr's correspondence principle and feasibility with current technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test the nonclassicality of a macroscopic ensemble of qubits and explore the macroscopic limits of quantum mechanics by violating the classical notion of macrorealism (MR).

Method: An experimental scheme using an electromagnetic resonator to probe the parity of a qubit-ensemble, enabling sequential measurements to manifest the nonclassicality of the ensemble, even as its size grows.

Result: A constant violation of MR is found in the noiseless case, regardless of ensemble size. Environmental decoherence and inhomogeneity lead to the quantum-to-classical transition.

Conclusion: Bohr's correspondence principle is not fundamental but a consequence of practical limitations, as environmental decoherence and inhomogeneity precipitate the quantum-to-classical transition. Violation of macrorealism (MR) is detectable up to 100 qubits with current technology.

Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme to test the nonclassicality of a macroscopic ensemble of qubits, through the violation of the classical notion of macrorealism (MR) via the fundamental measurement-induced disturbance of quantum systems. An electromagnetic resonator is used to probe the parity of the qubit-ensemble. The action of sequential measurements allows the nonclassicality of whole ensemble to manifest itself, in the ideal case, irrespective of its size. This enables to probe the macroscopic limits of quantum mechanics as the qubit-ensemble is, effectively, a single large spin of many $\hbar$ units. Even as $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ in comparison to the total angular momentum of the ensemble, a constant amount of violation of MR is found in the noiseless case. However, environmental decoherence and inhomogeneity of qubit-electromagnetic field couplings precipitate the quantum-to-classical transition. This implies that Bohr's correspondence principle is not fundamental, but a consequence of practical limitations. We outline an implementation with a variety of qubits (superconducting qubits, spins in semiconductors, and Rydberg atoms) coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator, and - via the corresponding noise analysis - find that violation of MR is detectable up to $100$ qubits via current technology.

Conclusion: 通过违反宏观现实主义（MR）的非干扰条件（NDC），为量子计算机的量子性质提供了可扩展的基准测试方法，并在实际量子计算机上验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: To perform meaningful computations, Quantum Computers (QCs) must scale to macroscopic levels - i.e., to a large number of qubits - an objective pursued by most quantum companies. How to efficiently test their quantumness at these scales? We show that the violation of Macrorealism (MR), being the fact that classical systems possess definite properties that can be measured without disturbances, provide a fruitful avenue to this aim. The No Disturbance Condition (NDC) - the equality used here to test MR - can be violated by two consecutive parity measurements on $N$ qubits and found to be independent of $N$ under ideal conditions. However, realistic noisy QCs show a quantum-to-classical transition as $N$ increases, giving a foundationally-motivated scalable benchmarking metric. Two methods are formulated to implement this metric: one that involves a mid-circuit measurement, probing the irreversible collapse of the wavefunction, in contrast to the reversible entanglement generated in the other. Both methods are designed to be clumsiness-loophole free: the unwanted classical disturbances are negligible within statistical error. Violation of MR is detected on a IBM QC up to $N = 38$ qubits, increasing $N$ by one order of magnitude over best known results of MR. Two QCs are benchmarked using the proposed NDC metric, showing a three-fold improvement in their quantumness from one generation to the next.

TL;DR: Cyclone enhances QCCD performance with a ring topology, improving speed and reducing errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current grid-based QCCD architectures limit the performance of highly parallelizable codes due to serialization from roadblocks, increasing latency and error accumulation.

Method: Proposes Cyclone, a flexible ring topology for QCCDs, eliminating roadblocks and enabling high parallelism in shuttling operations.

Result: Cyclone achieves up to a 4x speedup, 2x-3x improvement in logical error rates for HGP and BB codes, and reduces required traps and ancilla qubits by 2x.

Conclusion: Cyclone's circular software-hardware codesign significantly improves execution speed and reduces logical error rates, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional 2D QCCD architectures.

Abstract: Modular trapped-ion quantum computing hardware, known as QCCDs require shuttling operations in order to maintain effective all-to-all connectivity. Each module or trap can perform only one operation at a time, resulting in low intra-trap parallelism, but there is no restriction on operations happening on independent traps, enabling high inter-trap parallelism. Unlike their superconducting counterparts, the design space for QCCDs is relatively flexible and can be explored beyond current grid designs. In particular, current grid-based architectures significantly limit the performance of many promising, high-rate codes such as HGP codes and BB codes, suffering from numerous trap to trap ``roadblocks", forcing serialization and destroying the inherent parallelism of these codes.. Many of these codes are highly parallelizable, meaning that with appropriate hardware layouts and matching software schedules, execution latency can be reduced. Faster execution, in turn, reduces error accumulation from decoherence and heating, ultimately improving code performance when mapped to realistic hardware. To address this, we propose Cyclone, a circular software-hardware codesign that departs from traditional 2D grids in favor of a flexible ring topology, where ancilla qubits move in lockstep. Cyclone eliminates roadblocks, bounds total movement, and enables high levels of parallelism, resulting in up to ~4$\times$ speedup in execution times. With HGP codes, Cyclone achieves up to a 2$\times$ order of magnitude improvement in logical error rate, and with BB codes, this improvement reaches up to a 3$\times$ in order of magnitude.Spatially, Cyclone reduces the number of required traps and ancilla qubits by $2\times$.The overall spacetime improvement over a standard grid is up to $\sim 20 \times$, demonstrating Cyclone as a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional 2D QCCD architectures.

Conclusion: The work provides an explicit description of stabilizers for k-uniform complete hypergraphs, offering potential applications in quantum error correction and the construction of new Bell inequalities.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method to express the stabilizer of a k-uniform complete hypergraph state as a linear combination of local operators. Quantum hypergraph states generalize graph states and exhibit properties that are not shared by their graph counterparts, most notably, their stabilizers are intrinsically nonlocal, as hyperedges can involve arbitrary subsets of vertices. Our formulation provides an explicit description of the stabilizers for k-uniform complete hypergraphs and may offer new insights for exploring these states within the stabilizer formalism. In particular, this approach could facilitate the construction of new Bell inequalities or find applications in quantum error correction.

Motivation: To address the irreversibility of ensemble-averaged dynamics in open quantum systems by exploring individually monitored quantum trajectories.

Method: Development of quantum reverse diffusion stochastic differential equations and corresponding stochastic master equations for continuously monitored Pauli channels.

Result: Demonstration of exact and approximate reverse diffusion dynamics for continuously monitored Pauli channels, including time-dependent depolarizing noise.

Conclusion: The study establishes a theoretical framework for diffusion-driven quantum gates, quantum tomography, and potential quantum error correction paradigms.

Abstract: The ensemble-averaged dynamics of open quantum systems are typically irreversible. We show that this irreversibility need not hold at the level of individually monitored quantum trajectories. Our main results are quantum reverse diffusion stochastic differential equations, along with corresponding stochastic master equations. These equations describe the exact and approximate reverse diffusion dynamics for continuously monitored Pauli channels, including time-dependent depolarizing noise. Our results bridge the gap between highly nonlinear classical reverse diffusion, prominent in generative modelling, and linear quantum mechanics. Consequently, this establishes a theoretical framework for diffusion-driven quantum gates, quantum tomography via forward-reverse cycles, and potential paradigms for quantum error correction based on reverse diffusion.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A graph-theoretic framework quantifies measurement incompatibility in quantum systems, using graph invariants to derive bounds and identify extremal cases linked to combinatorial structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measurement incompatibility is a fundamental resource in quantum information processing, and quantifying it for large families of binary measurements is essential for understanding quantum systems.

Method: The paper associates anti-commutativity graphs to sets of observables, where vertices represent observables and edges indicate anti-commuting pairs. It uses graph invariants like the Lovász number, clique number, and fractional chromatic number to derive bounds on the incompatibility robustness.

Result: The authors derive general bounds on incompatibility robustness, show asymptotic scaling for k-body Majorana observables, obtain spectral bounds for line graphs, and identify conditions where robustness is determined by simple graph properties.

Conclusion: The study establishes a graph-theoretic framework for quantifying measurement incompatibility in quantum systems, deriving bounds on incompatibility robustness using graph invariants and identifying structural conditions for extremal cases linked to combinatorial structures.

Abstract: Measurement incompatibility--the impossibility of jointly measuring certain quantum observables--is a fundamental resource for quantum information processing. We develop a graph-theoretic framework for quantifying this resource for large families of binary measurements, including Pauli observables on multi-qubit systems and $k$-body Majorana observables on $n$-mode fermionic systems. To each set of observables we associate an anti-commutativity graph, whose vertices represent observables and whose edges indicate pairs that anti-commute. In this representation, the incompatibility robustness--the minimal amount of classical noise required to render the set jointly measurable--becomes a graph invariant. We derive general bounds on this invariant in terms of the Lovász number, clique number, and fractional chromatic number, and show that the Lovász number yields the correct asymptotic scaling for $k$-body Majorana observables. For line graphs $L(G)$, which naturally arise in the characterisation of exactly solvable spin models, we obtain spectral bounds on the robustness expressed through the energy and skew-energy of the underlying graph $G$. These bounds become tight for highly symmetric graphs, leading to closed formulas for several graph families. Finally, we identify structural conditions under which the robustness is determined by a simple function of the graph's maximum degree and the number of vertices and edges, and show that such extremal cases occur only when combinatorial structures such as Hadamard, conference or weighing matrices exist.

Abstract: We propose high-fidelity single-qubit spin-dependent kicks (SDKs) for trapped ions using nanosecond Raman pulses via amplitude modulation of a continuous-wave laser with a tunable beat frequency. We develop a general method for maintaining SDK performance in the presence of micromotion by identifying optimal choices of the RF phase and frequency that suppress unwanted backward kicks. The proposed scheme enables SDK infidelities as low as $10^{-9}$ in the absence of micromotion, and below $10^{-5}$ with micromotion. This study lays the foundation for the realization of sub-trap-period and high-fidelity two-qubit gates based on SDKs.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a computational paradigm that seeks to apply quantum-mechanical resources to solve learning problems. As such, the goal of this framework is to leverage quantum processors to tackle optimization, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, and generative modeling-among other tasks-more efficiently than classical models. Here we offer a high level overview of QML, focusing on settings where the quantum device is the primary learning or data generating unit. We outline the field's tensions between practicality and guarantees, access models and speedups, and classical baselines and claimed quantum advantages-flagging where evidence is strong, where it is conditional or still lacking, and where open questions remain. By shedding light on these nuances and debates, we aim to provide a friendly map of the QML landscape so that the reader can judge when-and under what assumptions-quantum approaches may offer real benefits.

Abstract: We study the universality of work statistics performed during a quench in gapless quantum systems. We show that the cumulants of work scale separately in the fast and slow quench regimes, following a power law analogous to the universal scaling in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for topological defect formation in phase transition. As an example, we analyze the nonequilibrium dynamics of a quenched Heisenberg XXZ chain at its critical gapless state using the bosonization picture, resulting in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. The analytical scaling is in agreement with the exact numerical calculation for the fast and slow quench regimes. In finite systems, the characteristic function display an oscillatory pattern which disappears in the thermodynamic limit. This study is particularly useful for understanding the thermodynamics of adiabatic quantum computation.

Result: qDRIVE effectively identifies resonance energies and wavefunctions in simulated quantum processors with current and planned specifications.

Conclusion: The qDRIVE algorithm, combining quantum computing with classical high-throughput computing, successfully identifies molecular resonance energies and wavefunctions, demonstrating potential applications in fields like photocatalysis and quantum control.

Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum algorithms have reached a state where we can consider how to capitalize on quantum and classical computational resources to accelerate molecular resonance state identification. Here we identify molecular resonances with a method that combines quantum computing with classical high-throughput computing (HTC). This algorithm, which we term qDRIVE (the quantum deflation resonance identification variational eigensolver) exploits the complex absorbing potential formalism to distill the problem of molecular resonance identification into a network of hybrid quantum-classical variational quantum eigensolver tasks, and harnesses HTC resources to execute these interconnected but independent tasks both asynchronously and in parallel, a strategy that minimizes wall time to completion. We show qDRIVE successfully identifies resonance energies and wavefunctions in simulated quantum processors with current and planned specifications, which bodes well for qDRIVE's ultimate application in disciplines ranging from photocatalysis to quantum control and places a spotlight on the potential offered by integrated heterogenous quantum computing/HTC approaches in computational chemistry.

Conclusion: The construction of fixed gadgets for measuring logical Pauli operators on QLDPC codes reduces space overhead significantly without increasing time overhead, making it practical for utility-scale quantum computation.

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes can significantly reduce the overhead of quantum computing, provided the methods for performing logical operations do not require substantial space and time resources. A popular method for performing logical operations is by measuring logical Pauli operators. We present a simple, explicit construction for fixed gadgets that can measure arbitrary logical Pauli operators on QLDPC codes when dynamically connected to the code block. We apply this construction to a family of generalised bicycle codes with distances relevant to utility-scale quantum computation ($10\leq d \leq 24$) and show that it reduces the space overhead by at least an order of magnitude compared to corresponding surface code architectures, without increasing the time overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study free-fermion (XX) chains with site-dependent hoppings and magnetic fields and understand their entanglement entropy suppression.

Method: A discrete WKB-like approximation is applied to the recurrence relation for single-particle eigenfunctions, leading to a closed-form expression for the local fermion density profile.

Result: Derived a closed-form formula for the local fermion density profile, validated in various chains with different hopping and magnetic field profiles.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel analytical approach for studying free-fermion chains, providing a theoretical framework to understand entanglement entropy suppression. The findings represent a significant advancement beyond conventional field-theoretic techniques.

Abstract: We introduce a novel analytical approach for studying free-fermion (XX) chains with smoothly varying, site-dependent hoppings and magnetic fields. Building on a discrete WKB-like approximation applied directly to the recurrence relation for the single-particle eigenfunctions, we derive a closed-form expression for the local fermion density profile as a function of the Fermi energy, which is valid for arbitrary fillings, hopping amplitudes and magnetic fields. This formula reproduces the depletion and saturation effects observed in previous studies of inhomogeneous free-fermion chains, and provides a theoretical framework to understand entanglement entropy suppression in these models. We demonstrate the accuracy of our asymptotic formula in several chains with different hopping and magnetic field profiles. Our findings are thus the first step towards an analytical treatment of entanglement in free-fermion chains beyond the reach of conventional field-theoretic techniques.

TL;DR: Adaptive quantum reprogramming results can be derived from nonadaptive theorems, challenging prior beliefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adaptive reprogramming in the quantum setting and reconcile it with existing nonadaptive results.

Method: The authors analyze and compare existing quantum frameworks for adaptive reprogramming, proposing a counterintuitive connection to the Ambainis-Hamburg-Unruh theorem.

Result: The adaptive results from previous frameworks are shown to follow from the nonadaptive one-way to hiding theorem, contradicting earlier assumptions.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that adaptive reprogramming results in the quantum setting can be derived from the nonadaptive one-way to hiding theorem, challenging previous beliefs.

Abstract: An important proof technique in the random oracle model involves reprogramming it on hard to predict inputs and arguing that an attacker cannot detect that this occurred. In the quantum setting, a particularly challenging version of this considers adaptive reprogramming wherein the points to be reprogrammed (or the output values they should be programmed to) are dependent on choices made by the adversary. Some quantum frameworks for analyzing adaptive reprogramming were given by Unruh (CRYPTO 2014, EUROCRYPT 2015), Grilo-Hövelmanns-Hülsing-Majenz (ASIACRYPT 2021), and Pan-Zeng (PKC 2024). We show, counterintuitively, that these adaptive results follow from the \emph{nonadaptive} one-way to hiding theorem of Ambainis-Hamburg-Unruh (CRYPTO 2019). These implications contradict beliefs (whether stated explicitly or implicitly) that some properties of the adaptive frameworks cannot be provided by the Ambainis-Hamburg-Unruh result.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing qubit mapping algorithms neglect transverse relaxation dynamics (T2), leading to a gap between compiler decisions and evolving noise characteristics in NISQ devices.

Method: TRAM integrates calibration-informed community detection to create noise-resilient qubit partitions, generates time-weighted initial mappings, and dynamically schedules SWAP operations.

Result: TRAM outperforms SABRE by 3.59% in fidelity, reduces gate count by 11.49%, and shortens circuit depth by 12.28%.

Conclusion: TRAM demonstrates significant improvements in fidelity, gate count, and circuit depth, highlighting the importance of coherence-aware optimization in quantum compilation.

Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices impose dual challenges on quantum circuit execution: limited qubit connectivity requires extensive SWAP-gate routing, while time-dependent decoherence progressively degrades quantum information. Existing qubit mapping algorithms optimize for hardware topology and static calibration metrics but systematically neglect transverse relaxation dynamics (T2), creating a fundamental gap between compiler decisions and evolving noise characteristics. We present TRAM (Transverse Relaxation Time-Aware Qubit Mapping), a coherence-guided compilation framework that elevates decoherence mitigation to a primary optimization objective. TRAM integrates calibration-informed community detection to construct noise-resilient qubit partitions, generates time-weighted initial mappings that anticipate coherence decay, and dynamically schedules SWAP operations to minimize cumulative error accumulation. Evaluated on Qiskit-based simulators with realistic noise models, TRAM outperforms SABRE by 3.59% in fidelity, reduces gate count by 11.49%, and shortens circuit depth by 12.28%, establishing coherence-aware optimization as essential for practical quantum compilation in the NISQ era.

Abstract: We demonstrate channel-selective frequency up-conversion from telecom wavelengths around 1540 nm for optical fiber communication to visible wavelengths around 780 nm, based on second-order optical nonlinearity in a cavity of the converted modes. In our experiment, we selectively convert a light from any frequency mode within frequency-multiplexed telecom signals to a desired output mode, determined by the cavity resonances. Based on the experimental results of the frequency up-conversion, we derive the signal-to-noise ratio of the process at the single-photon level, and discuss its applicability to channel-selective quantum frequency conversion (CS-QFC) in the context of frequency-multiplexed quantum networks.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) are an analog of classical neural networks in the world of quantum computing, which are represented by a unitary matrix with trainable parameters. Inspired by the universal approximation property of classical neural networks, ensuring that every continuous function can be arbitrarily well approximated uniformly on a compact set of a Euclidean space, some recent works have established analogous results for QNNs, ranging from single-qubit to multi-qubit QNNs, and even hybrid classical-quantum models. In this paper, we study the approximation capabilities of QNNs for periodic functions with respect to the supremum norm. We use the Jackson inequality to approximate a given function by implementing its approximating trigonometric polynomial via a suitable QNN. In particular, we see that by restricting to the class of periodic functions, one can achieve a quadratic reduction of the number of parameters, producing better approximation results than in the literature. Moreover, the smoother the function, the fewer parameters are needed to construct a QNN to approximate the function.

Abstract: Optomechanics with levitated nanoparticles is a promising way to combine very different types of quantum non-Gaussian aspects induced by continuous dynamics in a nonlinear or time-varying potential with the ones coming from discrete quantum elements in dynamics or measurement. First, it is necessary to prepare quantum non-Gaussian states using both methods. The nonlinear and time-varying potentials have been widely analyzed for this purpose. However, feasible preparation of provably quantum non-Gaussian states in a single mechanical mode using discrete photon detection has not been proposed yet for optical levitation. We explore pulsed optomechanical interactions combined with non-linear photon detection techniques to approach mechanical Fock states and confirm their quantum non-Gaussianity. We also predict the conditions under which the optomechanical interaction can induce multiple-phonon addition processes, which are relevant for $n$-phonon quantum non-Gaussianity. The practical applicability of quantum non-Gaussian states for sensing phase-randomized displacements is shown. Besides such applications, generating quantum non-Gaussian states of levitated nanoparticles can help to study fundamental questions of quantum thermodynamics, and macroscopic quantum effects.

Abstract: Quantum computing faces a key challenge: balancing the need for low circuit depth (crucial for fault tolerance) with the high accuracy required for complex computations like quantum chemistry and error correction, which typically require deeper circuits. We overcome this trade-off by introducing a novel reinforcement learning approach featuring engineered reward functions, called \textbf{QASER}, that take into account seemingly contradictory optimization goals. This reward enables the compilation of circuits with lower depth and higher accuracy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Benchmarks on quantum chemistry state preparation circuits demonstrate stable compilations. We achieve up to 50\% improved accuracy, while reducing 2-qubit gate counts and depths by 20\%.

Conclusion: The study highlights the sensitivity of energy storage in free fermion quantum batteries to their quantum phase transitions, with potential implications for stabilizing stored energy and optimizing charging protocols.

Abstract: Quantum batteries are quantum mechanical systems able to store and release energy in a controlled fashion. Among them, a special role is played by quantum structures defined as networks of two-level systems. In this context, it has recently been shown that the energy stored in free fermion quantum batteries is sensitive to the quantum phase diagram of the battery itself. This sensitivity is relevant for stabilizing the stored energy and designing optimal charging protocols. In this article, we explore universal charging behaviors of free fermion quantum batteries across quantum phase transitions. We first analyze a Dirac cone-like model to extract general features. Then, we verify our findings by means of two relevant lattice models, namely the Ising chain in a transverse field and the Haldane model.

Abstract: Optical cavities provide a powerful means to engineer light-matter hybrid states by coupling confined electromagnetic fields with matter excitations. Achieving in situ control of the coupling strength is essential for investigating how such hybridization evolves with the coupling strength. In this work, we use a symmetry-changing structural phase transition in lead halide perovskites to reversibly tune the phonon-photon coupling strength, leveraging the fact that their phonon frequencies and oscillator strengths are dictated by lattice symmetry. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy of MAPbI3 embedded in nanoslot cavities reveals three polariton branches above the critical temperature Tc = 162.5 K, and the emergence of an additional branch below Tc, activated by a new phonon mode in the low-temperature phase. The full dispersion is accurately reproduced using a multimode Hopfield model, confirming that all normalized coupling strengths remain in the ultrastrong coupling regime. These results demonstrate symmetry-controlled tuning of ultrastrong coupling via phonon engineering in optical cavities.

Conclusion: Medusa通过优化标志比特的容错能力，显著降低了量子电路的总体故障率，并证明在加法器类型电路中能有效扩展其性能。

Abstract: Quantum circuits will experience failures that lead to computational errors. We introduce Medusa, an automated compilation method for lowering a circuit's failure rate. Medusa uses flags to predict the absence of high-weight errors. Our method can numerically upper bound the failure rate of a circuit in the presence of flags, and fine tune the fault-tolerance of the flags in order to reach this bound. We assume the flags can have an increased fault-tolerance as a result of applying surface QECs to the gates interacting with them. We use circuit level depolarizing noise to evaluate the effectiveness of these flags in revealing the absence of the high-weight stabilizers. Medusa reduces the cost of quantum-error-correction (QEC) because the underlying circuit has a lower failure rate. We benchmark our approach using structured quantum circuits representative of ripple-carry adders. In particular, our flag scheme demonstrates that for adder-like circuits, the failure rate of large-scale implementations can be lowered to fit the failure rates of smaller-scale circuits. We show numerically that a slight improvement in the local fault-tolerance of the flag-qubits can lead to a reduction in the overall failure rate of the entire quantum circuit.

TL;DR: Analysis of driven quantum thermal machines shows geometric and dissipative contributions, with a heat-pumping bound for non-interacting qubits that can be exceeded via interactions and asymmetric couplings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the thermodynamic behavior of quantum thermal machines, especially the roles of qubit interactions and asymmetric couplings in heat currents and entropy production, and to derive bounds analogous to the Landauer limit.

Method: A detailed analysis using the Lindblad master equation with a systematic expansion in the driving rate, separating geometric and dissipative contributions identified by Berry curvature and a metric in parameter space.

Result: Derived explicit expressions for work rates, heat currents, and entropy production up to second order. Found that geometric heat pumped per cycle is bounded by $k_B T N_q \\ln 2$ for non-interacting qubits, and this bound can be surpassed with interactions and asymmetric couplings.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing driven quantum thermal machines, highlighting the importance of qubit interactions and asymmetric couplings in surpassing traditional thermodynamic bounds and optimizing device performance.

Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of slowly driven quantum thermal machines based on interacting qubits within the framework of the Lindblad master equation. By implementing a systematic expansion in the driving rate, we derive explicit expressions for the rate of work of the driving forces, the heat currents exchanged with the reservoirs, and the entropy production up to second order, ensuring full thermodynamic consistency in the linear-response regime. The formalism naturally separates geometric and dissipative contributions, identified by a Berry curvature and a metric in parameter space, respectively. Analytical results show that the geometric heat pumped per cycle is bounded by $k_B T N_q \ln 2$ for $N_q$ non-interacting qubits, in direct analogy with the Landauer limit for entropy change. This bound can be surpassed when qubit interactions and asymmetric couplings to the baths are introduced. Numerical results for the interacting two-qubit system reveal a non-trivial role of the interaction between qubits and the coupling between the qubits and the baths in the behavior of the dissipated power. The approach provides a general platform for studying dissipation, pumping, and performance optimization in driven quantum devices operating as heat engines.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand the optimal rates of emulation (interconversion) between quantum channels, particularly for idempotent channels.

Method: The method involves analyzing structural properties of the range of idempotent quantum channels to derive a single-letter expression for the zero-error emulation capacity.

Result: A single-letter expression for the zero-error emulation capacity is derived for idempotent channels, highlighting non-reversibility and matching strong converse rates in certain scenarios.

Conclusion: The study shows that channel emulation is not reversible for general idempotent channels and establishes a strong converse rate matching the zero-error emulation capacity in specific cases.

Abstract: We study the optimal rates of emulation (also called interconversion) between quantum channels. When the source and the target channels are idempotent, we give a single-letter expression for the zero-error emulation capacity in terms of structural properties of the range of the two channels. This expression shows that channel emulation is not reversible for general idempotent channels. Furthermore, we establish a strong converse rate that matches with the zero-error emulation capacity when the source or the target channel is either an identity or a completely dephasing channel.

Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum computers encode qubits in individually trapped atoms arranged in optical lattices. Achieving defect-free atom configurations is essential for high-fidelity quantum gates and scalable error correction, yet stochastic loading and atom loss during rearrangement hinder reliable large-scale assembly. This work presents ATLAS, an open-source atom transport algorithm that efficiently converts a randomly loaded $W \times W$ lattice into a defect-free $L \times L$ subarray while accounting for realistic physical constraints, including finite acceleration, transfer time, and per-move loss probability. In the planning phase, optimal batches of parallel moves are computed on a lossless virtual array; during execution, these moves are replayed under probabilistic atom loss to maximize the expected number of retained atoms. Monte Carlo simulations across lattice sizes $W=10$--$100$, loading probabilities $p_{\mathrm{occ}}=0.5$--$0.9$, and loss rates $p_{\mathrm{loss}}=0$--$0.05$ demonstrate fill rates above $99\%$ within six iterations and over $90\%$ atom retention at low loss. The algorithm achieves sublinear move scaling ($\propto M^{0.55}$) and linear growth of required initial size with target dimension, outperforming prior methods in robustness and scalability -- offering a practical path toward larger neutral-atom quantum arrays.

Conclusion: The on-chip encoding converter can serve as a foundational component in the future quantum internet, bridging the gap between quantum information transmission and on-chip processing based on photons.

Abstract: The development of quantum internet demands on-chip quantum processor nodes and interconnection between the nodes. Path-encoded photonic qubits are suitable for on-chip quantum information processors, while time-bin encoded ones are good at long-distance communication. It is necessary to develop an on-chip converter between the two encodings to satisfy the needs of the quantum internet.

The performance of the encoding converter is demonstrated by the experiment of time-bin to path encoding conversion on the fabricated sample chip. The converted path qubits have an average fidelity higher than 97%. The potential of the encoding converter on applications in quantum networks is demonstrated by the experiments of entanglement distribution and quantum key distribution.

Result: The study identified parameter regimes for maximal tripartite quantum correlations and demonstrated how dissipative rates and detuning asymmetries enable the conversion of bipartite entanglement into a tripartite state.

Conclusion: The paper outlines a clear path for engineering steady-state multipartite quantum resources in coupled cavity QED systems, with applications in quantum networking and distributed quantum information processing.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the emergence and control of genuine tripartite entanglement in a hybrid cavity quantum electrodynamics architecture consisting of two linearly coupled single mode resonators, one of which interacts coherently with a two level atom. An analytical framework is developed in a weak driving regime, where the system dynamically supports a delocalized hybrid excitation shared by the two photonic modes and the atomic degree of freedom. Tripartite concurrence fill has been used to characterize and identify parameter regimes of maximal multipartite quantum correlation that can be generated in this model. Additionally, we demonstrate how dissipative rates and detuning asymmetries govern the conversion of bipartite entanglement into a genuinely tripartite state, establishing a controllable transition from localized Jaynes Cummings correlations to delocalized photonic atomic entanglement networks. These findings outline a clear route to engineering steady state multipartite quantum resources in coupled cavity QED platforms, with direct relevance to quantum networking, distributed quantum information processing, and photonic state routing in scalable quantum architectures.

Motivation: The study aims to simplify the identification of $W$ states, a key multipartite entangled state, by leveraging quantum uncertainty relations instead of traditional state tomography.

Method: The authors employ a set of non-commuting observables to formulate an uncertainty-based criterion for identifying $W$ states and demonstrate its generality in distinguishing them from other entangled states.

Result: The proposed method successfully identifies $W$ states efficiently using uncertainty inequalities, distinguishing them from other tripartite entangled states like the GHZ state.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel theoretical tool for identifying tripartite $W$ states using quantum uncertainty relations, highlighting their importance in entanglement characterization without requiring full state tomography.

Abstract: The $W$ state, a canonical representative of multipartite quantum entanglement, plays a crucial role in quantum information science due to its robust entanglement properties. Quantum uncertainty relations, on the other hand, are a fundamental cornerstone of quantum mechanics. This paper introduces a novel approach to Identifying tripartite $W$ states by leveraging tripartite quantum uncertainty relations. By employing a specific set of non-commuting observables, we formulate an uncertainty-based criterion for identifying $W$ states and rigorously demonstrate its generality in distinguishing them from other tripartite entangled states, such as the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. Our approach bypasses the need for complete quantum state tomography, as it requires only the verification of a set of uncertainty inequalities for efficient $W$-state identification. This work provides a new theoretical tool for identifying multipartite entangled states and underscores the significant role of quantum uncertainty relations in entanglement characterization.

Motivation: The development of quantum computers threatens classical cryptography, and QKD networks face operational difficulties such as dynamic adaptation, multi-parameter optimization, and resource utilization.

Method: A GNN-based framework is proposed to model QKD networks as dynamic graphs, extracting exploitable characteristics from their structure, including topological information and quantum communication-specific features.

Result: Experimental results show a significant increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and improved link prediction accuracy in medium-sized networks.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Networks using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) framework. Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance.

Result: Established a direct link between quantum speed limits and quantum coherence, including a complementary relation for the speed of three mutually unbiased observables for a single qubit.

Conclusion: The research provides a derived formulation of quantum speed limits for observables, highlighting its relevance in weak measurements and quantum metrology, and introduces a quantum thermodynamic speed limit as an application.

Abstract: Quantum asymmetry and coherence are genuinely quantum resources that are essential to realize quantum advantage in information technologies. However, all quantum processes are fundamentally constrained by quantum speed limits, which raises the question on the corresponding bounds on the rate of consumption of asymmetry and coherence. In the present work, we derive a formulation of the quantum speed limit for observables in terms of the trace-norm asymmetry of the time-dependent quantum state relative to the observable. This version of the quantum speed limit can be shown to be directly relevant in weak measurements and quantum metrology. It can be further related to quantum coherence relative to the observable, and we obtain a complementary relation for the speed of three mutually unbiased observables for a single qubit. As an application, we derive a notion of a quantum thermodynamic speed limit.

Abstract: Two-mode squeezing is central to entangled-photon generation and nonlinear interferometry, yet standard perturbative low-gain and Gaussian treatments obscure how photon-number amplitudes interfere, especially in multi-crystal geometries and at high gain. Here, we derive the exact analytic action of the two-mode squeezing operator on arbitrary Fock states to analyze nonlinear interferometers directly in the number basis at arbitrary squeezing strength. Within this framework, we find new physical interpretations of previously known quantum interference effects, and theoretically discover a new and unusual multi-photon interference effect in an experimental four-crystal geometry that could readily be observed in laboratories.

Motivation: The challenge of designing quantum circuit ansatzes for any problem instance, not just specific ones, motivated the development of a non-greedy RL approach to generate adaptable circuits.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework is used to learn a problem-dependent quantum circuit mapping, which generates circuits for ground states of Hamiltonians from a given family. The method is applied to lithium hydride and H$_4$ chains.

Result: The RL method effectively produces quantum circuits for ground states of lithium hydride (4-qubit and 6-qubit) and an 8-qubit H$_4$ chain, with the circuits being interpretable and problem-dependent.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning (RL) approach successfully generates interpretable, problem-dependent quantum circuits for ground states of molecular systems, demonstrating its potential for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Quantum chemistry and optimization are two of the most prominent applications of quantum computers. Variational quantum algorithms have been proposed for solving problems in these domains. However, the design of the quantum circuit ansatz remains a challenge. Of particular interest is developing a method to generate circuits for any given instance of a problem, not merely a circuit tailored to a specific instance of the problem. To this end, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to learning a problem-dependent quantum circuit mapping, which outputs a circuit for the ground state of a Hamiltonian from a given family of parameterized Hamiltonians. For quantum chemistry, our RL framework takes as input a molecule and a discrete set of bond distances, and it outputs a bond-distance-dependent quantum circuit for arbitrary bond distances along the potential energy curve. The inherently non-greedy approach of our RL method contrasts with existing greedy approaches to adaptive, problem-tailored circuit constructions. We demonstrate its effectiveness for the four-qubit and six-qubit lithium hydride molecules, as well as an eight-qubit H$_4$ chain. Our learned circuits are interpretable in a physically meaningful manner, thus paving the way for applying RL to the development of novel quantum circuits for the ground states of large-scale molecular systems.

Method: The paper introduces OpenQudit, a framework using the Qudit Gate Language (QGL) for symbolic operation definition, tensor network representation, and e-graph-based simplification, with a TNVM for JIT compilation.

Result: OpenQudit achieves up to 20x acceleration in core instantiation tasks for quantum circuit synthesis.

Conclusion: OpenQudit's symbolic approach and efficient compilation framework significantly accelerate quantum circuit synthesis, demonstrating up to 20x speedup compared to existing tools.

Abstract: High-performance numerical quantum compilers rely on classical optimization, but are limited by slow numerical evaluations and a design that makes extending them with new instructions a difficult, error-prone task for domain experts. This paper introduces OpenQudit, a compilation framework that solves these problems by allowing users to define quantum operations symbolically in the Qudit Gate Language (QGL), a mathematically natural DSL. OpenQudit's ahead-of-time compiler uses a tensor network representation and an e-graph-based pass for symbolic simplification before a runtime tensor network virtual machine (TNVM) JIT-compiles the expressions into high-performance native code. The evaluation shows that this symbolic approach is highly effective, accelerating the core instantiation task by up to $\mathtt{\sim}20\times$ on common quantum circuit synthesis problems compared to state-of-the-art tools.

Motivation: Atom loss in long chains of trapped ions destabilizes the entire chain, leading to the loss of all qubits in the chain, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: The study employs a distributed [[72,12,6]] BB code with beacon qubits to detect and correct chain losses, followed by circuit-level simulations to validate the approach.

Result: The proposed solution successfully addresses chain loss by converting it into erasures using beacon qubits and correcting the combined effects of circuit faults and erasures.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme, combining quantum error correction codes, beacon qubits, and an adapted decoder, effectively mitigates the impact of atom loss in long ion chains, as demonstrated by simulations using a distributed [[72,12,6]] BB code.

Abstract: Neutral atom quantum computers and to a lesser extent trapped ions may suffer from atom loss. In this work, we investigate the impact of atom loss in long chains of trapped ions. Even though this is a relatively rare event, ion loss in long chains must be addressed because it destabilizes the entire chain resulting in the loss of all the qubits of the chain. We propose a solution to the chain loss problem based on (1) a quantum error correction code distributed over multiple long chains, (2) beacon qubits within each long chain to detect the loss of a chain, and (3) a decoder adapted to correct a combination of circuit faults and erasures after beacon qubits convert chain losses into erasures. We verify the chain loss correction capability of our scheme through circuit level simulations with a distributed $[[72,12,6]]$ BB code with beacon qubits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in Bayesian multiparameter quantum estimation, particularly the role of measurement incompatibility and its impact on precision.

Method: The framework utilizes the pretty good measurement and the Nagaoka-Hayashi lower bound to derive upper bounds and analyze the effect of measurement incompatibility.

Result: Incompatibility can at most double the minimum loss relative to idealized scenarios, and the idealized scenario may serve as a computationally efficient benchmark.

Conclusion: The study provides analytical and numerical tools to assess the ultimate precision limits in Bayesian multiparameter quantum estimation, highlighting the role of measurement incompatibility. It also offers an open-source package for practical evaluations.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive and pedagogical formulation of Bayesian multiparameter quantum estimation, providing explicit conditions for achieving minimum quadratic losses. Within this framework, we analyse the role of measurement incompatibility and establish its quantitative effect on attainable precision. We achieve this by deriving upper bounds based on the pretty good measurement -- a notion originally developed for hypothesis testing -- combined with the evaluation of the Nagaoka-Hayashi lower bound. In general, we prove that, as in the many-copy regime of local estimation theory, incompatibility can at most double the minimum loss relative to the idealised scenario in which individually optimal measurements are assumed jointly implementable. This result implies that, in many practical situations, the latter may provide a sufficient and computationally efficient benchmark without solving the full optimisation problem. Our results, which we illustrate through a range of applications, including discrete quantum phase imaging, phase and dephasing estimation, and qubit sensing, provide analytical and numerical tools for assessing ultimate precision limits and the role of measurement incompatibility in Bayesian multiparameter quantum metrology. We also provide an open-source package that implements all bounds discussed here, enabling practical evaluation and comparison across quantum metrological models.

Motivation: To achieve reproducible fabrication of twisted van der Waals heterostructures, particularly for air-sensitive materials like BSCCO, while preserving their superconducting properties.

Method: The method utilizes silicon nitride nanomembranes (NMBs) with pre-patterned electrodes and the cryogenic stacking technique (CST) to prevent thermal and chemical degradation.

Result: The fabricated junctions show twist-angle-dependent Josephson coupling with performance comparable to the highest-reported devices, enabled by a scalable and adaptable contact method.

Conclusion: The innovative dry, inert, and cryogenic assembly method, combined with symmetric membrane designs, successfully addresses reproducibility challenges in fabricating high-quality twisted BSCCO Josephson junctions. It highlights the critical role of interface and contact engineering in superconducting van der Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: Controlled fabrication of twisted van der Waals heterostructures is essential to unlock the full potential of moire materials. However, achieving reproducibility remains a major challenge, particularly for air-sensitive materials such as $Bi_{2}Sr_{2}CaCu_{2}O_{8+δ}$ (BSCCO), where it is crucial to preserve the intrinsic and delicate superconducting properties of the interface throughout the entire fabrication process. Here, we present a dry, inert and cryogenic assembly method that combines silicon nitride nanomembranes (NMBs) with pre-patterned electrodes and the cryogenic stacking technique (CST) to fabricate high-quality twisted BSCCO Josephson junctions (JJs). This protocol prevents thermal and chemical degradation during both interface formation and electrical contact integration. We also find that asymmetric membrane designs, such as a double cantilever, effectively suppress vibration-induced disorder due to wire bonding, resulting in sharp and hysteretic current-voltage characteristics. The junctions exhibit a twist-angle-dependent Josephson coupling with magnitudes comparable to the highest-performing devices reported to date, but achieved through a straightforward and versatile contact method, offering a scalable and adaptable platform for future applications. These findings highlight the importance of both interface and contact engineering in addressing reproducibility in superconducting van der Waals heterostructures.

TL;DR: d-wave symmetry in 2D superconductors enhances phase stiffness and BKT transition temperature compared to s-wave, driven by nodal lines in the Brillouin zone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of d-wave symmetry in enhancing the phase stiffness and BKT transition temperature in strongly coupled two-dimensional superconductors compared to nodeless-gap superconductors.

Method: Based on mean-field and BKT theory, the study conducts a comparative analysis of s-wave and d-wave superconductors, focusing on mean-field critical temperature and maximum superconducting gap related to pairing strengths. It also presents phase diagrams and zero-temperature phase-stiffness intensity maps.

Result: The d-wave scenario shows enhanced stiffness and higher T_{BKT} due to nodal lines in the Brillouin zone. The phase diagram illustrates the scaling of T_{BKT} with the mean-field critical temperature and the evolution of the pseudogap. The zero-temperature phase-stiffness map reveals a two-component structure dependent on microscopic parameters.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the d-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap enhances the phase stiffness and BKT transition temperature (T_{BKT}) compared to s-wave superconductors, due to extended regions of vanishing gap around the nodal lines of the Brillouin zone. This provides a mechanism for higher stiffness and elevated T_{BKT} in strongly coupled two-dimensional superconductors.

Abstract: We reveal the key role of the $d$-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap in strongly coupled two-dimensional superconductors in determining the properties of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, associated with a sizable enhancement of the phase stiffness compared to nodeless-gap superconductors. The enhanced stiffness originates from extended regions of vanishing gap around the nodal lines of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Our study, based on mean-field and BKT theory, presents a comparative analysis of $s$-wave and $d$-wave scenarios, highlighting the features of the latter that boost the stiffness and the BKT transition temperature (T$_{BKT}$). The comparison focuses on two quantities: the mean-field critical temperature and the maximum superconducting gap related to the pairing strengths. We present a phase diagram showing the scaling of T$_{BKT}$ with respect to the mean-field critical temperature across the BCS-BEC crossover and the evolution of the pseudogap. We also present a zero-temperature phase-stiffness intensity map over the Brillouin zone, displaying a two-component structure consisting of low- and high-stiffness regions whose extent depends on microscopic parameters. These results identify the nodal gap structure of strongly coupled two-dimensional superconductors as a key mechanism enabling enhanced stiffness and elevated T$_{BKT}$ compared to their $s$-wave counterparts.

TL;DR: The study explores the effect of a c-axis magnetic field on YBa2Cu3O7−δ, showing shifts in transition temperatures and pseudogap behavior, confirming vortex state formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the stronger influence of a magnetic field directed along the c-axis compared to the ab-plane due to combined spin-orbit and Zeeman effects, and to observe the field's impact on the superconducting properties and pseudogap behavior.

Method: The research involved analyzing the resistivity, fluctuation conductivity, and pseudogap in YBa2Cu3O7−δ thin films under a magnetic field up to 9 T directed along the c-axis. The effects were studied against the field's influence.

Result: The BEC-BCS transition temperature shifted to lower temperatures with increasing field, and the pseudogap maximum decreased significantly above 5 T. The low-temperature maximum near T0 disappeared at B > 1 T, and a pronounced minimum appeared above TG, indicating pair-breaking effects.

Conclusion: The study confirms the formation and evolution of a vortex state in YBa2Cu3O7−δ under a magnetic field along the c-axis, highlighting the significant impact of the field on the pseudogap, fluctuation conductivity, and resistivity.

Abstract: The work analyzes the effect of a magnetic field $B$ directed along the $c$ axis ($B \parallel c$) up to 9~T on the resistivity $ρ(T)$, fluctuation conductivity (FLC) $σ'(T)$ and pseudogap $Δ^*(T)$ in thin films of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ with a critical temperature of the superconducting transition $T_c = 88.8$~K. In contrast to previous work, where the magnetic field was directed along the $ab$ plane ($B \parallel ab$), the influence of the field on the sample is stronger due to the contribution of both spin--orbit and Zeeman effects. It was found that the BEC--BCS transition temperature, $T_{\mathrm{pair}}$, which corresponds to the maximum of the $Δ^*(T)$ dependence, shifts to the region of lower temperatures with increasing $B$, and the maximum value of $Δ^*(T_{\mathrm{pair}})$ decreases in fields $B > 5$~T. It was found that with increasing field, the low-temperature maximum near $T_0$ is smeared and disappears at $B > 1$~T. In addition, above the Ginzburg temperature $T_G$, for $B > 1$~T, a minimum appears on $Δ^*(T)$ at $T_{\min}$, which becomes very pronounced with a subsequent increase in $B$. As a result, the overall value of $Δ^*(T_G)$ decreases noticeably, most likely due to the pair-breaking effect. At the same time, $ΔT_{\mathrm{fl}}$ and $ξ_c(0)$ increase sharply by approximately 3 times with increasing $B$ above 1~T. Our results confirm the possibility of the formation of a vortex state in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ by a magnetic field and its evolution with increasing $B$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The instability of twisted cuprate heterostructures under ambient conditions and their vulnerability to conventional characterization tools necessitated a non-invasive method for measuring twist angles.

Method: The research utilized a high-resolution confocal Raman setup with polarization control and RayShield filtering to analyze twist-dependent anisotropic vibrational Raman modes, focusing on the out-of-plane A1g vibrational mode of Bi/Sr at 116 cm-1.

Result: Clear optical fingerprints of the rotational misalignment between cuprate layers were identified, enabling reliable and reproducible measurements without damaging the material.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a non-invasive, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy approach for accurately determining twist angles in BSCCO heterostructures, preserving the material's structural integrity.

Abstract: Artificially engineered twisted van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have unlocked new pathways for exploring emergent quantum phenomena and strongly correlated electronic states. Many of these phenomena are highly sensitive to the twist angle, which can be deliberately tuned to tailor the interlayer interactions. This makes the twist angle a critical tunable parameter, emphasizing the need for precise control and accurate characterization during device fabrication. In particular, twisted cuprate heterostructures based on Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x have demonstrated angle-dependent superconducting properties, positioning the twist angle as a key tunable parameter. However, the twisted interface is highly unstable under ambient conditions and vulnerable to damage from conventional characterization tools such as electron microscopy or scanning probe techniques. In this work, we introduce a fully non-invasive, polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy approach for determining twist angles in artificially stacked BSCCO heterostructures. By analyzing twist-dependent anisotropic vibrational Raman modes, particularly utilizing the out-of-plane A1g vibrational mode of Bi/Sr at 116 cm-1, we identify clear optical fingerprints of the rotational misalignment between cuprate layers. Our high-resolution confocal Raman setup, equipped with polarization control and RayShield filtering down to 10 cm-1, allows for reliable and reproducible measurements without compromising the material's structural integrity.
