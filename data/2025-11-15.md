  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether ordinary lattice defects, despite their topological triviality, can act as probes for the non-trivial topology of electronic bands and changes in local topological environments.

Method: Implemented a minimal model Hamiltonian for topological and normal insulators on a square lattice with point defects, and experimentally observed defect-bound mid-gap modes in 2D acoustic Chern lattices.

Result: Defect-bound mid-gap modes are robust against weak charge impurities, and experimental observations in acoustic Chern lattices confirm the theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: Ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands. This study provides theoretical and experimental evidence for their role in topology, suggesting potential applications in topological superconductors and engineered devices.

Abstract: In addition to topological lattice defects such as dislocations and disclinations, crystals are also accompanied by unavoidable ordinary defects, devoid of any non-trivial geometry or topology, among which vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs are the most common. In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices.

### [2] [Impacts of Decoder Latency on Utility-Scale Quantum Computer Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10633)

TL;DR: A model shows reaction time in quantum computing's classical electronics significantly affects error rates and resource needs, requiring microarchitecture optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of classical electronics reaction time on the performance and design of logical microarchitecture in fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Method: The authors build a model for reaction time in a surface code-based architecture, incorporating parallel decoding methods and communication latencies from a high-speed network environment.

Result: The model estimates increased logical error rates and substantial resource overheads (e.g., additional physical qubits and longer runtime) under realistic hardware conditions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significant impact of reaction time on the logical error rate and resource overhead in quantum computers, suggesting the need for optimized microarchitecture to handle these challenges.

Abstract: The speed of a fault-tolerant quantum computer is dictated by the reaction time of its classical electronics, that is, the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine the outcome of a logical measurement and execute subsequent conditional logical operations. Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times. For circuits with $10^{6}$--$10^{11}$ $T$ gates involving 200--2000 logical qubits, under a $Λ=9.3$ hardware model representative of a realistic target for superconducting quantum processors operating at a 2.86 MHz stabilization frequency, we show that even decoding at a sub-microsecond per stabilization round speed introduces substantial resource overheads: approximately 100k--250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage in the magic state factory; 300k--1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor due to the code distance increase of $d$ to $d+4$ for extra memory protection; and a longer runtime by roughly a factor of 100.

### [3] [Emergent spin order and steady-state superradiance in one-dimensional baths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10638)
*Silvia Cardenas-Lopez,Edgar Guardiola-Navarrete,Ana Asenjo-Garcia*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates how competition and propagation affect superradiance in one-dimensional reservoirs, revealing distinct synchronization and phase ordering behaviors in ring cavities and waveguides.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether spontaneous collective decay-induced coherence and superradiance can persist in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing decay channels, moving beyond the Dicke limit.

Method: The researchers analyzed atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths using two models: a ring cavity with two bright collective decay channels and a bidirectional waveguide with competing decay channels and dipole-dipole interactions.

Result: For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window, leading to steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. The ring cavity exhibits spontaneous chirality at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops local chirality with different orders at opposite ends.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that steady-state superradiance can emerge in one-dimensional reservoirs despite competition and propagation effects, with distinct behaviors in ring cavities and waveguides.

Abstract: Spontaneous collective decay in driven atomic ensembles can generate coherence far from equilibrium, as illustrated by superradiant lasers where decay into a single-mode cavity synchronizes atomic phases into a macroscopic dipole and yields superradiant emission of light with an ultranarrow spectrum. Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit.

### [4] [Supernematic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10642)
*Dan Mao,Eun-Ah Kim*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A geometrically frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice leads to a supernematic phase through global symmetry breaking, driven by combinatorial constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how geometrical frustration in quantum systems can enforce a global conserved quantity and lead to new macroscopically phase-coherent states, particularly in frustrated bosonic models on the honeycomb lattice.

Method: The approach involves a quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems treated as a gauge theory, with the local conservation law serving as the Gauss law. The study rigorously links microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state via a non-perturbative tiling invariant.

Result: The mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number (sublattice polarization $	ilde{N} = N_A - N_B$), leading to a supernematic (SN) phase—an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without topological order.

Conclusion: The study establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints, specifically identifying the supernematic (SN) phase as a result of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Abstract: Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints.
