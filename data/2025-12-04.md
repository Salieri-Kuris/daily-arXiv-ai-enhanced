TL;DR: A Ginzburg-Landau model for cuprates links short-range charge modulation to d-wave superconductivity, predicting enhanced superfluid stiffness and specific STM/STS signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the distinct behavior of a short-range modulated electron lattice (MEL) state in high-Tc cuprates and its connection to superconducting coherence, contrasting it with long-range charge density wave order.

Method: Develops a Ginzburg-Landau framework coupling a short-range charge density modulation to a d-wave superconducting condensate, using classical Monte Carlo simulations and parameters from optimally doped YBa2Cu3O7-δ.

Result: The framework predicts an MEL enhancement window where modulation boosts superfluid stiffness, identifies a preferred wave vector q* ≈ 0.3, and proposes falsifiable experimental signatures for STM/STS.

Conclusion: The MEL framework provides a phenomenological explanation for the interplay between charge modulation and superconductivity in cuprates, offering testable predictions for experimental signatures in STM/STS and correlations between MEL properties and superconducting behavior.

Abstract: We develop a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for high-$T_c$ cuprates in which a short-range modulation of the electronic charge density couples to a $d$-wave superconducting condensate. The resulting modulated electron lattice (MEL) state is distinct from long-range static charge density wave order: it is short range, partially phase coherent, and linked to superconducting coherence. A preferred wave vector $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ reciprocal lattice units along the Cu-O bond direction emerges from the interplay between a momentum-dependent susceptibility and bond-stretching phonons, consistent with neutron and x-ray data on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ and related cuprates. The GL free energy contains coupled $d$-wave superconducting and charge sectors with parameters constrained by optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$. We identify an MEL enhancement window in doping, temperature, MEL correlation length, and disorder where a coherence linked modulation enhances the superfluid stiffness. Classical Monte Carlo simulations yield an in-plane stiffness enhancement of order ten percent, which we treat as a qualitative prediction to be tested by self-consistent Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations. The MEL framework yields falsifiable experimental signatures. For scanning tunneling spectroscopy in Bi-based cuprates we highlight two predictions: the Fourier-transformed local density of states should exhibit a $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ peak whose spectral weight sharpens as superconducting phase coherence develops below $T_c$, in contrast to static charge scenarios, and the local gap magnitude $Δ(r)$ should correlate positively with the local MEL amplitude. The framework implies correlations between MEL correlation length, superfluid stiffness, disorder, and vortex pinning, and organizes cuprate observations into testable STM/STS predictions.

Abstract: The cuprate Hg0.8Tl0.2Ba2Ca2Cu3O8.33 exhibits the highest superconducting transition temperature Tc of 138K. Achieving superconductivity at even higher temperatures, up to room temperature, represents the ultimate dream of humanity. As temperature increases, Cooper pairs formed through weak electron-phonon coupling will be disintegrated by the thermal motion of electrons, severely limiting the enhancement of Tc. It is imperative to explore new strong-coupling pairing pictures and establish novel condensation mechanism of Cooper pairs at higher temperature. Based on our recently proposed groundbreaking idea of electron e- (hole h+) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, namely, the eV-scale ionic-bond-driven atom-bridge (bridge-I) e--O-e- (h+-M-h+) strong-coupling itinerant Cooper pairing formed at pseudogap temperature T*>Tc in ionic oxide superconductors, we further discover that there is an attractive interaction between two Cooper pairs induced by the bridge atom (bridge-II) located between them. It is this attraction mediated by the bridge-II atoms that promotes all the Cooper pairs within the CuO2 plane to hold together and enter the superconducting state at Tc finally. Moreover, according to the Bose-Einstein condensation theory, we find that Tc is inversely proportional to the effective mass m* of Cooper pairs, directly proportional to n2/3s (ns: the density of Cooper pairs), and linearly increases with the scattering length a<0 due to attraction between two Cooper pairs. Therefore, according to our double-bridge mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity, increasing the attraction between Cooper pair and bridge-II atom, ensuring that ns takes the optimal value, and minimizing the effective mass of the Cooper pairs are the main approaches to enhancing Tc of ionic-bonded superconductors, which opens up a new avenue with clear direction for designing higher Tc superconductors.

Abstract: The prediction of superconductivity above 200 K in CaH6 revolutionized research on hydrogen-rich superconductors, and subsequent experiments have verified this prediction, while unidentified peaks in XRD and the decrease in superconducting temperature upon decompression indicate that unresolved issues remain. In this work, we combine theory and experiment to construct an accurate temperature-pressure phase diagram of the Ca-H system and identify the stability ranges of the candidate superconducting phases by considering anharmonic effects. Our results demonstrate that type-I clathrate Ca8H46-delta structures become thermodynamically stable at 0 K when anharmonic effects are considered. Notably, we found that the previously predicted CaH6 phase achieves stability above 500 K, underscoring the significant role of temperature and anharmonic effects in stabilizing this intriguing high-pressure phase. Experimentally, we have successfully synthesized Ca8H46-delta phases at low temperatures, thereby validating our theoretical predictions. Our findings offer insights into the structure and superconducting mechanisms of hydrides.

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Study of KMn$_6$Bi$_5$ reveals unique magnetotransport behaviors, including non-saturating magnetoresistance and temperature-dependent carrier dynamics, highlighting the interplay of dimensionality, magnetism, and electron correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate emergent quantum phenomena produced by the interactions among spin, charge, and lattice in quasi-one-dimensional materials $A$Mn$_6$Bi$_5$ ($A$ = Na, K, Rb, Cs).

Method: Report the magnetotransport properties of KMn$_6$Bi$_5$, revealing a cascade of temperature-dependent carrier dynamics.

Result: The system exhibits a large, non-saturating magnetoresistance below 5 K, driven by an isotropic two-band model. A crossover to a single-band regime occurs around 20 K, and electron density recovers as antiferromagnetic gap openings close from 25 to 70 K. Field-quenched spin fluctuations suppress magnetoresistance within this range.

Conclusion: These findings provide crucial insights into the interplay of dimensionality, magnetism, and electron correlations in quasi-one-dimensional magnetic semimetals.

Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional materials $A$Mn$_6$Bi$_5$ ($A$ = Na, K, Rb, Cs) exhibit unique electronic behaviors such as antiferromagnetism, charge density waves, and pressure-induced superconductivity. Thus, they serve as a suitable model system to investigate emergent quantum phenomena produced by the interactions among spin, charge, and lattice. Here we report the magnetotransport properties of KMn$_6$Bi$_5$, revealing a cascade of temperature-dependent carrier dynamics. Below 5 K, the system, despite its anisotropic electronic structure, could be effectively described by an isotropic two-band model and exhibits a large, non-saturating magnetoresistance ($\propto B^{1.8}$). Upon warming, a crossover to a single-band regime occurs around 20 K, driven by the suppression of a hole pocket. Electron density recovers as antiferromagnetic gap openings gradually close from 25 to 70 K which is just below the N$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$el temperature. Within this temperature range, field-quenched spin fluctuations suppress magnetoresistance. Furthermore, we attribute the low-temperature resistivity upturn to the scaling behavior of magnetoresistance. These findings provide crucial insights into the interplay of dimensionality, magnetism, and electron correlations in quasi-one-dimensional magnetic semimetals.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the realization of topological superconductivity and Majorana modes by inducing superconducting correlations in magnetic topological insulators (MTIs).

Method: Developed an analytical model for the proximity effect in MTI thin films using a perturbative approach with respect to electron tunneling between MTI and SC, deriving the leading-order correction to the anomalous Green's function.

Result: Derived explicit expressions for the decay length of pairing amplitude and showed enhanced spin-polarized triplet components and p-wave contributions due to increased magnetization, resolving the spatial, spin, and momentum structure of induced superconducting order.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that increasing magnetization enhances spin-polarized triplet components and p-wave contributions in MTI films, highlighting the interplay between topology, magnetism, and superconductivity, and providing analytical insights for realizing Majorana modes.

Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) is emerging as a promising route toward the realization of topological superconductivity and Majorana modes. Here, we develop an analytical model for the proximity effect induced by an ordinary s-wave superconductor (SC) placed on top of a MTI thin film with finite thickness. Using a perturbative approach with respect to the electron tunneling between MTI and SC, we derive the leading-order correction to the anomalous Green's function and evaluate the position-dependent induced pairing as a function of all the system parameters. This framework allows us to resolve the spatial, spin, and momentum structure of the induced superconducting order parameter. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for the decay length of the pairing amplitude at the $k_x=k_y=0$ point, and show that increasing magnetization enhances the spin-polarized triplet components and the p-wave contributions of the anomalous Green's function. These findings highlight the interplay between topology, magnetism, and superconductivity in MTI films, providing analytical insight into the emergence of unconventional pairing symmetries relevant for the realization of Majorana modes in finite geometries.

### [6] [Highly Anisotropic Charge Dynamics and Spectral Weight Redistribution in the Trilayer Nickelate La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03806)
*Zhe Liu,Jie Li,Deyuan Hu,Bingke Ji,Haoran Zhang,Jiahao Hao,Yaomin Dai,Qing Li,Mengjun Ou,Bing Xu,Yi Lu,Meng Wang,Hai-Hu Wen*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ exhibits highly anisotropic charge dynamics with metallic $ab$-plane and semiconducting $c$-axis behavior, strong electronic correlations, and significant resistivity anisotropy, deviating from theoretical predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the anisotropic charge dynamics and electronic correlations in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, particularly comparing it with other materials like iron-based superconductors and high-$T_{c}$ cuprates.

Method: Optical spectroscopy was used to analyze the $ab$-plane and $c$-axis charge dynamics of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, including the extrapolation of zero-frequency optical conductivity and investigation of spectral weight transfer.

Result: A resistivity anisotropy of $ρ_{c}/ρ_{ab} \simeq 366$ at 300 K was observed, with anisotropic interband responses and evidence of strong electronic correlations. The interband-transition peaks were found at lower energies than predicted by density-functional theory.

Conclusion: The study reveals significant anisotropic charge dynamics in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ with metallic behavior in the $ab$-plane and semiconducting behavior along the $c$-axis. The observed resistivity anisotropy and interband response highlight strong electronic correlations, which are further evidenced by deviations from density-functional-theory predictions.

Abstract: We study the $ab$-plane and $c$-axis charge dynamics of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using optical spectroscopy. While a pronounced Drude profile, i.e. metallic response, is observed in the $ab$-plane optical conductivity $σ_{1}^{ab}(ω)$, the $c$-axis optical spectra $σ_{1}^{c}(ω)$ exhibit semiconducting behavior. The zero-frequency extrapolation of the optical conductivity $σ_{1}(ω\rightarrow 0) \equiv 1/ρ_{\text{dc}}$ gives a resistivity anisotropy of $ρ_{c}/ρ_{ab} \simeq 366$ at 300 K for La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, which is much larger than the values in iron-based superconductors but comparable to those in high-$T_{c}$ cuprates. The interband response is also highly anisotropic, showing salient orbital selectivity for light polarized in the $ab$ plane and along the $c$ axis. The interband-transition peaks in both $σ_{1}^{ab}(ω)$ and $σ_{1}^{c}(ω)$ are located at lower energies compared to density-functional-theory predictions, signifying considerable electronic correlations. By investigating the spectral weight transfer, we find that in the pristine phase, Coulomb correlations have a marked impact on the charge dynamics of \LNO, whereas in the density-wave state, a gap opens with the Ni-$d_{z^{2}}$ orbital being involved.

Additionally, three meta-stable boron clathrates were predicted by removing U atoms, including C2/m-B6 (hardness 49-53 GPa) and C2/m-B12 (superconducting with Tc of 16.12 K).

Conclusion: The study enriches the phase diagram of binary metal borides and boron allotropes, providing insights for future theoretical and experimental studies on unique materials.

Abstract: The binary metal borides provide a promising platform for searching unique materials with superconductivity and super-hardness under high pressure, owing to the distinctive bonding characters of boron. In this work, combined the first-principles calculations and crystal structure predictions, we predicted 4 exotic stoichiometries and 8 unique U-B compounds under high pressure. The predicted compounds have layered or caged structure units and 4 of them host high hardness under ambient pressure. By removal of the U atoms, we predicted three meta-stable boron clathrates at ambient pressure. Remarkably, the Vickers hardness of the predicted C2/m-B6 is estimated to be 49-53 GPa, and the C2/m-B12 is superconducting with the Tc value of 16.12 K. Our calculations enrich the phase diagram of binary metal borides and boron allotropes, providing insights for the future theoretical and experimental studies on unique materials.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates chiral superconductivity in UPt₃ through the observation of half-quantum vortices and domain-like structures using a SQUID microscope.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the unconventional superconductivity in UPt₃ and understand the behavior of vortices in chiral superconductors.

Method: Investigating UPt₃ with a scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope under varying magnetic fields.

Result: Observation of mobile half-quantum vortices, one quantum vortices, and magnetic contrast resembling domain walls.

Conclusion: The study confirms the theoretical predictions for chiral superconductivity in UPt₃, showing the coexistence of half-quantum vortices and one quantum vortices, as well as domain-like structures.

Abstract: Superconductivity is characterized by vanishing electrical resistance and magnetic flux expulsion. For conventional type II superconductors, the magnetic flux expulsion is incomplete in an applied magnetic field above a critical value and magnetic flux penetrates the bulk of the superconductor in discrete quantized magnetic flux tubes (vortices), each carrying a single quantum of flux (h/2e). Investigating the unconventional superconductor UPt$_{3}$ with a scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope, we observed mobile half-quantum vortices together with one quantum vortices. Cooling the material under a higher magnetic field revealed the presence of lines of magnetic contrast resembling domain walls. These observations agree with theoretical predictions for chiral superconductivity with a two dimensional complex order-parameter with sheets of half-quantum vortices separating domains of opposite order-parameter chirality.

*Henry Mittenzwey,Oliver Voigt,Andreas Knorr*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper explores excitonic dynamics in confined semiconductors, finding weaker Rabi oscillations in Coulomb-dominated regimes and suppression under linear excitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the ultrafast optical response of confined semiconductors at high densities below the Mott transition, distinguishing between coherent and incoherent regimes.

Method: The paper employs an excitonic approach and numerical simulations to analyze the ultrafast optical response of confined semiconductors, comparing moderate and strong Coulomb interaction regimes.

Result: Results show that excitonic Rabi oscillations are less pronounced in the Coulomb-dominated regime and nearly absent under linear excitation in a MoSe₂ monolayer.

Conclusion: The study concludes that excitonic Rabi oscillations are significantly suppressed in the Coulomb-dominated regime and almost completely suppressed under linear excitation in a MoSe₂ monolayer.

Abstract: An excitonic approach to the ultrafast optical response of confined semiconductors at elevated densities below the Mott transition is presented. The theory is valid from the coherent regime, where coherent excitonic transitions and biexcitons dominate, to the incoherent regime, where excitonic occupations dominate. Numerical simulations of the $1s$ exciton dynamics during intense circularly polarized pump pulses in two different Coulomb-interaction regimes are performed for two-dimensional semiconductors: Moderate Coulomb interaction is compared with dominating Coulomb interaction with respect to the light-matter interaction strength. The different many-body contributions are disentangled and it is found, that excitonic Rabi oscillations in the Coulomb-dominated regime are considerably less strong. By also comparing circular and linear excitation in a MoSe$_2$ monolayer, it is found, that linear excitation creates a regime, where excitonic Rabi oscillations are almost completely suppressed.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A new framework simplifies the analysis of magneto-fluorescence by enabling precise averaging over molecular orientations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dependency of triplet excitons and color-centers fluorescence on magnetic fields is complex, and existing methods limit analytical understanding and complicate experimental analysis.

Method: Development of a framework for analytical averaging over triplet molecular orientations, including numerical and semi-analytical approximations.

Result: The framework provides accurate numerical routines and semi-analytical approximations for modeling magneto-fluorescence lineshapes.

Conclusion: The presented framework enables precise analytical averaging over triplet molecular orientations, enhancing the understanding and modeling of magneto-fluorescence lineshapes.

Abstract: The fluorescence of triplet excitons and color-centers is strongly dependent on magnetic field that mixes the zero field spin eigenstates that determine the radiative recombination rates back into the singlet ground state through spin-orbit coupling. For films of molecules, and polycristaline color-centers samples an average over molecular orientations has to be performed to model the magneto-fluorescence lineshapes. This limits our analytical understanding of the lineshapes and complicates the analysis of the fluorescence dependence on magnetic field. Here, we present a framework that allows to average over triplet molecular orientations analytically. Our approach achieves provides very accurate numerical routines computing precisely the averages matrix elements that appear in magneto-fluorescence and semi-analytical approximations that can be used to model experimental traces.

Conclusion: These findings open opportunities for 2D magnetic semiconductors to address limitations in contemporary computing.

Abstract: Integrating semiconducting and magnetic materials could combine transistor-like operation with nonvolatility and enable architectures such as logic-in-memory. Here, we employ correlated electrical transport and scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetic imaging to elucidate a spin transistor concept that amalgamates both vertical and lateral transport in a 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor, distinct from purely vertical tunneling devices. Our device, based on a monolayer-bilayer junction in CrSBr, displays giant, gate-tunable magnetoresistance driven by the dual action of electrostatic doping on space-charge-limited lateral conduction and interlayer exchange coupling. Moreover, we visualize a field-trainable, layer-sharing effect that selects between coherent or domain-wall reversal at the spin-flip transition, enabling multilevel, memristive conductance states. These findings open opportunities for 2D magnetic semiconductors to address limitations in contemporary computing.

Conclusion: 通过调控交替磁体（AMs）的耦合强度，可以实现高阶拓扑相的可控性，为基于边缘模式的器件应用提供了多功能平台。

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework to engineer hybrid-order and higher-order topological phases in three-dimensional topological insulators by coupling to $d$-wave altermagnets (AMs). Presence of only $d_{x^2-y^2}$-type AM drives the system into a hybrid-order topological phase where both first-order and second-order topological phases coexist. This phase is characterized by spectral analysis, low-energy surface theory, dipolar and quadrupolar winding numbers, and it's signature is further confirmed by two-terminal differential conductance calculations. Incorporation of the $d_{x^2-z^2}$-type AM drives the system into two second-order topological insulator phases hosting distinct type of hinge modes. They are also topologically characterized by spectral analysis, topological invariants, low-energy surface thoery, and transport calculations. Importantly, the localization and direction of propagation of these one-dimensional hinge modes are controllable by tuning the relative strengths of the alermagnetic exchange orders. We utilize this feature to propose a tunable current-switching behaviour mediated via the hinge modes. Our results establish AMs based hybrid structure as a versatile platform for controllable higher-order topology and hinge-mediated device applications.

Method: A simulation tool was developed to numerically study the effects of device imperfections on spin-coherence during conveyor-mode shuttling, considering factors like defect locations, orbital states, and electron-phonon interactions.

Result: The study provides insights into the critical defect density and the influence of single defects on spin qubit coherence, aiding the development of robust shuttle devices.

Conclusion: The simulation identifies the critical defect density for coherent spin qubit shuttling and quantifies the impact of single defects on qubit coherence in Si/SiGe heterostructures.

Abstract: Recent advances in coherent conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttling are paving the way for large-scale quantum computing platforms with qubit connectivity achieved by spin qubit shuttles. We developed a simulation tool to investigate numerically the impact of device imperfections on the spin-coherence of conveyor-mode shuttling in Si/SiGe. We simulate the quantum evolution of a mobile electron spin-qubit under the influence of sparse and singly charged point defects placed in the Si/SiGe heterostructure in close proximity to the shuttle lane. We consider different locations of a single charge defect with respect to the center of the shuttle lane, multiple orbital states of the electron in the shuttle with $g$-factor differences between the orbital levels, and orbital relaxation induced by electron-phonon interaction. With this simulation framework, we identify the critical defect density of charged point defects in the heterostructure for conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttle devices and quantify the impact of a single defect on the coherence of a qubit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To experimentally demonstrate the role of quantum geometry in stabilizing fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effects and switching between distinct correlated topological phases.

Method: Experimental exploration using high-quality 3.7° twisted MoTe2 (tMoTe2) devices with combined transport and optical measurements, along with exact diagonalization (ED) calculations.

Result: Observation of topological electronic crystal (TEC) states with integer quantized Hall conductance at specific fillings, showing a transition from CFL-like states to TEC states, facilitated by quantum geometry tuning.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates experimental evidence of quantum geometry-driven switching between correlated topological phases in twisted MoTe2, specifically between FQAH/CFL and TEC phases, and highlights its potential for further exploration of correlation-driven topological phenomena.

Abstract: The quantum geometry of Bloch wavefunctions,encoded in the Berry curvature and quantum metric, is believed to be a decisive ingredient in stabilizing fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect(i.e., fractional Chern insulator, FCI, at zero magnetic field), against competing symmetry-breaking phases.A direct experimental demonstration of quantum geometry-driven switching between distinct correlated topological phases, however, has been lacking. Here, we report experimental evidence of such a switch in a high-quality 3.7 twisted MoTe2 (tMoTe2) device consisting of both A-A bilayer and A-AB trilayer regions. While composite Fermi liquid CFL/FQAH phases are established in A-A tMoTe2,the A-AB region-effectively an A-A moire bilayer proximitized by a remote B layer-develops a series of topological electronic crystal (TEC, also referred to as generalized QAH crystal, QAHC) states with integer quantized Hall conductance at commensurate fractional fillings v=1/2, 2/3, and an incommensurate filling factor v=0.53.The electrostatic phase diagram is mapped out by combined transport and optical measurements, showing that these TEC states emerge within the first moir'e valence band prior to any charge transfer to the B layer. Exact diagonalization (ED) incorporating the remote-layer-induced intralayer potential demonstrates a transition from a CFL-like manifold in the A-A limit to a Chern number C=1 ground-state consistent with a TEC at v=1/2 , accompanied by the further breakdown of ideal band geometry. Our results provide experimental evidence of quantum geometry-tuned competition between FQAH/CFL and TEC phases in a moiré Chern band and pave the way for further exploring correlation-driven topological phenomena by tuning quantum geometry.

Abstract: In recent years, the concept of multipoles has been widely used to describe and classify various magnetic and electric responses in solids, providing a systematic way to identify symmetry-allowed or -forbidden physical responses. Conventionally, multipole classifications rely on the magnetic point group of a system, which inherently incorporates the effects of relativistic spin-orbit coupling because the spin orientation is supposed to follow the point-group transformation of the lattice. However, this approach becomes insufficient in situations where relativistic spin-orbit coupling is negligibly weak or where the spin and orbital (lattice) degrees of freedom are decoupled, thereby requiring a more comprehensive symmetry description. In this work, we introduce a multipole description on the basis of spin-point-group symmetries, enabling a systematic exploration of nonrelativistic phenomena that persist even without spin-orbit coupling in a collinear antiferromagnet. As an application, we theoretically demonstrate spin-current generation driven by elastic waves in a specific collinear antiferromagnet, fully independent of spin-orbit coupling.

Motivation: To explore the efficiency and tunability of 2D antiferromagnets in MTJs for advanced spintronic applications.

Method: Utilizing A-type antiferromagnetic FCGT as electrodes in van der Waals MTJs, the study investigates the spin selectivity and interfacial effects, including the SSF effect.

Result: A tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of ~25% at low current (1 nA) and near room temperature, with tunable amplitude and sign under varying bias currents and temperatures.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of 2D antiferromagnets, specifically FCGT, for spintronic devices through precise magnetoelectric manipulation in MTJs, achieving tunable TMR and memory behaviors.

Abstract: The utilization of two-dimensional (2D) materials in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) has shown excellent performance and rich physics. As for 2D antiferromagnets, the magnetic moments in different layers respond asynchronously and can be configured at various states under different magnetic fields, showing the possibility of efficient magnetic and electrical tunability. In this report, A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) material (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2 (FCGT) works as electrodes to realize full van der Waals magnetic tunnel junctions. Owing to the interfacial effect, the even-layer FCGT, although with zero net magnetization, exhibits spin selectivity in MTJ architecture contributing to a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) reaching about 25% at a low operating current 1 nA at 100 K and persists near room temperature. Due to the surface spin-flop (SSF) effect in antiferromagnetic FCGT, the alternation flexibility between the volatile and nonvolatile memory behavior is achieved. The interfacial TMR can be tuned efficiently in amplitude and even sign under different bias currents and temperatures. These findings show precise magnetoelectric manipulation in MTJs based on 2D antiferromagnets and highlight the promise of 2D antiferromagnets for spintronic devices.

Motivation: To explore the unique transport phenomena in altermagnets, a new class of collinear magnetic materials with $C_n\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, and to uncover their quantum geometric properties.

Method: The researchers demonstrate that an in-plane magnetic field lifts the prohibition of conventional second-order responses in altermagnets, inducing planar magnetotransport to probe quantum geometry and $C_n\mathcal{T}$ symmetry.

Result: The field-dependent quantum geometric susceptibility generates versatile planar magnetotransport, including planar Hall effects and nonreciprocal responses.

Conclusion: The study establishes distinctive signatures of altermagnetism in linear and nonlinear magnetotransport, offering a framework for measuring quantum geometric responses and probing altermagnetic order.

Abstract: Nonlinear and nonreciprocal transport phenomena provide a direct probe of band quantum geometry in noncentrosymmetric magnetic materials, such as the nonlinear Hall effect induced by the quantum metric dipole. In altermagnets, a recently discovered class of even-parity collinear magnets with $C_n\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, conventional second-order responses are prohibited by an emergent $C_{2z}$ symmetry. In this work, we demonstrate that an in-plane magnetic field lifts this prohibition, inducing a planar magnetotransport that directly probes the intrinsic quantum geometry and the distinctive $C_n\mathcal{T}$ nature of altermagnetic orders. We show that the field-dependent quantum geometric susceptibility generates versatile planar magnetotransport, including the planar Hall effects and nonreciprocal responses. Our work establishes distinctive signatures of altermagnetism in linear and nonlinear magnetotransport, providing a general framework for measuring quantum geometric responses and probing altermagnetic order.

TL;DR: A hybrid graphene device with magnetic barriers and a laser-driven Floquet cavity shows tunable electron transport, Fano resonances, and perfect transmission under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and control electron transport in graphene when subjected to magnetic barriers and laser-driven Floquet cavities, exploring new transport channels and interference effects.

Method: Floquet theory combined with the transfer matrix method is used to analyze electron transmission through the main energy band and photon-assisted sidebands.

Result: The system exhibits Fano resonances, angle-dependent transmission zeros, and tunable resonances with perfect transmission under specific conditions. Low-energy carriers are blocked by magnetic regions, while conductance rises with energy to a saturation plateau.

Conclusion: The hybrid design combining magnetic barriers and a laser-driven Floquet cavity provides a versatile method to control electron transport in graphene, balancing optical pumping and magnetic filtering to achieve tunable resonances and perfect transmission under specific conditions.

Abstract: We study how electrons move across a graphene sheet when it encounters two magnetic barriers with a region in between that is continuously driven by laser light. Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering.

Motivation: To explore high-order fractional quantum Hall states in electron bilayers and understand their behavior under controlled conditions.

Method: Experimental realization of high-order 2C-FQH states using an in-plane magnetic field in an ultra-high-mobility GaAs quantum well.

Result: Discovery of symmetric and unbalanced high-order 2C-FQH states, with many unbalanced states being more robust than their balanced counterparts.

Conclusion: The findings expand the landscape of 2C-FQH states and open new avenues for studying symmetry, topology, and interactions in quantum Hall systems.

Abstract: Two-component fractional quantum Hall (2C-FQH) states in electron bilayers have been known for decades, yet their experimental realization remained limited to low-order fractions. Here we report on several families of high-order 2C-FQH states that emerge when an in-plane magnetic field drives a controlled monolayer-to-bilayer transition in an ultra-high-mobility GaAs quantum well. These families of states proliferate symmetrically toward the filling factor $ν= 1$, from both $ν= 2/3$ and $ν= 4/3$, thereby respecting particle-hole symmetry. Surprisingly, many unbalanced states (with unequal layer fillings) are more robust than their parent balanced states, defying the expected hierarchy of Jain sequences. Our findings substantially expand the known landscape of 2C-FQH states, highlighting the unexpected richness of the bilayer quantum Hall regime and opening new routes for probing the interplay of symmetry, topology, and interactions in quantum Hall systems.

Motivation: To understand and control the interfacial exchange coupling in buried AFM-FM interfaces, which remains challenging despite the potential of two-dimensional magnets.

Method: Utilizing scanning nitrogen-vacancy centre (NV) magnetometry to distinguish antiphase even-layer states and visualize nanoscale AFM domains.

Result: Successful demonstration of interfacial control in CrPS4, switching AFM domains adjacent to FM-like regions, and achieving tunable multilevel exchange bias.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates interfacial control in layered AFM CrPS4 through intralayer exchange coupling, revealing the microscopic origins of exchange bias and advancing applications in hybrid AFM-FM technologies.

Abstract: Interfacial exchange coupling between antiferromagnets (AFMs) and ferromagnets (FMs) crucially makes it possible to shift the FM hysteresis, known as exchange bias, and to switch AFM states. Two-dimensional magnets unlock opportunities to combine AFM and FM materials; however, the buried AFM-FM interfaces obtained by stacking remains challenging to understand. Here we demonstrate interfacial control via intralayer exchange coupling in the layered AFM CrPS$_4$, where connected even and odd layers realize pristine lateral interfaces between AFM-like and FM-like regions. We distinguish antiphase even-layer states by scanning nitrogen-vacancy centre (NV) magnetometry due to a weak surface magnetization. This surface magnetization enables control over the even-layer state, with different regions switching at distinct fields due to their own lateral couplings. We toggle three AFM domains adjacent to a FM-like region and demonstrate a tunable multilevel exchange bias. Our nanoscale visualization unveils the microscopic origins of exchange bias and advances single two-dimensional crystals for hybrid AFM-FM technologies.

Conclusion: The study confirms the 2D nature of quantum oscillations in MnBi2Te4 nanostructures, demonstrating an alternative method to photoemission spectroscopy for studying topological surface states in magnetic topological insulators using Landau level spectroscopy.

Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators can host chiral 1D edge channels at zero magnetic field, when a magnetic gap opens at the Dirac point in the band structure of 2D topological surface states, lead- ing to the quantum anomalous Hall effect in ultra-thin nanostructures. For thicker nanostructures, quantization is severely reduced by the co-existence of edge states with other quasi-particles, usually considered as bulk states. Yet, surface states also exist above the magnetic gap, but it remains difficult to identify electronic subbands by electrical measurements due to strong disorder. Here we unveil surface states in MnBi2Te4 nanostructures, using magneto-transport in very-high magnetic fields up to 55 T, giving evidence of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations above 40 T. A detailed analysis confirms the 2D nature of these quantum oscillations, thus establishing an alternative method to photoemission spectroscopy for the study of topological surface states in magnetic topological insulators, using Landau level spectroscopy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The black-box nature of GNNs limits their deployment in scenarios requiring transparency, while existing Shapley value methods are computationally intractable for real-world graphs.

Method: Leveraging amplitude amplification for quadratic speedups in coalition evaluation, QGShap avoids approximation trade-offs common in classical methods.

Result: Empirical evaluations show QGShap achieves consistently high fidelity and explanation accuracy, matching or exceeding classical methods.

Conclusion: QGShap provides a quantum computing approach for exact Shapley value computation in GNNs, achieving high fidelity and accuracy while maintaining interpretability and structural consistency.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become indispensable in critical domains such as drug discovery, social network analysis, and recommendation systems, yet their black-box nature hinders deployment in scenarios requiring transparency and accountability. While Shapley value-based methods offer mathematically principled explanations by quantifying each component's contribution to predictions, computing exact values requires evaluating $2^n$ coalitions (or aggregating over $n!$ permutations), which is intractable for real-world graphs. Existing approximation strategies sacrifice either fidelity or efficiency, limiting their practical utility. We introduce QGShap, a quantum computing approach that leverages amplitude amplification to achieve quadratic speedups in coalition evaluation while maintaining exact Shapley computation. Unlike classical sampling or surrogate methods, our approach provides fully faithful explanations without approximation trade-offs for tractable graph sizes. We conduct empirical evaluations on synthetic graph datasets, demonstrating that QGShap achieves consistently high fidelity and explanation accuracy, matching or exceeding the performance of classical methods across all evaluation metrics. These results collectively demonstrate that QGShap not only preserves exact Shapley faithfulness but also delivers interpretable, stable, and structurally consistent explanations that align with the underlying graph reasoning of GNNs. The implementation of QGShap is available at https://github.com/smlab-niser/qgshap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inherent probabilistic nature (50% success rate) of fusion processes in constructing large entangled cluster states for measurement-based quantum computing, especially in scenarios with low loss.

Method: The protocol involves using single quantum emitters to generate redundantly encoded photonic resource states and analyzing the impact of errors and photonic losses on these states and type-II photonic fusion.

Result: Demonstrated that redundant encoding using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states can boost fusion success probability to near unity in low-loss conditions.

Conclusion: The study provides a protocol for deterministically generating redundantly encoded photonic resource states, addressing the challenges of probabilistic fusion and loss. It highlights the potential for efficient construction of complex entangled states in photonic quantum computing and quantum repeaters.

Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computing relies on the generation of large entangled cluster states that act as a universal resource on which logical circuits can be imprinted and executed through local measurements. A number of strategies for constructing sufficiently large photonic cluster states propose fusing many smaller resource states generated by a series of quantum emitters. However, the fusion process is inherently probabilistic with a 50% success probability in standard guise. A recent proposal has shown that, in the limit of low loss, the probability of achieving successful fusion may be boosted to near unity by redundantly encoding the vertices of linear graph states using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states [Quantum 7, 992 (2023)]. Here we present a protocol for deterministically generating redundantly encoded photonic resource states using single quantum emitters, and study the impact of protocol errors and photonic losses on the generated resource states and type-II photonic fusion. Our work provides a route for efficiently constructing complex entangled photonic qubit states for photonic quantum computing and quantum repeaters.

Motivation: To verify key thermal assumptions (e.g., Gibbs-distributed output ensemble) in quantum annealers and assess their capability as experimental platforms for strongly correlated spin systems.

Method: Experimental and quantitative assessment of Gibbs sampling fidelity across varying system sizes, coupling strengths, annealing times, and hardware architectures.

Result: A non-negligible, coupling-independent offset in the effective temperature scaling law was found, indicating residual non-thermal effects. A systematic discrepancy between inferred physical temperature and nominal cryogenic temperature was observed.

Conclusion: The study systematically assesses the viability of quantum annealers for probing classical thermodynamics, corrects previous assumptions, and provides a thermometry framework for future experiments.

Abstract: Quantum annealers are emerging as programmable, dynamical experimental platforms for probing strongly correlated spin systems. Yet key thermal assumptions, chiefly a Gibbs-distributed output ensemble, remain unverified in the large-scale regime. Here, we experimentally and quantitatively assess Gibbs sampling fidelity across system sizes spanning over three orders of magnitude. We explore a wide parameter space of coupling strengths, system sizes, annealing times, and D-wave hardware architectures. We find that the naively assumed scaling law for the effective temperature requires a non-negligible, coupling-independent offset that is robust across machines and parameter regimes, quantifying residual non-thermal effects that still conform to an effective Gibbs description. These non-idealities are further reflected in a systematic discrepancy between the physical temperature inferred from the sampled ensemble and the nominal cryogenic temperature of the device. Our results systematically assess the viability of quantum annealers as experimental platforms for probing classical thermodynamics, correct previous assumptions, and provide a physically grounded thermometry framework to benchmark these machines for future thermodynamic experiments.

Motivation: Addressing the need for parallel qubit readouts in scaling quantum computers by improving stability and signal quality.

Method: Utilizes the multi-tone self-phase-referenced Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique for superconducting-qubit readout, employing room-temperature heterodyne detection.

Result: PDH readout shows 0.73° phase stability over 2 hours, insensitivity to microwave phase drift, and a potential 14 dB signal enhancement over traditional methods.

Conclusion: The PDH readout method demonstrates high phase stability and signal enhancement, making it a promising approach for scalable quantum computing.

Abstract: Scaling quantum computers to large sizes requires the implementation of many parallel qubit readouts. Here we present an ultrastable superconducting-qubit readout method using the multi-tone self-phase-referenced Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique, originally developed for use with optical cavities. In this work, we benchmark PDH readout of a single transmon qubit, using room-temperature heterodyne detection of all tones to reconstruct the PDH signal. We demonstrate that PDH qubit readout is insensitive to microwave phase drift, displaying $0.73^\circ$ phase stability over 2 hours, and capable of single-shot readout in the presence of phase errors exceeding the phase shift induced by the qubit state. We show that the PDH sideband tones do not cause unwanted measurement-induced state transitions for a transmon qubit, leading to a potential signal enhancement of at least $14$~dB over traditional heterodyne readout.

TL;DR: The paper redefines the energy cost assessment for counterdiabatic driving by proposing a non-zero excess work interpretation, illustrated with the Landau-Zener model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of quantifying the energy cost of counterdiabatic driving, which traditionally appears to be energetically cost-free.

Method: The paper proposes using the instantaneous excess work and time-averaged excess work to assess the energy cost of counterdiabatic driving. It also reinterprets the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian to achieve a non-zero excess work.

Result: The speed-up of counterdiabatic driving is linked to the spreading of energy between eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. A reinterpretation of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian parameters recovers the excess work as a non-zero energetic cost quantifier.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a different interpretation of the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian allows the excess work to serve as a non-zero energetic cost quantifier for counterdiabatic driving.

Abstract: Many years have passed since the conception of the quintessential method of shortcut to adiabaticity known as counterdiabatic driving (or transitionless quantum driving). Yet, this method appears to be energetically cost-free and thus continually challenges the task of quantifying the amount of energy it demands to be accomplished. This paper proposes that the energy cost of controlling a closed quantum system using the counterdiabatic method can also be assessed using the instantaneous excess work during the process and related quantities, as the time-averaged excess work. Starting from the Mandelstam-Tamm bound for driven dynamics, we have shown that the speed-up of counterdiabatic driving is linked with the spreading of energy between the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, which is necessarily accompanied by transitions between these eigenstates. Nonetheless, although excess work can be used to quantify energetically these transitions, it is well known that the excess work is zero throughout the entire process under counterdiabatic driving. To recover the excess work as an energetic cost quantifier for counterdiabatic driving, we will propose a different interpretation of the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, leading to an excess work different from zero. We have illustrated our findings with the Landau-Zener model.

Motivation: To investigate quench dynamics in a quantum XXZ antiferromagnetic chain with staggered and anisotropic interactions, and to validate findings through quantum computing experiments.

Method: Analytic derivation in the Bell basis for exact time-dependent states and numerical experiments using Hadamard tests and Trotter-error-free time-evolution circuits on IBM-Q devices.

Result: Closed-form expressions for entanglement entropies and Loschmidt echoes, identification of Loschmidt zeros, and successful experimental validation on quantum devices.

Conclusion: The study provides exact and numerical results for quench dynamics in a quantum XXZ antiferromagnetic chain, revealing conditions for dynamical periodicity and successfully demonstrating experimental validation on IBM-Q devices.

Abstract: We investigate quench dynamics in the quantum $S=1/2$ XXZ antiferromagnetic chain with staggered and anisotropic interactions in the flat-band limit. Our quench protocol interchanges the odd- and even-bond strengths of a fully dimerized chain, enabling us to derive exact time-dependent states for arbitrary even system sizes by working in the Bell basis. We obtain closed-form, size-independent expressions for the von Neumann and second-order Rényi entanglement entropies. We further calculate exact Loschmidt echoes and the corresponding return rate functions across various anisotropies and system sizes, and identify Loschmidt zeros in finite chains. Our analysis reveals the precise conditions on the anisotropy parameter that govern the periodicity of the dynamical observables. In addition to the analytic study, we perform two types of numerical experiments on IBM-Q quantum devices. First, we use the Hadamard test to estimate the Bell-basis expansion coefficients and reconstruct the dynamical states, achieving accurate entanglement entropies and the Loschmidt echo for small systems. Second, we implement Trotter-error-free time-evolution circuits combined with randomized Pauli measurements. Post-processing via statistical correlations and classical shadows yields reliable estimates of the second-order Rényi entanglement entropy and the Loschmidt echo, showing satisfactory agreement with exact results.

Motivation: To understand the quantum resource requirements for training machine learning models on fluid dynamics data and identify efficient computational approaches.

Method: The study investigates entanglement and non-stabilizerness in MPS-encoded functions derived from simulations of 2D, periodic, incompressible shear flow, analyzing computational complexity across different flow regimes.

Result: The shear width indicates a transition between resource-efficient and resource-intensive regimes, with entanglement and non-stabilizerness evolving similarly over time. Mesh resolution and sign structure significantly affect resource requirements.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the quantum resource requirements for simulating fluid dynamics and offers guidelines for developing scalable, quantum-inspired approaches.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum resource requirements of a dataset generated from simulations of two-dimensional, periodic, incompressible shear flow, aimed at training machine learning models. By measuring entanglement and non-stabilizerness on MPS-encoded functions, we estimate the computational complexity encountered by a stabilizer or a tensor network solver applied to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations across different flow regimes. Our analysis reveals that, under specific initial conditions, the shear width identifies a transition between resource-efficient and resource-intensive regimes for non-trivial evolution. Furthermore, we find that the two resources qualitatively track each other in time, and that the mesh resolution along with the sign structure play a crucial role in determining the resource content of the encoded state. These findings offer useful guidelines for the development of scalable, quantum-inspired approaches to fluid dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calibration schemes for analog quantum simulators are tailored to digital gate characterization and cannot effectively learn continuous pulse trajectories, necessitating a new approach to achieve high-fidelity time-dependent pulse control.

Method: The study extends the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) framework to analyze time-dependent pulses and combines it with a logical-level analog-digital mapping paradigm to reconstruct smooth pulses directly from time-ordered propagator queries, avoiding mid-circuit measurements or additional evolution.

Result: The method avoids performance degradation from accumulated local truncation errors, as demonstrated through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations, showcasing high accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a lightweight and optimal validation protocol for analog quantum simulators, capable of detecting major hardware faults while achieving high accuracy, efficiency, and robustness against SPAM and depolarizing errors.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators can directly emulate time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics, enabling the exploration of diverse physical phenomena such as phase transitions, quench dynamics, and non-equilibrium processes. Realizing accurate analog simulations requires high-fidelity time-dependent pulse control, yet existing calibration schemes are tailored to digital gate characterization and cannot be readily extended to learn continuous pulse trajectories. We present a characterization algorithm for in situ learning of pulse trajectories by extending the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) framework to analyze time-dependent pulses. By combining QSP with a logical-level analog-digital mapping paradigm, our method reconstructs a smooth pulse directly from queries of the time-ordered propagator, without requiring mid-circuit measurements or additional evolution. Unlike conventional Trotterization-based methods, our approach avoids unscalable performance degradation arising from accumulated local truncation errors as the logical-level segmentation increases. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy with strong efficiency and robustness against SPAM as well as depolarizing errors, providing a lightweight and optimal validation protocol for analog quantum simulators capable of detecting major hardware faults.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that coupled kinetic-inductance resonators provide a robust and scalable platform for broadband, high-power, and magnetically resilient quantum-limited amplification, addressing limitations of Josephson-junction-based amplifiers.

Abstract: Parametric amplification is essential for quantum measurement, enabling the amplification of weak microwave signals with minimal added noise. While Josephson-junction-based amplifiers have become standard in superconducting quantum circuits, their magnetic sensitivity, limited saturation power, and sub-kelvin operating requirements motivate the development of alternative nonlinear platforms. Here we demonstrate a two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier based on a pair of capacitively coupled Kerr-nonlinear resonators fabricated from NbTiN and NbN thin films. The distributed Kerr nonlinearity of these materials enables nondegenerate four-wave-mixing amplification with gains approaching 40 dB, gain-bandwidth products up to 6.9 MHz, and 1-dB compression powers two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art Josephson amplifiers. A coupled-mode theoretical model accurately captures the pump-induced modification of the hybridized modes and quantitatively reproduces the observed signal and idler responses. The NbN device exhibits a significantly larger Kerr coefficient and superior gain-bandwidth performance, highlighting the advantages of high-kinetic-inductance materials. Our results establish coupled kinetic-inductance resonators as a robust platform for broadband, high-power, and magnetically resilient quantum-limited amplification, offering a scalable route for advanced readout in superconducting qubits, spin ensembles, quantum dots, and other microwave-quantum technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an overview and evaluation of free probability theory's application in calculating the density of states for quantum systems and random matrix Hamiltonians, addressing both its successes and limitations.

Method: The method involves using free additive convolution to approximate the density of states of a Hamiltonian from its non-commuting component operators, assuming mutual freeness. A perturbation scheme based on subordination formulas for the Cauchy transform is also described.

Result: The approach yields reasonably accurate approximations for the density of states in various models, with examples from the literature. The perturbation scheme further refines these approximations in specific cases like the Rosenzweig-Porter ensemble and the Anderson model.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the effectiveness and limitations of free probability theory in approximating the density of states for quantum systems and random matrix Hamiltonians, and introduces a perturbation scheme for improved accuracy in certain models.

Abstract: We provide a brief overview of approaches for calculating the density of states of quantum systems and random matrix Hamiltonians using the tools of free probability theory. For a given Hamiltonian of a quantum system or a generic random matrix Hamiltonian, which can be written as a sum of two non-commutating operators, one can obtain an expression for the density of states of the Hamiltonian from the known density of states of the two component operators by assuming that these operators are mutually free and by using the free additive convolution. In many examples of interacting quantum systems and random matrix models, this procedure is known to provide a reasonably accurate approximation to the exact numerical density of states. We review some of the examples that are known in the literature where this procedure works very well, and also discuss some of the limitations of this method in situations where the free probability approximation fails to provide a sufficiently accurate description of the exact density of states. Subsequently, we describe a perturbation scheme that can be developed from the subordination formulas for the Cauchy transform of the density of states and use it to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the density of states in various models, such as the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble and the Anderson model with on-site disorder.

Motivation: To extend the topological classification of insulators and superconductors (the 'ten-fold way') to bosonic systems, despite fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons.

Method: Theoretical framework for free boson topology protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, including squeezing transformations and bosonic time reversal. Experimental validation via photo-magnonic crystals and finite-element modelling.

Result: Identification of two topologically non-trivial symmetry classes in one dimension, including models like the bosonic Kitaev chain and bosonic SSH model. Experimental signatures of boundary modes in photo-magnonic crystals are demonstrated.

Conclusion: The study proposes a robust experimental platform, photo-magnonic crystals, for testing the theory of bosonic topological phases, with clear experimental signatures of boundary modes. The results provide a blueprint for future experimental realizations and observations of exotic physics in bosonic systems.

Abstract: The topological classification of insulators and superconductors, the "ten-fold way", is grounded on fermionic many-body symmetries and has had a dramatic impact on many fields of physics. Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a potentially optimal way forward: a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They consist of arrays of interconnected photo-magnonic cavities. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed. Our modelling of the photo-magnonic chain provides a thorough blueprint for its experimental realisation and the unambiguous observation of its exotic physics.

Abstract: For a subclass of a general $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric Hamiltonian obeying anti-commutation relation with its conjugate, a Hermitian basis is found that spans the bi-orthonormal energy eigenvectors. Using the modified projectors constructed from these eigenvectors, the generalized density matrix of the $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric evolution is calculated, and subsequently, ergotropy for a closed system is obtained. The $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric system, in an open system scenario, is studied to understand ergotropy under different regimes of non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian. The consistency of the three laws of thermodynamics for the $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric system in an open system scenario is also analyzed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a more efficient and accurate quantum state tomography method for matrix product states (MPS) using the classical shadow protocol.

Method: The procedure leverages the classical shadow protocol to estimate tensor components of the tensor train ansatz derived from the MPS assumption, achieving convergence with quadratic sample complexity.

Result: Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy of the density matrix approximation and demonstrate superior performance in observable estimation tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Sketch Tomography provides an efficient and accurate method for quantum state tomography, especially for MPS states, outperforming classical shadow protocol and maximum likelihood estimation in certain scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Sketch Tomography, an efficient procedure for quantum state tomography based on the classical shadow protocol used for quantum observable estimations. The procedure applies to the case where the ground truth quantum state is a matrix product state (MPS). The density matrix of the ground truth state admits a tensor train ansatz as a result of the MPS assumption, and we estimate the tensor components of the ansatz through a series of observable estimations, thus outputting an approximation of the density matrix. The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state. For observable estimation tasks involving moderately large subsystems, we show that our procedure gives rise to a more accurate estimation than the classical shadow protocol. We also show that sketch tomography is more accurate in observable estimation than quantum states trained from the maximum likelihood estimation formulation.

TL;DR: Full 3D simulations of SiMOS charge shuttling revealed challenges like defect-induced orbital excitation, but identified robust operating regimes with increased confinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of progress in high-fidelity electron shuttling demonstrations in SiMOS systems compared to Si/SiGe systems, by exploring potential pitfalls and optimizing operational conditions.

Method: The researchers performed full 3D simulations of conveyor-belt charge shuttling in a realistic SiMOS device by solving the Poisson and time-dependent Schrodinger equations. They analyzed effects of oxide-interface roughness, gate fabrication imperfections, and charge defects.

Result: The simulations showed that conveyor-belt shuttling collapses to bucket-brigade mode under low clavier-gate voltages due to oxide screening. Increased confinement restored conveyor-belt operation, which was robust against most defects except those at the Si/SiO2-interface. Defects in the transport channel could capture electrons under lower biases.

Conclusion: The study identifies key challenges and viable operating regimes for reliable charge transport in SiMOS architectures, highlighting the impact of defects and the importance of confinement to maintain conveyor-belt operation.

Abstract: Extensive theoretical and experimental work has established high-fidelity electron shuttling in Si/SiGe systems, whereas demonstrations in Si/SiO2 (SiMOS) remain at an early stage. To help address this, we perform full 3D simulations of conveyor-belt charge shuttling in a realistic SiMOS device, building on earlier 2D modelling. We solve the Poisson and time-dependent Schrodinger equations for varying shuttling speeds and gate voltages, focusing on potential pitfalls of typical SiMOS devices such as oxide-interface roughness, gate fabrication imperfections, and charge defects along the transport path. The simulations reveal that for low clavier-gate voltages, the additional oxide screening in multi-layer gate architectures causes conveyor-belt shuttling to collapse to the bucket-brigade mode, inducing considerable orbital excitation in the process. Increasing the confinement restores conveyor-belt operation, which we find to be robust against interface roughness, gate misalignment, and charge defects buried in the oxide. However, our results indicate that defects located at the Si/SiO2-interface can induce considerable orbital excitation. For lower conveyor gate biases, positive defects in the transport channel can even capture passing electrons. Hence we identify key challenges and find operating regimes for reliable charge transport in SiMOS architectures.

Motivation: To explore and control atomic dynamics precisely through non-trivial dispersion relations in photonic waveguides, specifically leveraging long-range hoppings in coupled-resonator systems.

Method: The research involves engineering the jth-order nearest neighbor (JNN) hoppings between resonators to create linear dispersion relations with chiral characteristics. The propagation fidelities of Gaussian wave packets are analyzed to quantify dispersion linearity.

Result: The designed waveguides enable directional atomic radiation and absorption, and the framework supports achieving generalized dispersion relations beyond linear, such as quadratic and cubic.

Conclusion: This study presents a unified framework for simulating atom-environment couplings with engineered dispersion relations, including linear, quadratic, and cubic forms, via specifically designed long-range hoppings in coupled-resonator waveguides.

Abstract: Non-trivial dispersion relations engineered in photonic waveguide for the precise control of atomic dynamics has recently attracted considerable attention. Here, we study a system in which atoms are coupled to one-dimensional coupled-resonator waveguides with long-range hoppings. By carefully engineering the jth-order nearest neighbor (JNN) hoppings between resonators, we construct linear dispersion relations with the chiral characteristic. To quantify the degree of linearity, we analyze the propagation fidelities of Gaussian wave packets in these waveguides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such coupled-resonator waveguides can serve as versatile platforms for enabling directional atomic radiation and absorption. Beyond linear dispersion relations, more general forms, including quadratic and cubic relations, can also be achieved through tailored JNN-hoppings. Our study thus provides a unified framework for simulating atom-environment couplings with arbitrary dispersion relations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical encrypted control schemes, which are vulnerable to single key-bit errors and lack efficiency, by leveraging quantum communication for enhanced security and robustness.

Method: A computationally efficient encrypted control framework using quantum communication is proposed. It employs a quantum channel for key generation enhanced by quantum key distribution, a novel encryption-decryption architecture for linear systems, and quantization techniques for practical scenarios.

Result: The proposed framework guarantees stability if intrinsic quantum noise is below a critical threshold, shows strong robustness to key imperfections, and successfully implements privacy protection for quantum keys using a stochastic quantizer.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that integrating quantum technologies into control systems can significantly enhance performance by reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors, while ensuring robust security against eavesdropping.

Abstract: Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing analyses that rely on weak coupling Lindblad limits, which result in slow mixing and require vanishing coupling strengths for accuracy.

Method: The research introduces new techniques for controlling all orders of the Dyson expansion and analyzes multidimensional operator Fourier transforms to rigorously prove the efficiency of system bath interaction models.

Result: The results show that accurate state preparation is possible even with constant cumulative coupling strength, improving upon prior theoretical bounds and validated by numerical simulations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that accurate quantum state preparation is achievable beyond the weak coupling Lindblad limit, with numerical simulations confirming robustness across weak and strong coupling regimes.

Abstract: We establish new theoretical results demonstrating the efficiency and robustness of system bath interaction models for quantum thermal and ground state preparation. Unlike existing analyses, which relies on the weak coupling Lindblad limit and require $O(ε)$ coupling strengths for $ε$ accuracy, leading to slow mixing, we rigorously show that accurate state preparation remains possible far beyond this regime. In particular, even when the cumulative coupling strength remains constant rather than vanishing, the induced quantum channel still approximately fixes the target state. Our proof introduces new techniques for controlling all orders of the Dyson expansion and for analyzing the associated multidimensional operator Fourier transforms. These bounds substantially improve upon prior results, and numerical simulations on the TFIM and Hubbard models further confirm the robustness of the system bath interaction framework across both weak and strong coupling regimes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and analyze phase-space nonclassicality and Wigner negativity, particularly in the context of avoided crossings in quantum systems like the oval billiard.

Method: A complex-entropy framework is developed for Wigner negativity, including a sign-resolved decomposition for analyzing negative weight and phase-space distribution, and defining a negative-channel Fisher information.

Result: The framework successfully measures phase-space nonclassicality through the imaginary part of the Gibbs-Shannon functional and identifies enhanced negativity and amplified Fisher response during avoided crossings, indicating mode hybridization.

Conclusion: The construction of this framework is generic and can be applied to other wave-chaotic and mesoscopic systems with phase-space representations, as demonstrated in the oval billiard system.

Abstract: We develop a complex-entropy framework for Wigner negativity and apply it to avoided crossings in an oval quantum billiard. For a real Wigner function the Gibbs--Shannon functional becomes complex; its imaginary part, proportional to the Wigner-negative volume, serves as an entropy-like measure of phase-space nonclassicality. A sign-resolved decomposition separates the total negative weight from its phase-space distribution and defines a negative-channel Fisher information that quantifies how sensitively the negative lobe reshapes as a control parameter is varied. This structure yields a Cauchy--Schwarz bound that limits how rapidly the imaginary entropy, and hence the Wigner negativity, can change with the parameter. In the oval billiard, avoided crossings display enhanced negativity and an amplified negative-channel Fisher response, providing a clear phase-space signature of mode hybridization. The construction is generic and extends to other wave-chaotic and mesoscopic systems with phase-space representations.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a quantum hashing algorithm that generates high-entropy fingerprints from message-induced graphs, distinguishing even co-spectral but non-isomorphic graphs, and providing a foundation for post-quantum hashing.

Method: The method involves mapping input messages to weighted graphs via a discrete random walk on a toroidal grid, using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) to extract the phase spectrum of the graph Laplacian, and converting the spectral fingerprint into a 256-bit digest.

Result: The results show that QGH-256 produces a compact 256-bit digest with strong sensitivity to input perturbations and effectively distinguishes non-isomorphic graphs. The implementation on a 4 X 4 grid is empirically validated to balance collision avoidance and execution time.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that QGH-256 is a feasible quantum spectral hashing algorithm that generates high-entropy fingerprints with strong sensitivity to input perturbations, providing a structurally rich foundation for post-quantum hashing. The implementation on a 4 X 4 toroidal grid demonstrates its practical viability.

Abstract: We present Quantum Graph Hash (QGH-256), a novel quantum spectral hashing algorithm that generates high-entropy fingerprints from message-induced graphs. Each input message is mapped to a weighted graph via a discrete random walk on an n X n toroidal grid, where the walk dynamics determine the edge weights. Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is then used to extract the phase spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Unlike standard QPE settings, the phase estimation is performed with respect to a superposition state (a uniform superposition over all node basis states) rather than an eigenvector, ensuring that all eigencomponents contribute to the resulting spectrum. This yields spectral features that distinguish even co-spectral but non-isomorphic message-induced graphs. The final spectral fingerprint is converted into a 256-bit digest, producing a compact representation of the input. As the fingerprint encodes both spectral and dynamical properties of the message-induced graph, the resulting hash exhibits strong sensitivity to input perturbations and provides a structurally rich foundation for post-quantum hashing. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we implement QGH-256 on a 4 X 4 toroidal grid, chosen empirically: smaller grids exhibit collisions, whereas larger grids significantly increase execution time. The entire pipeline is implemented in Qiskit, and we use a seeded statevector simulator to obtain stable, noise-free results.

Abstract: The performance of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes, an approach to hardware-efficient quantum error correction, is limited by the finite squeezing capabilities of current experimental platforms. To circumvent this hardware demand, we introduce Energy-Scaled Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ES-ZNE), a quantum error mitigation protocol that uses the mean photon number of the GKP code as a tunable effective noise parameter. The protocol measures logical observables at a series of accessible finite energies and extrapolates the results to the ideal, infinite-energy limit using an ansatz based on the code's asymptotic error scaling. Through simulating a GKP qubit under a pure-loss channel, we demonstrate that ES-ZNE successfully mitigates finite-energy errors, recovering the ideal expectation values (within numerical uncertainty) in the shallow-noise regime. Furthermore, by computationally removing artifacts arising from the finite-energy encoding, our method characterizes the intrinsic performance of the ideal GKP code, revealing a sharp error threshold beyond which the code's corrective power diminishes. These results establish ES-ZNE as a practical, software-based strategy for enhancing the performance of near-term bosonic quantum processors, trading sampling overhead for demanding physical resources like high squeezing.

Abstract: Quantum communication protocols seek to leverage the unique properties of quantum systems for coordination or communication tasks, usually with guarantees of security or anonymity that exceed what is possible classically. One promising domain of application is elections, where strong such guarantees are essential to ensure legitimacy. We experimentally implement a recently proposed election protocol from Centrone et al. such that no one, including a potential central authority, can know the preferred candidate of any voter other than themself. We conduct a four-party election, generating and distributing four-partite GHZ states with $\approx 89\%$ fidelity and successfully recording voters' intentions $\approx 87\%$ of the time.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a clear and efficient connection between two BQP-complete problems (quantum walks and harmonic oscillators) and enable direct translation of algorithms between these paradigms.

Method: The authors develop a transparent mapping between continuous time quantum walks and harmonic oscillator systems, ensuring compatibility with initialization, read-out, and oracle access while maintaining low overhead.

Result: A transparent mapping between quantum walks and harmonic oscillators that preserves problem structure, geometry, and efficiency, enabling algorithmic translation and alternative proofs of BQP-completeness.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a direct and transparent mapping between continuous time quantum walks and harmonic oscillator systems, showing that this mapping preserves problem structure, geometry, and efficiency, and provides a novel way to prove BQP-completeness.

Abstract: Continuous time quantum walks on exponentially large, sparse graphs form a powerful paradigm for quantum computing: On the one hand, they can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. On the other hand, they are themselves BQP-complete, providing an alternative framework for thinking about quantum computing -- a perspective which has indeed led to a number of novel algorithms and oracle problems. Recently, simulating the dynamics of a system of harmonic oscillators (that is, masses and springs) was set forth as another BQP-complete problem defined on exponentially large, sparse graphs. In this work, we establish a direct and transparent mapping between these two classes of problems. As compared to linking the two classes of problems via their BQP-completeness, our mapping has several desirable features: It is transparent, in that it respects the structure of the problem, including the geometry of the underlying graph, initialization, read-out, and efficient oracle access, resulting in low overhead in terms of both space and time; it allows to map also between restricted subsets of instances of both problems which are not BQP-complete; it provides a recipe to directly translate any quantum algorithm designed in the quantum walk paradigm to harmonic oscillators (and vice versa); and finally, it provides an alternative, transparent way to prove BQP-completeness of the harmonic oscillator problem by mapping it to BQP-completeness construction for the quantum walk problem (or vice versa).

Motivation: The motivation is to move beyond the reliance on entangled pairs and distributed two-qubit gates by proposing efficient schemes for multipartite entanglement in a single shot, aiming to simplify the implementation of global gates in distributed quantum computing.

Method: The paper explores the use of multipartite entanglement resources (e.g., GHZ states) for distributed fan-out operations and qudits of dimension four for circuit compression, specifically targeting global gates with pairwise qubit interactions.

Result: The research demonstrates the utility of multipartite entanglement and qudits in implementing challenging circuits (global gates), potentially reducing circuit depth and improving efficiency in distributed quantum computation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with implications for future work on quantum circuit compilation and quantum data centre design, highlighting the potential of multipartite entanglement and qudits for distributed quantum computing.

Abstract: Much recent work on distributed quantum computing have focused on the use of entangled pairs and distributed two qubit gates. But there has also been work on efficient schemes for achieving multipartite entanglement between nodes in a single shot, removing the need to generate multipartite entangled states using many entangled pairs. This paper looks at how multipartite entanglement resources (e.g., GHZ states) can be useful for distributed fan-out operations; we also consider the use of qudits of dimension four for distributed quantum circuit compression. In particular, we consider how such fan-out operations and qudits can be used to implement circuits which are challenging for distributed quantum computation, involving pairwise qubit interactions, i.e., what has been called global gates (a.k.a. global Mølmer-Sørensen gates). Such gates have been explored to possibly yield more efficient computations via reduced circuit depth, and can be carried out efficiently in some types of quantum hardware (e.g., trapped-ion quantum computers); we consider this as an exploration of an ``extreme'' case for distribution given the global qubit-qubit interactions. We also conclude with some implications for future work on quantum circuit compilation and quantum data centre design.

Abstract: Optomechanical cooling of levitated nanoparticles has become an essential topic in modern quantum physics, providing a platform for exploring macroscopic quantum phenomena and high-precision sensing. However, conventional cavity-assisted cooling is fundamentally constrained by cavity dissipation and environmental noise, limiting the attainable minimum temperature. In this work, we propose a non-Hermitian optomechanical cooling scheme through nonreciprocal coupling between two levitated nanoparticles, where one particle is directly cooled by an optical cavity and the other is cooled indirectly through a non-Hermitian interaction. Both analytical solutions and numerical simulations reveal that increasing nonreciprocity enhances directional energy transfer, enabling the target particle to reach a lower phonon occupation than is achievable in conventional cavity cooling. This study demonstrates a new cooling mechanism driven by non-Hermitian interactions, offering theoretical guidance for realizing controllable energy flow and deep cooling in levitated optomechanical systems, and paving the way for future developments in quantum control and sensing technologies.

Motivation: The paper aims to understand the influence of quantum fluctuations on phase-space vorticity and quantify equilibrium and stability properties of Hamiltonian non-linear dynamics.

Method: The research employs phase-space differential geometrical structures within the Weyl-Wigner framework to derive quantifiers of stationarity, classicality, purity, and vorticity, and relates these to Hamiltonian dynamics.

Result: Analytical expressions for equilibrium-stability parameters are obtained, and the relationship between Wigner flow properties and hyperbolic stability boundaries is demonstrated.

Conclusion: The study establishes a clear link between Wigner flow properties and hyperbolic stability boundaries in phase-space, providing explicit analytical expressions for equilibrium-stability parameters in quantum Gaussian ensembles.

Abstract: Quantifiers of stationarity, classicality, purity and vorticity are derived from phase-space differential geometrical structures within the Weyl-Wigner framework, after which they are related to the hyperbolic stability of classical and quantum-modified Hamiltonian (non-linear) equations of motion. By examining the equilibrium regime produced by such an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations, a correspondence between Wigner flow properties and hyperbolic stability boundaries in the phase-space is identified. Explicit analytical expressions for equilibrium-stability parameters are obtained for quantum Gaussian ensembles, wherein information quantifiers driven by Wigner currents are identified. Illustrated by an application to a Harper-like system, the results provide a self-contained analysis for identifying the influence of quantum fluctuations associated to the emergence of phase-space vorticity in order to quantify equilibrium and stability properties of Hamiltonian non-linear dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The fundamental metrological limits of temperature sensing in open quantum systems, especially the role of non-Gaussian quantum resources, remain unresolved.

Method: Analytic bounds on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature estimation are derived using non-Gaussian states undergoing dissipative bosonic evolution, with a focus on the short-time regime governed by a time-local master equation. Exact numerical simulations are performed to substantiate theoretical insights.

Abstract: The fundamental metrological limits of temperature sensing in open quantum systems remain largely unresolved, particularly regarding the role of non-Gaussian quantum resources. In this letter, we establish analytic bounds on the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature estimation using non-Gaussian states undergoing dissipative bosonic evolution. By focusing on the short-time regime governed by a time-local master equation, we derive precise scaling laws that elucidate when and how non-Gaussian probes decisively outperform Gaussian states under identical energy constraints. Our analysis uncovers a distinct linear-in-time QFI enhancement unique to Fock states, in contrast to the inherently weaker, quadratic scaling of Gaussian probes. These theoretical insights are substantiated through exact numerical simulations and mapped onto experimentally accessible platforms such as circuit QED. Our results not only clarify the quantum thermometric advantage of non-Gaussianity but also chart a realistic pathway toward harnessing it in noisy quantum technologies.

Motivation: Quantitatively imaging spatially varying magnetic fields with full vector information over extended areas remains a major challenge, and existing probes have limitations in resolution, speed, or sensitivity.

Method: The authors adapted a commercial widefield microscope to implement a camera-compatible pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance protocol, resolving the Zeeman shifts of the four NV orientations to reconstruct stray-field vectors from microscale devices.

Result: The implementation achieves a spatial resolution of ≈0.52 μm across an 83 μm × 83 μm field of view, a peak sensitivity of (828 ± 142) nT Hz⁻¹, and acquisition times of only a few minutes.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates pulsed widefield NV magnetometry on standard microscopes as a practical and scalable tool for routine vector-resolved imaging of complex magnetic devices.

Abstract: Many spintronic, magnetic-memory, and neuromorphic devices rely on spatially varying magnetic fields. Quantitatively imaging these fields with full vector information over extended areas remains a major challenge. Existing probes either offer nanoscale resolution at the cost of slow scanning, or widefield imaging with limited vector sensitivity or material constraints. Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to bridge this gap, but a practical camera-based vector magnetometry implementation on relevant microstructures has not been demonstrated. Here we adapt a commercial widefield microscope to implement a camera-compatible pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance protocol to reconstruct stray-field vectors from microscale devices. By resolving the Zeeman shifts of the four NV orientations, we reconstruct the stray-field vector generated by microfabricated permalloy structures that host multiple stable remanent states. Our implementation achieves a spatial resolution of $\approx 0.52 ~μ\mathrm{m}$ across an $83~μ\mathrm{m} \times 83~μ\mathrm{m}$ field of view and a peak sensitivity of $ (828 \pm 142)~\mathrm{nT\,Hz^{-1}}$, with acquisition times of only a few minutes. These results establish pulsed widefield NV magnetometry on standard microscopes as a practical and scalable tool for routine vector-resolved imaging of complex magnetic devices.

TL;DR: This paper identifies bottlenecks in existing quantum algorithms for CFD and proposes a novel algorithm for the incompressible lattice Boltzmann equation, finding a modest quantum advantage for certain observables but highlighting the need for further development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to determine whether quantum computers can accelerate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, given the growing interest in quantum computing for scientific applications. The authors aim to address the limitations of existing quantum algorithms and explore potential quantum advantages.

Method: The authors first analyze the limitations of existing quantum algorithms for CFD, identifying bottlenecks such as lack of convergence, prohibitive time-stepping requirements, unfavorable condition number scaling, and inefficient data extraction. They then develop a novel algorithm for the incompressible lattice Boltzmann equation to circumvent these issues, providing a detailed analysis of algorithmic complexity and gate count estimates.

Result: The results indicate a modest quantum advantage for selected observables in high-error-tolerance regimes, with specific bounds on Reynolds number scaling for their algorithm. However, numerical investigations suggest a lower speedup than theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The study concludes that while modest quantum advantages may be preserved for certain observables in high-error-tolerance regimes, the overall speedup is lower than initially expected. The findings highlight the potential for nontrivial quantum advantages in CFD but emphasize the need for further rigorous development of quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a cornerstone of classical scientific computing, and there is growing interest in whether quantum computers can accelerate such simulations. To date, the existing proposals for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for CFD have almost exclusively been based on the Carleman embedding method, used to encode nonlinearities on a quantum computer. In this work, we begin by showing that these proposals suffer from a range of severe bottlenecks that negate conjectured quantum advantages: lack of convergence of the Carleman method, prohibitive time-stepping requirements, unfavorable condition number scaling, and inefficient data extraction. With these roadblocks clearly identified, we develop a novel algorithm for the incompressible lattice Boltzmann equation that circumvents these obstacles, and then provide a detailed analysis of our algorithm, including all potential sources of algorithmic complexity, as well as gate count estimates. We find that for an end-to-end problem, a modest quantum advantage may be preserved for selected observables in the high-error-tolerance regime. We lower bound the Reynolds number scaling of our quantum algorithm in dimension $D$ at Kolmogorov microscale resolution with $O(\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{3}{4}(1+\frac{D}{2})} \times q_M)$, where $q_M$ is a multiplicative overhead for data extraction with $q_M = O(\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{3}{8}})$ for the drag force. This upper bounds the scaling improvement over classical algorithms by $O(\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{3D}{8}})$. However, our numerical investigations suggest a lower speedup, with a scaling estimate of $O(\mathrm{Re}^{1.936} \times q_M)$ for $D=2$. Our results give robust evidence that small, but nontrivial, quantum advantages can be achieved in the context of CFD, and motivate the need for additional rigorous end-to-end quantum algorithm development.

Abstract: Cubic phase states provide the essential non-Gaussian resource for continuous-variable quantum computing. We show that they also offer significant potential for quantum metrology, surpassing the phase-sensing sensitivity of all Gaussian states at equal average photon number. Optimal sensitivity requires only moderate initial squeezing, and the non-Gaussian advantage remains robust against loss and detection noise. We identify optimal measurement strategies and show that several experimentally relevant preparation schemes surpass Gaussian limits, in some cases reaching the sensitivity of cubic phase states. Our results establish cubic phase states as a promising resource for quantum-enhanced precision measurements beyond Gaussian limits.

TL;DR: Quantum algorithms for Largest Empty Square and Rectangle problems achieve quadratic speed-up in query complexity over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore quantum solutions for geometric search problems, particularly focusing on optimizing query complexity for finding the largest empty regions in 2D and 1D maps, and to compare these solutions with classical bounds.

Method: The authors propose quantum algorithms for solving the Largest Empty Square problem and the Largest Empty Rectangle problem with fixed width. The algorithms utilize quantum computing principles to reduce query complexity.

Result: The quantum algorithm achieves query complexities of ~O(n^1.5) for the Largest Empty Square and ~O(n√d) for the Largest Empty Rectangle with fixed width d, significantly improving upon the classical lower bounds of Ω(n^2) and Ω(nd), respectively. For the 1D version, the quantum algorithm achieves O(√n log n log log n) query complexity, nearly matching the Ω(√n) lower bound.

Conclusion: The paper presents quantum algorithms that achieve significant speed-ups over classical bounds for the Largest Empty Square and Largest Empty Rectangle problems, demonstrating quadratic speed-up in query complexity.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider the problem of searching for the Largest empty rectangle in a 2D map, and the one-dimensional version of the problem is the problem of searching for the largest empty segment. We present a quantum algorithm for the Largest Empty Square problem and the Largest Empty Rectangle of a fixed width $d$ for $n\times n$-rectangular map. Query complexity of the algorithm is $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ for the square case, and $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{d})$ for the rectangle with a fixed width $d$ case, respectively. At the same time, the lower bounds for the classical case are $Ω(n^2)$, and $Ω(nd)$, respectively. The Quantum algorithm for the one-dimensional version of the problem has $O(\sqrt{n}\log n\log\log n)$ query complexity. The quantum lower bound for the problem is $Ω(\sqrt{n})$ which is almost equal to the upper bound up to a log factor. The classical lower bound is $Ω(n)$. So, we obtain the quadratic speed-up for the problem.

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical scheme using HHL and VQLS for solving EFIE in CEM shows promise for large-scale problems by reducing computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical solvers face memory limitations for large electromagnetic problems, while existing quantum algorithms for SIEs-based methods are limited in solvable matrix sizes.

Method: A hybrid quantum-classical scheme is proposed, involving a preconditioned linear system and a double-layer iterative strategy (external iteration for subspace matrix systems and internal iteration using quantum algorithms like HHL and VQLS).

Result: The hybrid VQLS-classical scheme shows lower computational complexity than conventional fast solvers, as confirmed by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The hybrid quantum-classical scheme, particularly the hybrid VQLS-classical approach, demonstrates lower computational complexity compared to conventional fast solvers, making it more promising for large-scale electromagnetic problem analysis.

Abstract: Conventional classical solvers are commonly used for solving matrix equation systems resulting from the discretization of SIEs in computational electromagnetics (CEM). However, the memory requirement would become a bottleneck for classical computing as the electromagentic problems become much larger. As an alternative, quantum computing has a natural "parallelization" advantage with much lower storage complexity due to the superposition and entanglement in quantum mechanics. Even though several quantum algorithms have been applied for the SIEs-based methods in the literature, the size of the matrix equation systems solvable using them is still limited. In this work, we use a hybrid quantum-classical scheme to solve the EFIE for analyzing electromagentic scattering from three-dimensional (3D) perfect electrically conducting objects with arbitrary shapes in CEM for the first time. Instead of directly solving the original EFIE matrix equation system using the quantum algorithms, the hybrid scheme first designs the preconditioned linear system and then uses a double-layer iterative strategy for its solution, where the external iteration layer builds subspace matrix equation systems with smaller dimension and the internal iteration layer solves the smaller systems using the quantum algorithms. Two representative quantum algorithms, HHL and VQLS, are considered in this work, which are executed on the quantum simulator and quantum computer platforms. We present the theoretical time complexity analysis of the hybrid quantum-classical scheme and perform numerical experiments to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid scheme. The results show that the computational complexity of the hybrid VQLS-classical scheme is lower than the conventional fast solvers in classical computing, which indicates the hybrid scheme is more promising for analyzing large-scale electromagnetic problems.

Motivation: Addressing the vulnerability of classical voting schemes to information leakage by leveraging quantum properties for enhanced security and privacy.

Method: Experimental demonstration using a high-performance source of GHZ states, with two scenarios: a four-voter, two-candidate setup and an eight-voter, sixteen-candidate setup.

Result: Successful proof-of-principle implementation of the protocol, highlighting its feasibility for secure board-level or small governmental elections.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a quantum-based electronic voting protocol that ensures information-theoretic security and efficiency, suitable for small-scale elections.

Abstract: Quantum information protocols offer significant advantages in properties such as security, anonymity, and privacy for communication and computing tasks. An application where guaranteeing the highest possible security and privacy is critical for democratic societies is electronic voting. As computational power continues to evolve, classical voting schemes may become increasingly vulnerable to information leakage. In this work, we present the experimental demonstration of an information-theoretically secure and efficient electronic voting protocol that, crucially, does not rely on election authorities, leveraging the unique properties of quantum states. Our experiment is based on a high-performance source of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and realizes a proof-of-principle implementation of the protocol in two scenarios: a configuration with four voters and two candidates employing privacy enhancement techniques and an election scenario supporting up to eight voters and sixteen candidates. The latter is particularly well-suited for secure board-level elections within organizations or small-scale governmental contexts.

Motivation: To address the computational challenges of the chance constrained unit commitment problem (UCP) due to uncertainty from renewable generation and fluctuating demand, leveraging quantum computing as a potential solution.

Method: The problem is reformulated as a mixed integer linear program and solved using a DWave hybrid quantum-classical solver alongside Gurobi, with QUBO reformulations also tested.

Result: The hybrid solver performed competitively under strict runtime limits for large scenario sets (15,000), while Gurobi remained superior for smaller cases. Current quantum annealers cannot accommodate stochastic UCPs due to hardware limits.

Conclusion: The study evaluates the applicability of quantum annealing platforms to the chance constrained UCP, finding that hybrid quantum-classical methods are competitive for large scenario sets but current quantum annealers remain fundamentally limited due to hardware constraints.

Abstract: Uncertainty is fundamental in modern power systems, where renewable generation and fluctuating demand make stochastic optimization indispensable. The chance constrained unit commitment problem (UCP) captures this uncertainty but rapidly becomes computationally challenging as the number of scenarios grows. Quantum computing has been proposed as a potential route to overcome such scaling barriers. In this work, we evaluate the applicability of quantum annealing platforms to the chance constrained UCP. Focusing on a scenario approximation, we reformulated the problem as a mixed integer linear program and solved it using DWave hybrid quantum classical solver alongside Gurobi. The hybrid solver proved competitive under strict runtime limits for large scenario sets (15,000 in our experiments), while Gurobi remained superior on smaller cases. QUBO reformulations were also tested, but current annealers cannot accommodate stochastic UCPs due to hardware limits, and deterministic cases suffered from embedding overhead. Our study delineates where chance constrained UCPs can already be addressed with hybrid quantum classical methods, and where current quantum annealers remain fundamentally limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of quantum measurement by directly coupling a quantum system to a classical measurement register, avoiding the traditional von Neumann chain of infinite couplings.

Method: Formulates quantum measurement using a modified framework of frames, coupling a qubit (represented as a positive probability distribution over classical bits) to a classical measurement bit. The interaction is modeled by a quasi-bistochastic process.

Result: The interaction produces a collapsed state with the correct quantum-mechanical probability for the measurement outcome, leveraging quasi-bistochastic processes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully captures the nonclassical nature of quantum measurement while treating the measurement register classically, bypassing the von Neumann chain of infinite couplings.

Abstract: We propose a formulation of quantum measurement within a modified framework of frames, in which a quantum system - a single qubit - is directly coupled to a classical measurement bit. The qubit is represented as a positive probability distribution over two classical bits, a and a', denoted by p(aa'). The measurement apparatus is described by a classical bit $α= \pm 1$, initialized in the pure distribution $p(α) = \frac{1}{2}(1 + α)$. The measurement interaction is modeled by a quasi-bistochastic process $ S(bb'β\mid aa'α)$ - a bistochastic map that may include negative transition probabilities, while acting on an entirely positive state space. When this process acts on the joint initial state $p(aa')p(α)$, it produces a collapsed state $p(bb'\midβ)$, yielding the measurement outcome $β$ with the correct quantum-mechanical probability $p(β)$. This approach bypasses the von Neumann chain of infinite couplings by treating the measurement register classically, while capturing the nonclassical nature of measurement through the quasi-bistochastic structure of the interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of describing quantum states in high-dimensional phase space during nonlinear interactions, the paper aims to simplify the calculation of input-output relations for relevant modes.

Method: The paper introduces the generalized Bloch-Messiah decomposition (GBMD) to reduce the complexity of describing quantum states before and after nonlinear interactions, and demonstrates its application by analyzing input states like Fock states and two-mode squeezed vacuum.

Result: The GBMD enables efficient calculation of multimode Wigner functions for output states, and the convolution process with Gaussian phase-space functions is demonstrated for specific input states, highlighting the impact on output Wigner functions and von Neumann entropy.

Conclusion: The presented framework provides an efficient method to analyze and optimize the amplification or frequency conversion of broadband quantum states, facilitating the generation and characterization of ultrafast optical quantum states.

Abstract: The theoretical description of broadband, multimode quantum pulses undergoing a second-order $χ^{(2)}$-nonlinear interaction can be quite intricate, due to the large dimensionality of the underlying phase space. However, in many cases only a few broadband (temporal) modes are relevant before and after the nonlinear interaction. Here we present an efficient framework to calculate the relation between the quantum states at the input and output of a nonlinear element in their respective relevant modes. Since the number of relevant input and output modes may differ, resulting in an open quantum system, we introduce the generalized Bloch-Messiah decomposition (GBMD), reducing the description to an equal number of input and output modes. The GBMD enables us to calculate the multimode Wigner function of the output state by convolving the rescaled Wigner function of the reduced input quantum pulse with a multivariate Gaussian phase-space function. We expand on this result by considering two examples input states: A Fock state in a single broadband mode and a two-mode squeezed vacuum, both in the THz-frequency regime, up-converted to a single output broadband mode of optical frequencies. We investigate the effect, the convolution and thermalization due to entanglement breakage have on the output Wigner function by calculating the von Neumann entropy of the output Wigner function. The methods presented here can be used to optimize the amplification or frequency conversion of broadband quantum states, opening an avenue to the generation and characterization of optical quantum states on ultrafast time scales.

Abstract: We develop an image theory for the recently proposed single-bounce quantum gravimeter. Free fall and quantum bounce of a matter wave-packet are described through decompositions over a basis of continuous energies.

Abstract: The accurate and efficient detection of quantum entanglement remains a central challenge in quantum information science. In this work, we study the detection of entanglement of polarized photons for measurement devices that are solely specified by rotational symmetry. We derive explicit positive operator valued measures (POVMs) showing that from a quantum information perspective any such setting is classified by one real measurable parameter r. In Particular, we give a POVM formulation of the Klein--Nishina formula for Compton scattering of polarized photons. We provide an SDP-based entanglement certification method that operates on the full measured statistics and gives tight bounds, also considering semi-device independent scenarios. Furthermore, we show that, while Bell violations are impossible with rotationally covariant measurements, EPR steering can still be certified under one-sided symmetry constraints. Finally, we present a rotationally covariant showcase experiment, analyzing the scattering of polarized optical light in a selection of soft drinks. Our results suggest that lemonade-based detectors are suitable for entanglement detection.

*Sebastián de-la-Peña,Heiko Appel,Angel Rubio,Ofer Neufeld*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a full quantum theory for entanglement in HHG, aligning with experiments and revealing oscillatory entanglement behavior dependent on laser power, while emphasizing the role of focal averaging in entanglement measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is an open debate regarding the theory level required for correctly describing the quantum aspects of HHG emission, such as squeezing or entanglement. Previous approaches have missed out key entanglement features by using non-interacting classical ensembles of trajectories or perturbation theory based on classical trajectories.

Method: We develop a full quantum theory for entanglement measures in HHG solving exactly the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian and employ it for evaluating the entanglement between emitted photons of different harmonics.

Result: Our theory achieves qualitative agreement with experiments, showing that the R entanglement parameter decreases with increasing laser power for below-threshold harmonics. We predict that fine-tuning laser power can enhance HHG entanglement features, which oscillate with driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. The oscillatory behavior is also predicted for above-threshold harmonics, and focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom is found to play a key role in entanglement measures.

Conclusion: Our work establishes the state-of-the art in exploring entanglement features in HHG, and paves way for analysis and engineering of 'truly-quantum' multi-photon states in the XUV and ultrafast regime for more complex matter systems.

Abstract: Quantum high-harmonic generation (HHG) is a growing field of research with capabilities of providing high photon-number entangled states of light. However, there is an open debate regarding the theory level required for correctly describing the quantum aspects of HHG emission, such as squeezing or entanglement. Previous approaches have employed non-interacting classical ensembles of trajectories, or perturbation theory utilizing the classical trajectories as a starting point, missing out key entanglement features. In this Letter, we develop a full quantum theory for entanglement measures in HHG solving exactly the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian and employ it for evaluating the entanglement between emitted photons of different harmonics. For the first time, we reach qualitative agreement of theory with recent experiments showing that the R entanglement parameter decreases with increasing laser power for below-threshold harmonics. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the laser power could enhance HHG entanglement features, which are observed to oscillate with the driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. Similarly, our theory predicts that the oscillatory behavior of entanglement observed for below-threshold harmonics also appears for entanglement involving above-threshold harmonics. We also show that the long-range behavior of driven electronic trajectories can qualitatively change the resulting entanglement. Lastly, we show that focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom, which has thus far been ignored in quantum HHG theories, plays a key role in entanglement measures and can change the qualitative behavior of observables. Our work establishes the state-of-the art in exploring entanglement features in HHG, and paves way for analysis and engineering of 'truly-quantum' multi-photon states in the XUV and ultrafast regime for more complex matter systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: TARA framework provides statistically valid quantum anomaly detection, revealing methodological flaws in traditional quantum certification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum key distribution (QKD) security certification methods lack rigorous statistical guarantees under finite-sample conditions and adversarial scenarios.

Method: Combining conformal prediction with sequential martingale testing via the TARA framework, which includes TARA-k (Kolmogorov-Smirnov calibration) and TARA-m (betting martingales for streaming detection).

Result: TARA achieves robust quantum-classical discrimination (ROC AUC = 0.96) and demonstrates cross-platform robustness on IBM Torino and IonQ Forte Enterprise quantum processors, with a 36% security margin above the classical CHSH bound.

Conclusion: The study reveals a methodological concern in quantum certification, highlighting that same-distribution calibration can inflate detection performance, potentially leading to overestimation of adversarial robustness in prior studies.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) security fundamentally relies on the ability to distinguish genuine quantum correlations from classical eavesdropper simulations, yet existing certification methods lack rigorous statistical guarantees under finite-sample conditions and adversarial scenarios. We introduce TARA (Test by Adaptive Ranks), a novel framework combining conformal prediction with sequential martingale testing for quantum anomaly detection that provides distribution-free validity guarantees. TARA offers two complementary approaches. TARA k, based on Kolmogorov Smirnov calibration against local hidden variable (LHV) null distributions, achieving ROC AUC = 0.96 for quantum-classical discrimination. And TARA-m, employing betting martingales for streaming detection with anytime valid type I error control that enables real time monitoring of quantum channels. We establish theoretical guarantees proving that under (context conditional) exchangeability, conformal p-values remain uniformly distributed even for strongly contextual quantum data, confirming that quantum contextuality does not break conformal prediction validity a result with implications beyond quantum certification to any application of distribution-free methods to nonclassical data. Extensive validation on both IBM Torino (superconducting, CHSH = 2.725) and IonQ Forte Enterprise (trapped ion, CHSH = 2.716) quantum processors demonstrates cross-platform robustness, achieving 36% security margins above the classical CHSH bound of 2. Critically, our framework reveals a methodological concern affecting quantum certification more broadly: same-distribution calibration can inflate detection performance by up to 44 percentage points compared to proper cross-distribution calibration, suggesting that prior quantum certification studies using standard train test splits may have systematically overestimated adversarial robustness.

Motivation: 提出一种无需宏观浴即可将量子谐振子从基态热化的有限时间协议。

Method: 利用第二个振荡器作为有效环境，并通过突然改变振荡器频率和耦合来实现热化。由于动态的高斯性质，热化条件简化为三个可解的方程。

Result: 该协议能够为密集离散温度集提供精确的解析解，并为其他情况提供数值解。任何目标温度都可以以任意精度逼近，速度和准确性之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 该协议因其简单性和有效性，成为量子热力学实验中快速、受控热化的有前途工具。

Abstract: We introduce a finite-time protocol that thermalizes a quantum harmonic oscillator, initially in its ground state, without requiring a macroscopic bath. The method uses a second oscillator as an effective environment and implements sudden quenches of the oscillator frequencies and coupling. Owing to the Gaussian nature of the dynamics, the thermalization condition reduces to three solvable equations, yielding exact analytic solutions for a dense discrete set of temperatures and numerical solutions in all other cases. Any target temperature can be approximated with arbitrary precision, with a trade-off between speed and accuracy. The simplicity of the protocol makes it a promising tool for rapid, controlled thermalization in quantum thermodynamics experiments and state preparation.

TL;DR: The paper confirms non-classical quantum correlations in a previously unresolved six-node causal structure, completing the classification for structures of up to six nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the open question of whether quantum correlations that cannot be reproduced classically exist in the only remaining causal structure with six or fewer nodes, thereby completing the classification of such structures.

Method: The method involves imposing additional restrictions on correlations to demonstrate the existence of quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically.

Result: Quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically are shown to exist in the studied causal structure.

Conclusion: The study confirms the existence of quantum correlations in the specified causal structure, completing the understanding of non-classical quantum correlations in structures with up to six nodes.

Abstract: The discovery of Bell that there exist quantum correlations that cannot be reproduced classically is one of the most important in the foundations of quantum mechanics, as well as having practical implications. Bell's result was originally proven in a simple bipartite causal structure, but analogous results have also been shown in further causal structures. Here we study the only causal structure with six or fewer nodes in which the question of whether or not there exist quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically was open. In this causal structure we show that such quantum correlations exist using a method that involves imposing additional restrictions on the correlations. This hence completes the picture of which causal structures of up to six nodes support non-classical quantum correlations. We also provide further illustrations of our method using other causal structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how disorder and its interplay with particle interactions affect the bias-reversal symmetry in nonequilibrium transport systems.

Method: The research employs analytical and numerical analyses to investigate the effects of bond and site disorder on bias-reversal symmetry.

Result: Bias-reversal symmetry holds if the local left-right bond-bias ratio is spatially uniform; bond disorder preserves the symmetry beyond linear response, while site disorder breaks it due to heterogeneity and particle interactions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that environmental disorder and interparticle interactions collaborate to create asymmetric transport, offering a unified theoretical framework for understanding transport in biological and artificial nanochannels.

Abstract: The bias-reversal symmetry -- where reversing an external bias inverts the current without changing its magnitude -- is a hallmark of nonequilibrium transport. While this property holds in homogeneous systems such as the asymmetric simple exclusion process, how disorder and its interplay with particle interactions affect this symmetry has remained unclear. Here, we establish a general criterion showing that the bias-reversal symmetry holds if and only if the local left-right bond-bias ratio is spatially uniform. Analytical and numerical analyses reveal that bond disorder preserves the symmetry beyond linear response, whereas site disorder breaks it through an interplay between heterogeneity and particle interactions. Our results demonstrate how environmental disorder and interparticle interactions cooperate to generate asymmetric transport, thereby providing a unified theoretical framework relevant to transport through biological and artificial nanochannels.

Motivation: To investigate phase transitions and critical phenomena through the analysis of dimensionless quantities defined as ratios of partition functions.

Method: Numerical calculations using the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group for the Ising model, three-state Potts model, and four-state Potts model.

Result: The critical values of partition-function ratios agree well with the universal values predicted by CFT, with logarithmic corrections observed in the four-state Potts model.

Conclusion: The partition-function ratios exhibit universal behavior at criticality, aligning with CFT predictions, and show logarithmic corrections in the four-state Potts model.

Abstract: The behavior of dimensionless quantities defined as ratios of partition functions is analyzed to investigate phase transitions and critical phenomena. At criticality, the universal values of these ratios can be predicted from conformal field theory (CFT) through the modular-invariant partition functions on a torus. We perform numerical calculations using the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group for three two-dimensional models belonging to different universality classes: the Ising model, the three-state Potts model, and the four-state Potts model. The partition-function ratios obey the same finite-size scaling form as the Binder parameter, and their critical values agree well with the universal values predicted by CFT. In the four-state Potts model, we observe logarithmic corrections in the system-size dependence of these ratios.

TL;DR: The paper applies the Carleman approach to stochastic differential equations, analyzing moment dynamics via block-structured matrices for various noise-driven models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the deterministic Carleman approach to stochastic systems and simplify spectral decomposition for moment dynamics.

Method: The Carleman approach is applied to stochastic differential equations with polynomial forces and diffusion-matrix elements, focusing on moment dynamics.

Result: The Carleman matrix's block structure aids in spectral analysis, with examples showing diagonal or triangular forms for specific stochastic processes.

Conclusion: The Carleman approach successfully transforms stochastic differential equations into an infinite-dimensional linear system for moments, with applications in analyzing various noise-driven models.

Abstract: The Carleman approach is well-known in the field of deterministic classical dynamics as a method to replace a finite number $d$ of non-linear differential equations by an infinite-dimensional linear system. Here this approach is applied to a system of $d$ stochastic differential equations for $[x_1(t),..,x_d(t)]$ when the forces and the diffusion-matrix elements are polynomials, in order to write the linear system governing the dynamics of the averaged values ${\mathbb E} ( x_1^{n_1}(t) x_2^{n_2}(t) ... x_d^{n_d}(t) )$ labelled by the $d$ integers $(n_1,..,n_d)$. The natural decomposition of the Carleman matrix into blocks associated to the global degree $n=n_1+n_2+..+n_d$ is useful to identify the models that have the simplest spectral decompositions in the bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors. This analysis is then applied to models with a single noise per coordinate, that can be either additive or multiplicative or square-root, or with two types of noises per coordinate, with many examples in dimensions $d=1,2$. In $d=1$, the Carleman matrix governing the dynamics of the moments ${\mathbb E} ( x^{n}(t) )$ is diagonal for the Geometric Brownian motion, while it is lower-triangular for the family of Pearson diffusions containing the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and the Square-Root processes, as well as the Kesten, the Fisher-Snedecor and the Student processes that converge towards steady states with power-law-tails. In dimension $d=2$, the Carleman matrix governing the dynamics of the correlations ${\mathbb E} ( x_1^{n_1}(t) x_2^{n_2}(t) )$ has a natural decomposition into blocks associated to the global degree $n=n_1+n_2$, and we discuss the simplest models where the Carleman matrix is either block-diagonal or block-lower-triangular or block-upper-triangular.

Motivation: Identifying clear experimental signatures of fractionalized fermionic excitations in QSLs is challenging because these excitations are charge-neutral and do not couple to conventional electromagnetic probes.

Method: The researchers used the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice to analyze the strain responses of different QSL phases, including semimetallic Kitaev spin liquid and gapped chiral spin liquid.

Result: Distinct QSL phases exhibit different strain responses: semimetallic and gapped chiral spin liquids show Landau quantization and diamagnetic-like responses, while the Majorana metal phase shows a paramagnetic-like response without Landau levels.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that lattice strain is an effective tool to probe and distinguish different QSL phases, with distinct responses in semimetallic and gapped chiral spin liquids. Local resonant ultrasound spectroscopy is proposed as a practical method to detect these strain-induced signatures.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host emergent, fractionalized fermionic excitations that are charge-neutral. Identifying clear experimental signatures of these excitations remains a central challenge in the field of strongly correlated systems, as they do not couple to conventional electromagnetic probes. Here, we propose lattice strain as a powerful and tunable probe: Mechanical deformation of the lattice generates large pseudomagnetic fields, inducing pseudo-Landau levels that serve as distinctive spectroscopic signatures of these excitations. Using the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice, we show that distinct QSL phases exhibit strikingly different strain responses. The semimetallic Kitaev spin liquid and the gapped chiral spin liquid display pronounced Landau quantization and a diamagnetic-like response to strain, whereas the Majorana metal phase shows a paramagnetic-like response without forming Landau levels. These contrasting behaviors provide a direct route to experimentally identifying and distinguishing QSL phases hosting fractionalized excitations. We further outline how local resonant ultrasound spectroscopy can detect the strain-induced resonances associated with these responses, offering a practical pathway towards identifying fractionalized excitations in candidate materials.

Conclusion: The study identifies small-to-large Fermi-surface fluctuations as the primary driver of strange-metal behavior and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law at the quantum critical point in YbRh2Si2.

Abstract: Results of combined thermal and electrical transport measurements through the magnetic field-induced quantum critical point in the heavy-fermion compound YbRh2Si2 are revisited to explore the relationship between the strange-metal behavior, observed in both the electrical and electronic thermal resistivity, and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the zero-temperature limit. A new type of inelastic scattering center for the charge and heat carriers has been detected and ascribed to the small-to-large Fermi-surface fluctuations. These are operating in the vicinity of and at the Kondo-destroying quantum critical point as fermionic quantum critical fluctuations and are considered the primary driver of the strange-metal behavior and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law.

Abstract: Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking.
  We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation.
  We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sign-resolved analysis to diagnose bias in Quantum Monte Carlo simulations caused by the fermion sign problem, showing why certain observables are especially sensitive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of quantum simulations caused by the fermion sign problem, which leads to negative configuration weights and compromises statistical sampling, often resulting in qualitatively incorrect results.

Method: The paper employs auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo calculations to analyze histograms of key quantities (kinetic energy, antiferromagnetic structure factor, and pair susceptibilities) for configurations with positive and negative weights (S=±1). The study derives an exact relation linking bias to the difference between sign-resolved means and the average sign.

Result: The analysis reveals that ignoring the sign of weights leads to bias in measurements, particularly for observables like the d-wave pairing susceptibility. The exact relation derived provides a diagnostic tool for understanding this bias.

Conclusion: The study provides a precise diagnostic of the origin of measurement bias in Quantum Monte Carlo simulations by analyzing the statistics of observables in a sign-resolved manner. It explains why certain observables, like the d-wave susceptibility, are particularly sensitive to the sign problem.

Abstract: Quantum simulations are a powerful tool for exploring strongly correlated many-body phenomena. Yet, their reach is limited by the fermion sign problem, which causes configuration weights to become negative, compromising statistical sampling. In auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the doped Hubbard model, neglecting the sign ${\cal S}$ of the weight leads to qualitatively wrong results -- most notably, an apparent suppression rather than enhancement of $d$-wave pairing at low temperature. Here we approach the problem from a different perspective: instead of identifying negative-weight paths, we examine the statistics of measured observables in a sign-resolved manner. By analyzing histograms of key quantities (kinetic energy, antiferromagnetic structure factor, and pair susceptibilities) for configurations with ${\cal S}=\pm1$, we derive an exact relation linking the bias from ignoring the sign to the difference between sign-resolved means, $Δμ$, and the average sign, $\langle {\cal S}\rangle$. Our framework provides a precise diagnostic of the origin of measurement bias in Quantum Monte Carlo and clarifies why observables such as the $d$-wave susceptibility are especially sensitive to the sign problem.
