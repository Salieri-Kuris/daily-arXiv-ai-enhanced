Accurate modeling of these phenomena requires precise ab initio data for high-energy decay channels, specifically photoabsorption and photoelectron emission. These are computationally difficult for classical methods due to prohibitive scaling in simulating electron dynamics, or due to the inability to resolve the ionization continuum in an efficient manner. In this work, we present quantum simulation algorithms to compute these key observables. First, we introduce a coherent time-domain spectroscopy algorithm optimized to resolve the photoabsorption cross-section at the 92 eV operating frequency. Second, we develop a first-quantized plane-wave simulation to compute the photoelectron kinetic energy spectrum, utilizing real-time dynamics and energy windowing to treat bound and delocalized scattering states on equal footing. Additionally, we provide logical resource estimation for a model photoresist monomer, 4-iodo-2-methylphenol (IMePh), and demonstrate that 92 eV absorption sensitivity can be resolved using roughly $200$ logical qubits and $10^{9}$ total non-Clifford gates per circuit with approximately $10^3$ shots for the smallest instance. The more sophisticated photoemission algorithm that models the continuum explicitly, incurs gate costs of $\\geq 10^{13}$ total non-Clifford gates per circuit, $10^4$ shots, and requires a few thousand logical qubits.

However, the lack of a rigorous threshold theorem has left open whether the UF decoder can achieve fault tolerance beyond the error models and parameter regimes tested in numerical simulations. Here, we provide a rigorous proof of a finite threshold for the UF decoder on the surface code under the circuit-level local stochastic error model. To this end, we develop a refined error-clustering framework that extends techniques previously used to analyze cellular-automaton and renormalization-group decoders, by showing that error clusters can be separated by substantially larger buffers, thereby enabling analytical control over the behavior of the UF decoder. Using this guarantee, we further prove a quasi-polylogarithmic upper bound on the average runtime of a parallel UF decoder in terms of the code size. We also show that this framework yields a finite threshold for the greedy decoder, a simpler decoder with lower complexity but weaker empirical error suppression.

The strong parity symmetry of the model leads to degenerate stationary states. This symmetry is further broken into non-stationary states in the thermodynamic limit, which exhibit persistent oscillations. As the driving force increases, the Liouvillian spectrum of these states features a phase transition.

In addition to global loss that affects both bosonic modes identically, we further add global dephasing and show that the oscillating qubit is preserved. Finally, in order to gain additional physical insight, we study the effect of phase perturbation to both modes and observe that likewise they are passively protected, returning approximately to their initial configurations.

In FeSe, symmetry-breaking perturbations serve as highly sensitive probes of these couplings. Previous work has shown that defects and isoelectronic substitution can substantially alter these interactions, giving rise to additional phonon modes. In this study, uniaxial strain is employed as a tunable symmetry-breaking control parameter to probe the intrinsic lattice response in the absence of disorder. The temperature evolution of phonon excitations was examined with fine temperature resolution in the vicinity of the nemato-structural transition temperature $T_s$, under strain applied along the $\\langle 110 \\rangle$ and $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ crystallographic directions. A subtle asymmetry of the $A_{1g}^{ph}$ mode appears in the unstrained crystal within a narrow temperature window around $T_s$, originating from the emergence of an additional mode in the fully symmetric channel. With applied strain, this feature becomes more distinctly resolved. The anomaly is attributed to modifications of the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom driven by the ordering fluctuations right above the nematic transition. These fluctuations enhance susceptibility for phonon-electron-phonon coupling in the vicinity of the X and R points of the Brillouin zone and promote two-phonon scattering close to the $A_{1g}^{ph}$ mode.

Unlike conventional approaches such as electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR), this mechanism exploits dot-to-dot variations of the spin precession axes to enable spin rotations. However, it is intrinsically disorder-dependent: in the absence of sufficient variability, the precession axes remain aligned and spin manipulation becomes ineffective. This fundamental reliance on disorder raises concerns regarding its compatibility with the long-term evolution of spin-qubit platforms toward improved material quality, cleaner interfaces, and enhanced device reproducibility. Here, we numerically assess the viability of spin manipulation by hopping as a function of disorder strength and demonstrate that its implementation is indeed increasingly constrained as disorder is reduced. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative strategy based on hopping between intentionally squeezed quantum dots.

They interact indirectly through the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism, which limits the use of isolated impurity spins in applications such as qubits and spintronics. Suppressing the RKKY interaction would therefore enable access to the host's unperturbed behavior while simultaneously isolating impurity spins for functional use. Although single-color laser driving can suppress the RKKY interaction, it typically requires strong fields that may be impractical or destabilizing. To overcome these limitations, we show that two-color laser driving provides efficient and tunable control over all components of the RKKY interaction using two weak laser fields. Focusing on two-dimensional Rashba altermagnets, we show that interference between one- and two-photon processes produces altermagnet-specific Floquet corrections. These include additional AC Stark shifts, magnetizations, spin-orbit renormalization, and emergent in-plane Zeeman fields that are absent under single-color driving and in non-altermagnetic systems. Notably, two-color driving induces a finite $z$-component of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, stabilizing in-plane chiral magnetism and related textures in Rashba altermagnets. These effects enable tunable, near-complete on-off switching of the Heisenberg, Ising, and DM interactions through a Lifshitz-like modulation of the Fermi surface.

We define a worst-case notion of compatibility where nodes are prevented from coordinating after task arrival and illustrate why tasks may be incompatible. Furthermore, we explore compatibility extensions that account for stochastic arrivals and the capability to supplement the pre-shared entanglement with additional entanglement on-demand, and show that incompatibility differs structurally dependent on the set of concurrent tasks.

In this work, we propose a variant of these algorithms, leveraging both classical and quantum resources. Provided the classical knowledge (the entries) of the matrix/vector of interest, a classical procedure is used to pre-process this information. Then they are fed into a quantum circuit which is shown to be a block encoding of the matrix of interest.

Metodi"], "title": "Correcting coherent quantum errors by going with the flow", "comment": "11 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "The performance of a given quantum error correction (QEC) code depends upon the noise model that is assumed. Independent Pauli noise, applied after each quantum operation, is a simplistic noise model that is easy to simulate and understand in the context of stabilizer codes. Although such a noise model is artificial, it is equivalent to independent, random, unbiased qubit rotations. What about spatially or temporally correlated qubit rotations? Such a noise model is applicable to global operations (e.g., NMR or ESR), common control sources (e.g., lasers), or slow drift (e.g., charge or magnetic noise) in various qubit technologies. In the worst case, such errors can combine constructively and result in a post-correction failure rate that increases with the number of error correction cycles. However, we show that this worst case does not generally arise unless taking active corrective actions while performing QEC. That is, by employing virtual Pauli frame updates (\"passive\" error correction) rather than physical corrections (\"active\" error correction), coherent errors do not compound appreciably. Starting in a random Pauli frame is also advantageous. In fact, through perturbation theory arguments and supporting numerical simulations, we show that the logical qubit performance beyond distance 3 for correlated single-qubit Hamiltonian noise models (i.e., global errant qubit rotations), when employing these \"lazy\" strategies, essentially matches the performance of Pauli noise model with the same process fidelity (fidelity after one application). In a more general circuit model of noise, correlations may add constructively within syndrome extraction rounds but Pauli frame randomization from passive error correction mitigates this effect across multiple rounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this problem, a usual strategy is to map the assembly to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation, which can be solved by different quantum algorithms. In this work, we focus on three versions of the Feedback-based Algorithm, a protocol that eliminates classical optimization loops via measurement feedback. We analyze long-read DNA fragments from SARS-CoV-2 and human mitochondrial DNA using standard FALQON, second-order FALQON (SO-FALQON), and time-rescaled FALQON (TR-FALQON). Numerical results show that both variants improve convergence to the ground state and increase success probabilities at reduced circuit depths. These findings indicate that enhanced feedback-driven dynamics are effective for solving combinatorial problems on near-term quantum hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the discrete hydrodynamic view, this fluid is not fundamental but emerges from many underlying microscopic fluid components whose collective behavior reproduces quantum phenomena. The most developed realization of this idea is the discrete many interacting worlds (MIW) framework, in which discrete particle-like worlds interact via inter-world forces and quantum probabilities are grounded in direct world counting. But there is also an older, continuous version of MIW. After reviewing the hydrodynamic and MIW formalisms, and emphasizing some of their interpretational advantages over the Everettian Many Worlds and Bohmian approaches, we argue that all discrete hydrodynamic models face a generic structural difficulty, which we call the problem of sparse ontology. Because wavefunctions typically branch under decoherence, the discrete components of the fluid are repeatedly partitioned into sub-ensembles, thereby thinning their density in configuration space and driving the dynamics away from the quantum regime once the components become sufficiently sparse. We conclude that successful hydrodynamic completions of quantum mechanics plausibly require an essentially continuous ontology.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, BP may encounter convergence issues and suboptimal performance, especially for short-length codes and in high-noise channels. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a type of Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems by minimizing a problem-specific cost function. In this paper, we present a QAOA-based decoding framework for LDPC codes by formulating a decoding cost function that incorporates both parity-check constraints and soft channel reliability information. The resulting optimization problem is solved using QAOA to search for low-energy configurations corresponding to valid codewords. We test the proposed method through extensive numerical experiments and compare its performance with BP decoding. The experimental results demonstrate that the QAOA-based decoder achieves a higher probability of correctly recovering the transmitted codeword than BP across multiple experimental settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
