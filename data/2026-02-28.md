Abstract: We theoretically study surface superconductivity in a nodal-line semimetal by combining a minimal tight-binding model with a layer-resolved Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach. In the normal state, the model realizes a bulk nodal loop and an associated drumhead surface band in a slab geometry with open boundaries in the $z$ direction: the central layers reproduce the bulk-like density of states, whereas the surface layer exhibits a sharp zero-energy peak originating from the drumhead states. On top of this band structure we introduce chiral $p$-wave and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting channels and determine the layer-dependent gap amplitudes self-consistently. The chiral $p$-wave order parameter is strongly enhanced at the outermost layers and decays within only a few layers towards the interior, while the $d$-wave order parameter is more than an order of magnitude smaller on all layers. The quasiparticle dispersion and surface local density of states in the chiral $p$-wave state show that the drumhead band is efficiently gapped out and that the zero-energy peak in the normal surface spectrum is split into two coherence peaks, directly reflecting the induced superconducting gap. These results demonstrate that superconductivity driven by drumhead surface states is naturally biased toward a surface-localized chiral $p$-wave pairing symmetry and may offer qualitative guidance for interpreting surface-sensitive experiments on Pd-doped CaAgP.

Abstract: Misfit layered compounds are natural van der Waals heterostructures in which electronically active transition-metal dichalcogenide layers are decoupled by incommensurate blocking layers, enabling bulk realization of quasi-two-dimensional quantum states. Here we investigate the superconducting, transport,and structural properties of the misfit compound $\mathrm{(SnS)_{1.15}(TaS_2)}$ under pressures up to 150 GPa. The low-pressure superconducting phase is gradually suppressed and disappears near 14.7 GPa,accompanied by increasing residual resistance. Remarkably, a distinct superconducting phase reemerges above 80 GPa and persists to the highest pressures achieved. This reentrant superconductivity follows a pressure-induced sign reversal of the Hall coefficient near 60 GPa and a nonmonotonic evolution of the normal-state resistance, indicating an electronic reconstruction. No structural phase transition is detected over the entire pressure range. Our results demonstrate a pressure-driven electronic reconstruction leading to reentrant superconductivity in a misfit layered compound, establishing pressure as an effective route to engineer superconductivity and electronic states in natural van der Waals heterostructures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: For a relatively long time, the observation of the DC diamagnetic state in highly compressed nickelate superconductors [1],[2] has been a challenging experimental problem. And recently Li et al.[3] reported on the measurements of the DC diamagnetism in zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) pressurized single crystal $La_2SmNi_2O_7$. From the analysis of experimental data, Li et al.[3] reported that the superconducting phase fraction in their $La_2SmNi_2O_7$ sample measured in the ZFC mode is 62.1%, and the superconducting phase fraction in the FC mode is 14.4%. It should be clarified that we regard the measurements of the DC diamagnetic state [3] in $La_2SmNi_2O_7$ (and more recently in $Pr_4Ni_3O_{10}$ [4]) as outstanding experimental results confirming bulk superconductivity in pressurized nickelates. However, we should note that Li et al.[3] made a threefold error in their calculations of the superconducting phase fraction in $La_2SmNi_2O_7$. We believe that correcting this and other errors in Ref.[3] will benefit the physics community.

Abstract: Electronic and thermoelectric transport in zigzag monolayer WSe$_2$ nanoribbons are studied under monochromatic irradiation. The electronic structure is described within a six-orbital tight-binding framework constructed from the relevant tungsten and selenium orbitals, with atomic spin-orbit coupling included explicitly. Periodic driving is incorporated via the Peierls substitution, and in the high-frequency limit the system is mapped onto an effective static Floquet Hamiltonian with polarization-dependent renormalized hoppings. Coherent transport is evaluated using wave-function matching within the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. The lattice thermal conductivity is obtained independently from density functional perturbation theory combined with an iterative solution of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Light-induced hopping renormalization reshapes the band dispersion and transmission spectrum near the Fermi level, modifying the Landauer transport integrals that determine electrical and thermal conductances and the Seebeck coefficient. Together with spin-orbit-driven band splitting and reduced lattice thermal conductivity from enhanced anharmonic scattering, this leads to a thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$ exceeding unity over a broad temperature range.

Abstract: We study the impact of off-resonant tunneling and coherences on the electron pumping through quantum dots. Thereby, we focus on two electron-pump setups where lowest-order tunneling processes are suppressed and the pump is exclusively driven by modulations of the coupling energy. The first setup is driven by switching on and off the couplings between the quantum dot and the leads, while the second setup employs measurements of the dot occupation. We derive exact solutions for arbitrarily strong tunnel couplings in the absence of Coulomb interaction, identify parameter regimes with optimal pumping currents or optimal energy efficiency, and discuss similarities between both pumping mechanisms.

Abstract: The Peierls instability, the spontaneous dimerization of a one-dimensional metallic chain at half filling, is a paradigmatic mechanism for charge-density-wave (CDW) formation. Here we test its robustness under finite doping and interchain hybridization in finite-thickness arrays of identical chains. We find that the stacking geometry plays a decisive role in stabilizing CDW order away from half filling. In particular, parallel-coupled chains exhibit a bistable regime where the normal and dimerized states coexist as local minima of the total energy, while skew-coupled chains display reentrant CDW order upon doping. Our results demonstrate that even minimal models of coupled atomic chains host rich phase diagrams controlled by doping, lattice rigidity, and interchain coupling geometry.

Abstract: Altermagnets exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting despite having zero net magnetization. This enables a spin-splitter effect in which an external electric field generates transverse spin currents by separating oppositely polarized carriers. Here, we develop a unified semiclassical theory of linear extrinsic spin-splitter currents, incorporating impurity-induced side-jump and skew-scattering contributions, and apply it to the $d$-wave altermagnet \ch{FeSb2}. We demonstrate that asymmetric impurity scattering provides a dominant channel for spin-splitter currents. Remarkably, the resulting extrinsic spin conductivity is time-reversal even, in contrast to previously studied spin-splitter responses arising from symmetric scattering.

Abstract: Developing intrinsic homojunctions without chemical heterogeneity remains a key challenge in future two - dimensional devices. Here, we report a geometry - defined metal--semiconductor--metal homojunction in bilayer blue phosphorus (BlueP) created by a localized bubble corrugation, without chemical doping or foreign - material interfaces. First - principles calculations show that enlarging the interlayer separation in the metallic A\(_1\)B\(_1\) - stacked BlueP bilayer opens a band gap, enabling a semiconducting barrier embedded between metallic segments. First - principles quantum - transport simulations reveal a crossover from ballistic to tunneling transport upon bubble formation. In the tunneling regime, transmission decreases exponentially with bubble width while remaining weakly sensitive to bubble height and bulging direction. The junction acts as an orientation - dependent \(k\) - space filter, producing transport anisotropy and momentum selectivity. Orbital - resolved scattering analysis shows that intralayer - bonding channels persist under deformation whereas interlayer - hybridized channels are quenched, and that σ- type bonding yields higher conductance than π- type bonding. These insights motivate two electromechanical device concepts: a mechanically switchable memory element with ON/OFF ratios up to 30 and a nanoscale sliding rheostat with reproducible exponential resistance tuning for Å- scale displacement sensing.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fluctuations are intrinsic to microscopic systems and impose fundamental limits on nonequilibrium precision, as captured by the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), which links current fluctuations to entropy production. While feedback control is expected to further suppress fluctuations, its role within the TUR framework has remained unclear, particularly in quantum systems where control is inherently information-driven. In this Letter, we consider open quantum systems weakly coupled to a thermal environment, in which quantum jumps are continuously monitored, and Markovian feedback is applied. Using quantum mutual information to quantify the information contribution induced by feedback, we derive a finite-time TUR for arbitrary time-integrated currents in terms of entropy production and mutual information. Our results uncover how feedback control suppresses fluctuations together with thermodynamic cost and establishes a fundamental precision bound imposed by information-based control. As an application, we analyze a quantum clock model and demonstrate that the clock precision can be enhanced by feedback control in the presence of a single thermal reservoir.

Abstract: The notion of operator growth in quantum systems furnishes a bridge between transport and the generation of entanglement between different parts of the system under quantum dynamics. We define a measure of operator growth in terms of subsystem operator Rényi entropy, which provides a state-independent measure of operator growth, unlike entanglement entropies, and the usual measures of operator growth like out-of-time-order correlators. We show that the subsystem operator Rényi entropy encodes both spatial and temporal information, and thus can directly connect to transport for a local operator related to a conserved quantity. We construct a unified Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory formalism for the time evolution of operator Rényi entropy and entanglement entropies of initial pure states. We use the SK field theory to obtain the operator Rényi and state entanglement entropies in terms of infinite-temperature and vacuum Keldysh Green's functions, respectively, for non-interacting systems. We apply the method to explore the connection between operator and entanglement growth, and transport in non-interacting systems with quasiperiodic and random disorder, like the one- and two-dimensional Aubry-André models and the two-dimensional Anderson model. In particular, we show that the growth of subsystem operator Rényi entropy and state von Neumann and Rényi entanglement entropies can capture both ballistic and sub-ballistic transport behaviors, like diffusive and anomalous diffusive transport, as well as localization in these systems.

Abstract: Absolutely stabilizer states are those that remain convex mixtures of stabilizer states after conjugation by any unitary. Here we give a characterization of such states for multiple qudits of all prime dimensions by introducing a polytope of their allowed spectra. We illustrate this through the examples of one qubit, two qubits, and one qutrit. In particular, the set of absolutely stabilizer states for a single qubit is a ball inscribed in the stabilizer octahedron, but for higher dimensions the geometry is more complicated. For odd-prime-dimensional qudits, we also give a complete characterization of absolutely Wigner-positive states, i.e., states whose Wigner function remains nonnegative after conjugation by any unitary. In so doing, we show there are absolutely Wigner-positive states that are not absolutely stabilizer, which can be seen as a unitarily-invariant version of bound magic. We then study the radii of the largest balls contained in the sets of absolutely stabilizer states and absolutely Wigner-positive states. These radii respectively tell us the lowest possible purity of nonstabilizer and Wigner-negative states. Conversely, we also find the radius of the smallest ball containing the set of absolutely Wigner-positive states, giving a tight purity-based necessary condition thereof.

Abstract: We numerically investigate quantum circuit elementary-gate level instantiations of the standard Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm for the task of computing the ground-state energy of a quantum magnet; the disordered fully-connected quantum Heisenberg spin glass model. We consider (classical simulations of) QPE circuit computations on relatively small quantum Hamiltonians ($3$ qubits) with up to $10$ phase bits of precision, using up to Trotter order $10$. We systematically study the inputs of QPE, specifically time evolution, Trotter order, Trotter steps, and initial state, and illustrate how these inputs practically determine how QPE operates. From this we outline a coherent set of quantum algorithm input and tuning guidelines. One of the notable properties we characterize is that QPE sampling of the optimal digitized phase converges to a fixed rate. This results in strong diminishing returns of optimal phase sampling rates which can occur when the Trotter error is surprisingly high.

Abstract: We present a first-principles derivation of a non-equilibrium quantum master equation for a continuously driven open quantum system interacting with a structured electromagnetic environment. Starting from a driven Caldeira-Leggett model in which an external classical field couples simultaneously to the system and reservoir degrees of freedom, we proceed without assuming that the standard equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem holds. The bath statistics acquire explicit dependence on the two-time autocorrelation function of the applied field, leading to drive-biased noise correlations and intrinsically non-Markovian dynamics. By eliminating the reservoir exactly at the operator level, we obtain a driven quantum generalized Langevin equation whose noise and dissipation kernels depend on two independent times. Exploiting the Gaussian nature of the driven bath, we derive a modified Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation in which the diffusion coefficients and coherent forces inherit explicit memory of the external field. We demonstrate that the physically observable oscillation frequency remains encoded in the homogeneous Green's function of the Langevin equation, while the drive-induced corrections manifest exclusively through modified diffusion and drift terms. Our results provide a unified microscopic framework for understanding field-biased fluctuation relations with direct relevance to cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments operating far from equilibrium.

Abstract: A protocol for identifying controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates versus single-qubit-only gates in universal quantum circuits using randomized input states was recently shown to be intimately connected to the quantum resource of state texture. Here we revisit this gate identification protocol and demonstrate that a more general fidelity-based formulation succeeds for nearly all laboratory bases. We then examine a broader family of quantum resource theories, where a distinct resource theory can be defined for each choice of reference pure state, establishing core resource-theoretic requirements without the computational shortcut offered by the "grand sum" employed in the original formulation of state texture. By extending from single "resourceless" states to convex sets via a convex-roof construction, we recover single-qubit measures of known resource theories such as imaginarity and coherence. Finally, we introduce a family of "fixed-point resource theories" that includes fixed-point instances of the theories of state texture, genuine coherence, purity, and athermality. For these fixed-point resource theories we show that, under free operations, the fidelity-based lower bound is weakly monotonic, while specific violations of strong monotonicity are found for the convex-roof logarithmic measure.

Abstract: In arXiv:2503.00188 we introduced broadband pulsed (BBP) homodyne measurements as a generalization of standard pulsed homodyne quadrature measurements. BBP can take advantage of detectors such as calorimeters that have the potential for high efficiency over a broad spectral range. BBP homodyne retains the advantages of standard pulsed homodyne, enabling measurement of arbitrary quadratures in the limit of large amplitude local oscillators (LO). Here we quantify the convergence of standard and BBP homodyne quadrature measurements to those of the quadrature of interest. We obtain lower bounds on the fidelity of the post-measurement classical-quantum state of outcomes and unmeasured modes, and the fidelity of the states obtained after applying operations conditional on measurement outcomes. The bounds depend on the LO amplitude and the moments of number operators. We demonstrate the practical relevance of these bounds by evaluating them for standard pulsed homodyne used for estimating values of the characteristic function of the Wigner distribution, expectations of moments, for quantum teleportation and for continuous variable error correction with GKP codes.

Abstract: The fact that gravitational environments cannot be shielded (since gravity is universal) makes them of great theoretical interest to decoherence mechanisms and to the quantum-to-classical transition. While past results seemed to indicate that graviton-induced decoherence of spatial superpositions happens only for macroscopic systems, recently it was shown that this mechanism can be enhanced through the system's own dynamical internal structure. In this work, we extend this analysis by including the interaction with a classical Newtonian potential. We show that, although the graviton bath alone dominates the mechanism for short times compared to a timescale established by the size of the quantum spatial superposition, the interplay between the gravitons and the internal degrees of freedom of the system renders decoherence inevitable in the long-time limit, even for microscopic masses. We also show that this mechanism is slightly slowed down by the interplay with the classical Newtonian potential, which, for systems without dynamical internal degrees of freedom, can even lead to recoherence, at least in principle.

Abstract: Large, 3D trapped ion crystals offer improved sensitivity in quantum sensing protocols, and are expected to be implemented as platforms in near-future experiments. However, numerical techniques used to study the laser cooling of such crystals are inefficient as the number of ions, $N$, in the crystal increases. Here we develop a powerful numerical framework to simulate laser cooling of up to $10^5$ ions stored in a Penning trap. We apply this framework to characterize and optimize the cooling of ellipsoidal 3D crystals. We document new pathways to enhanced cooling based on the addition of an axial component to the potential energy-dominated $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ modes. Furthermore, we observe greatly enhanced cooling of the perpendicular kinetic energy to below 1 mK in prolate ion crystals, enabling a simplified cooling beam setup for such crystals. We propose specific values of trap and laser beam parameters which lead to optimal cooling in a variety of examples. This work illustrates the feasibility of preparing large 3D crystals for high-sensitivity quantum science protocols, motivating their use in future experiments.

Abstract: A quantum amplifier usually adds extra noise inevitably through coupling to internal degrees of freedom while amplifying the signal. The introduction of quantum correlations can effectively suppress this extra noise. In this work, we utilize the established quantum correlation between the Stokes field and atomic spin waves in the Raman amplification process to feedback a portion of the Stokes field into the amplifier. This leads to a reduction in quantum noise that is independent of the feedback loss at high gain. A maximum of 6 dB noise reduction is observed. The single-path feedback amplifier is found to be sensitive to the feedback phase, a property that expands its potential for applications in quantum precision measurement, and the general concept can be extended to integrated optics and fiber optic systems.

Abstract: Estimating thermal expectations of local observables is a natural target for quantum advantage. We give a simple classical algorithm that approximates thermal expectations, and we show it has quasi-polynomial cost $n^{O(\log n/ε)}$ for all temperatures above a phase transition in the free energy. For many natural models, this coincides with the entire fast-mixing, quantumly easy phase. Our results apply to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model at any constant temperature -- including when the thermal state is highly entangled and satisfies polynomial quantum circuit lower bounds, a sign problem, and nontrivial instance-to-instance fluctuations. Our analysis of the SYK model relies on the replica trick to control the complex zeros of the partition function.

Abstract: We study the spectra of collective low excitations of two atomic ion ensembles which are confined in a liner trap by addressing lases. When the left ensemble is driven by an external optical field, its corresponding response spectrum to the incident optical light shows a vibration-induced transparency phenomenon when the detuning of the laser addressing the ion is tuned to the first red sideband. In the case of the detuning tuned to the first blue sideband, the response spectrum shows a conversion from the absorption peak to the transparency window. Furthermore, we investigate the fluctuation spectra of the collective excitation modes of ion ensemble and show the similar phenomena.

Abstract: An experimental implementation of the Coherent One-Way Quantum Key Distribution (COW-QKD) protocol is reported under realistic conditions, and a clean and easy-to-use framework for performing finite key analysis of the COW-QKD protocol is provided by extending a set of existing results. The framework provided here is used to perform finite key rate analysis of the COW-QKD protocol with respect to the actual parameters used in the experimental realization reported here. The system is kept running for several hours with different experimental parameters and stable secure key rates between 1.2 to 1.6 kbps are observed. In addition, QBER, phase error rate and secure key rate are obtained under finite key analysis, and it is shown that COW-QKD is secure for medium-range transmissions (up-to ~ 156 (171) km of optical fiber with 0.2 dB loss per km if detector efficiency is 0.1 (0.2) and other parameters are same as those used in this experiment).

Abstract: The number resolution of solid-state artificial atoms is of fundamental interest for the study of quantum few-body systems, yet remains experimentally challenging. Quantum optical experiments offer a non-invasive approach which links up macroscopic measurements with the quantity of quantum emitters. In this work, we propose a time-domain quantum optical methodology for the strict numbering of colloidal CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) confined in subwavelength-size polystyrene capsules. The non-polarized, homogeneously broadened emission of colloidal QDs in the subwavelength volume satisfies the description of Dicke's superradiance of identical quantum emitters. An analytic relation describes the numerical dependence of the second-order photon correlation on the number and the collective lifetime of emitters, yielding an experimental counting range of colloidal QDs from one to ten. This work provides a robust pathway for the non-invasive numbering of artificial atoms and the investigation of collective light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.

Abstract: We show that noiseless random quantum circuits pass the linear cross-entropy benchmark (LXEB) test with high probability. If the circuits are linear depth, and thus form unitary 4-designs, the LXEB test is passed with probability $1-O(1/\sqrt{k})$, where $k$ is the number of independently drawn samples from the output distribution of the random circuit. If the circuits are of depth $\tilde O(n^2)$, and thus form unitary $n$-designs, the LXEB test is passed with probability $1-O(e^{-k \log(n)/n})$. In proving our results, we show strong concentration of the random circuit collision probability at linear depth and establish that the tails of the distribution of random circuit output probabilities start to resemble Porter-Thomas at near-quadratic depths. Our analysis employs higher moments and high-degree approximate designs.

Abstract: A classic feature of gravity is that it is an attractive force. If a source mass is prepared in a localized (classical- like) state, it will cause another probe mass to move towards it. Here we consider the situation in which a source mass is prepared in a quantum superposition of distinct spatial states while a probe mass interacts with it. Conditional on the detection of the source mass in a specific state, the probe mass will be found to move away from the source mass (repulsion). This signifies the quantum superposition of gravitational forces acting on the probe mass and thereby the fact that spacetime can exist in quantum superpositions. The technique used is the repulsive effect arising from an anomalous negative weak value. A potential experimental implementation with spin bearing nanocrystals is outlined.

Abstract: The discovery of new quantum error-correcting codes that encode several logical qubits into relatively few physical qubits motivates the development of efficient and accurate methods of decoding these systems. Here, we adopt the minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm, a subroutine invaluable to decoding topological codes, to decode bivariate bicycle codes. Using the equivalence of bivariate bicycle codes to copies of the toric code, we propose a method we call the 'cylinder trick' to rapidly find a correction using matching on code symmetries. We benchmark our decoder on the gross code family, cyclic hypergraph-product codes, generalized toric codes, and recently proposed directional codes, demonstrating the general applicability of our protocol. For a subset of these codes, we find that our decoder can be significantly improved by augmenting matching with strategies including belief propagation and 'over-matching', thus achieving performance competitive with state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: In High-Energy Physics, unfolding is the process of reconstructing true distributions of physical observables from detector-distorted measurements. Starting from its reformulation as a regularized quadratic optimization, we develop a framework to tackle this problem using both classical and quantum-compatible methods. In particular, we derive a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) representation of the unfolding objective, allowing direct implementation on quantum annealing and hybrid quantum-classical solvers. The proposed approach is implemented in QUnfold, an open-source Python package integrating classical mixed-integer solvers and D-Wave's hybrid quantum solver. We benchmark the method against widely used unfolding techniques in RooUnfold, including response Matrix Inversion, Iterative Bayesian Unfolding, and Singular Value Decomposition unfolding, using synthetic dataset with controlled distortion effects. Our results demonstrate that the optimization-based approach achieves competitive reconstruction accuracy across multiple distributions while naturally accommodating regularization within the objective function. This work establishes a unified optimization perspective on unfolding and provides a practical pathway for exploring quantum-enhanced methods in experimental HEP data analysis.

Abstract: We investigate the steady state of two single-mode uniform spatially separated polaritonic conden- sates exposed to resonant pumping with entangled pairs of photons. We demonstrate the principal possibility of driving the system to an entangled state despite its exposure to noises arising from the excitonic reservoir and photon leakage through the microcavity mirrors. Estimates are provided for the flux of entangled particles required to drive the system into a steady state that violates the partial-transpose criterion for entanglement. Furthermore, we trace the evolution of the system after a sudden disappearance of the entangled pumping. Our analysis provides estimates for the entanglement lifetime in a system of two exciton-polariton condensates

Abstract: Bohr's principle of complementarity, prohibiting simultaneous access to certain physical properties within a single experimental arrangement, is considered to be a defining feature of quantum mechanics. It is commonly viewed as inducing an intrinsic hierarchy among incompatible observables: some sets of quantum properties are fundamentally more incompatible than others, as quantified by the maximal sharpness permitting their joint measurement. We show that this hierarchy ceases to be absolute in the multi-copy regime. Analyzing qubit spin observables, we prove a No-Comparison Theorem establishing that no global ordering of incompatible observable sets is preserved across all finite-copy configurations. In particular, two sets of observables can exhibit reversed complementarity ordering depending solely on whether the available resources are arranged as identical copies or as parallel-antiparallel pairs. Thus, the degree of quantum incompatibility is not an intrinsic property of observables alone but depends on the global configuration of the prepared quantum probes. Our results uncover a configuration-dependent structure of complementarity, reveal a subtle role of entanglement in shaping the structure of measurement limitations, and call for a reassessment of quantum information protocols under finite resources.

Abstract: Preserving multipartite entanglement in open many-body quantum systems is fundamentally limited by unavoidable environmental noise. We study the open-system dynamics of multipartite entanglement in an anisotropic XXZ spin chain interacting with a thermal spin bath, focusing on two states with distinct types of multipartite entanglement: the generalized GHZ and the generalized W state. Using a master-equation approach combined with the Bethe ansatz technique, we show analytically that robustness of multipartite entanglement at low temperatures can be enhanced by suitably tuning the anisotropy of the system. Our results highlight interaction-induced spectral control as a mechanism for stabilizing multipartite entanglement in quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: Sympathetic laser cooling is a key concept in precision spectroscopy and quantum state control of charged particles. Significant challenges arise in the metrologically relevant case where the effective interaction between the particles is weak and the particle to be cooled exhibits significant initial motional energy. Here we specifically address the most generally applicable case where the laser-cooled ion and the particle of interest are confined to two spatially separate potential wells with equal motional frequency for resonant enhancement of the cooling dynamics. We analyze the latter through numerical simulations and find that anharmonicities of the potential wells can prevent maintaining the resonance condition throughout the cooling process and thus inhibit a significant reduction in motional energy. We propose a cooling scheme that sweeps the trapping frequency of the potential wells. We show that this scheme enables efficient cooling from cryogenic temperatures all the way to the quantum regime of motion. As a specific application scenario, we analyze the sympathetic cooling of (anti-)protons into the quantum regime of motion for quantum-logic-spectroscopy-based tests of CPT invariance at the quantum limit in Penning traps. Nevertheless, our results and cooling strategies are generally applicable to other laser-inaccessible ion species.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are a very promising tool for near-term quantum computing. However, despite their flexibility and wide applicability, their performance is fundamentally limited by Barren Plateaus (BP), where gradients vanish and optimization becomes intractable. Noise-Induced Barren Plateaus (NIBP) are particularly interesting, as they are predicted to arise due to noise accumulation independent of circuit structure. We experimentally study NIBP on IBM quantum hardware and demonstrate their absence under non-unital amplitude damping characterized by the qubit's $T_1$ coherence times. We use Information Content Landscape Analysis (ICLA) to efficiently estimate gradient norms for circuits ranging from 8 to 102 qubits, with hundreds of parameters and circuit runtimes of hundreds of microseconds. Classical simulations of the 8-qubit case under noiseless, depolarizing, amplitude damping, and dephasing noise models serve as a baseline comparison. We thoroughly analyze the experimental results considering calibration data, shot-noise, and circuit structure. We robustly observe that the gradient magnitude saturates beyond a characteristic circuit runtime, in contrast with the exponential decay expected from NIBP. Using recent theoretical results, we corroborate that under $T_1$-dominated noise NIBP do not occur and extract an effective $T_1^\text{eff}$ that is significantly shorter than suggested by standard calibration data. Our results experimentally confirm recent predictions on the absence of NIBP under non-unital noise. These findings also indicate that conventional benchmarking metrics based on average values for device characteristics may be insufficient to predict variational algorithm performance, but full distributions need to be considered.

Abstract: Bias-tailored quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) offer a higher error threshold than standard QECCs and have the potential to achieve lower logical errors with less space overhead. The spin-cat qubit, encoded in a large nuclear spin-$F$ system, is a promising candidate for bias-tailored QECCs. Yet its feasibility is hindered by the difficulty of performing fast covariant SU(2) rotation with arbitrary rotation angles for nuclear spins and by a lack of noise characterization for gate operations in neutral atom platforms. Here we demonstrate single-qubit controls of ${}^{173}\mathrm{Yb}$ spin-cat qubits with nuclear spin $I=5/2$ in an optical tweezer array. We implement a covariant SU(2) rotation and non-linear rotations by optical beams and achieve an averaged single-Clifford gate fidelity of $0.961_{-5}^{+5}$. The measurement of the coherence time and spin relaxation time shows that the idling error becomes increasingly biased toward dephasing errors as the magnitude of the encoded sublevel $|m_F|$ increases. Furthermore, we benchmark the noise bias of rank-preserving gates on spin-cat qubits, demonstrating a finite bias of $18_{-11}^{+132}$, in contrast to the case of the two-level system in ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$, which shows no bias within the experimental uncertainty. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of spin-cat qubits for realizing bias-tailored QECCs, paving the way for achieving hardware-efficient quantum error correction.

Abstract: The amount of extractable work from a physical system is fundamentally connected to the information available about its state, as illustrated by Maxwell's demon and the Gibbs paradox. In standard thermodynamic protocols involving system--bath interactions, the maximum work is given by the free-energy difference between the initial state and the corresponding Gibbs state at the bath temperature. This motivates a natural question: does information also limit work extraction in closed quantum systems that do not involve a heat bath and where work is obtained through unitary operations generated by a time-dependent Hamiltonian? While ergotropy quantifies the maximum work extractable via unitary operations, it assumes complete knowledge of the quantum state, typically requiring full state tomography. In realistic scenarios, however, only partial information is accessible. In this case, the relevant figure of merit is observational ergotropy, which depends explicitly on the measurement used to probe the system. We show that observational ergotropy decreases under classical post-processing of measurement outcomes, implying that fine-grained measurements allow greater work extraction than coarse-grained ones. Moreover, maximizing observational ergotropy over all possible measurements recovers standard ergotropy, which decomposes into incoherent (classical) and coherent (quantum) contributions. Our results demonstrate that coherence in the measurement projectors constitutes the key resource, enabling work extraction beyond the incoherent limit and establishing coherence as the origin of quantum advantage in observational ergotropy extraction.

Abstract: Tailoring error correcting codes to the structure of the physical noise can reduce the overhead of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Hyperbolic Floquet codes use only weight-2 measurements and can be implemented directly on hardware with native pair measurements. We construct hyperbolic and semi-hyperbolic Floquet codes from $\{8,3\}$, $\{10,3\}$, and $\{12,3\}$ tessellations via the Wythoff kaleidoscopic construction with the Low-Index Normal Subgroups (LINS) algorithm. The $\{10,3\}$ and $\{12,3\}$ families are new to hyperbolic Floquet codes. We evaluate these codes under four noise models: phenomenological, ancilla Entangling Measurement (EM3), Single-step Depolarizing EM3 (SDEM3), and erasure. Under phenomenological noise, specific-logical threshold crossings occur near $p_e \approx 0.3$--$0.5\%$ for $\{8,3\}$ ($k=6$--$56$) and $0.15$--$0.2\%$ for $\{10,3\}$ ($k=12$--$146$). EM3 ancilla noise yields a threshold of ${\sim}1.5\%$ for all three families. SDEM3 is a depolarizing noise model motivated by Majorana tetron architectures; fine-grained codes achieve thresholds of ${\sim}1.0$--$1.2\%$ for all three families. The erasure model captures detected photon loss on spin-optical links; fine-grained codes achieve erasure thresholds of ${\sim}8.5$--$9\%$ for $\{8,3\}$, ${\sim}7$--$8\%$ for $\{10,3\}$, and ${\sim}6.5$--$8\%$ for $\{12,3\}$. Photon loss is the dominant error source in photon-mediated quantum computing. Under the full three-parameter SPOQC-2 noise model, the $\{8,3\}$ codes achieve a 2D fault-tolerant area $2.2\times$ that of the surface code compiled to pair measurements while encoding $k = 10$ logical qubits. In a companion paper, we evaluate the same code families in a distributed setting.

We also analyze states exhibiting such squeezing and show its manifestations in the uncertainty of the magnitudes and positions of the intensity fringes. Our work identifies coherence as a fundamental degree of freedom for squeezing, complementing phase, amplitude, and polarization, which could benefit quantum-enhanced interferometry.

Abstract: The security of the proposed quantum Internet relies on repeater protocols designed under the assumption of stochastic, characterizable noise. We demonstrate that in adversarial environments this assumption induces performance vulnerabilities for computationally bounded repeater nodes. We show that the standard BBPSSW distillation protocol recursively purifies error syndromes rather than entanglement. This leads to a state of low fidelity despite diagnostic metrics indicating perfect convergence. Moreover, we show that the verifier cannot check the adversarial influence via the maximum likelihood estimation algorithm since it is blind to computationally bounded observers. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a Cryptographic Network Stack centered on a trapdoor verification protocol. The protocol exploits private randomness to restore operational stability without requiring channel characterization.

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BiCs) convert dissipative open systems into effectively closed quantum subspaces through destructive interference. We show that two identical giant atoms coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide support BICs that coincide with maximally entangled atomic states. Most importantly, entanglement is predominantly determined by the geometric design; the ratio of intra-atomic connection lengths fixes the concurrence, while the propagation phase between atoms selects a family of Bell-like states. We further analyze the dynamical stability of these maximally entangled BICs under exact time evolution, revealing a clear hierarchy of robustness against parameter perturbations. Our results establish an analytical bridge between symmetry, geometry, entanglement, and BICs in giant-atom waveguide platforms.

Abstract: Quantum cloud platforms have become the most widely adopted and mainstream approach for accessing quantum computing resources, due to the scarcity and operational complexity of quantum hardware. In this service-oriented paradigm, quantum circuits, which constitute high-value intellectual property, are exposed to risks of unauthorized access, reuse, and misuse. Digital watermarking has been explored as a promising mechanism for protecting quantum circuits by embedding ownership information for tracing and verification. However, driven by recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, the paradigm of quantum circuit design is shifting from individually and manually constructed circuits to automated synthesis based on quantum circuit generative models (QCGMs). In such generative settings, protecting only individual output circuits is insufficient, and existing post hoc, circuit-centric watermarking methods are not designed to integrate with the generative process, often failing to simultaneously ensure stealthiness, functional correctness, and robustness at scale. These limitations highlight the need for a new watermarking paradigm that is natively integrated with quantum circuit generative models. In this work, we present the first watermarking framework for QCGMs, which embeds ownership signals into the generation process while preserving circuit fidelity. We introduce a symmetric sampling strategy that aligns watermark encoding with the model's Gaussian prior, and a synchronization mechanism that counteracts adversarial watermark attack through latent drift correction. Empirical results confirm that our method achieves high-fidelity circuit generation and robust watermark detection across a range of perturbations, paving the way for scalable, secure copyright protection in AI-powered quantum design.

Abstract: Excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) have been extensively studied in two-level models, but their characterization remains challenging in systems displaying mixed regular and chaotic dynamics. In this work, we investigate ESQPTs within the three-level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, where an enlarged Hilbert space and multiple separatrices give rise to rich spectral structures strongly influenced by chaos. To investigate the different dynamical regions, we have calculated Poincaré sections and Peres lattices. In addition, by combining chaos-sensitive measures with standard ESQPT diagnostics, we provide a static analysis of ESQPT signatures in this model and establish a robust framework for future studies of its dynamical behavior. The degree of chaos and the Kullback-Leibler divergence are found to be very effective chaos-sensitive measures, which are complementary to ESQPT diagnostics such as the mean field limit and the participation ratio. Hence we provide a standard framework to work with ESQPTs in chaotic three-level systems.

Abstract: We construct a probability distribution, induced by the Perron--Frobenius eigenvector of an exponentially large graph, which cannot be efficiently sampled by any classical algorithm, even when provided with the best-possible warm-start distribution. In the quantum setting, this problem can be viewed as preparing the ground state of a stoquastic Hamiltonian given a guiding state as input, and is known to be efficiently solvable on a quantum computer. Our result suggests that no efficient classical algorithm can solve a broad class of stoquastic ground-state problems.
  Our graph is constructed from a class of high-degree, high-girth spectral expanders to which self-similar trees are attached. This builds on and extends prior work of Gilyén, Hastings, and Vazirani [Quantum 2021, STOC 2021], which ruled out dequantization for a specific stoquastic adiabatic path algorithm. We strengthen their result by ruling out any classical algorithm for guided ground-state preparation.

Abstract: Quantum theory departs from classical physics in its treatment of correlations, most prominently through the phenomena of contextuality and nonlocality. Once regarded primarily as foundational curiosities, these effects are now understood as key operational resources for quantum computation, communication, and simulation. Although traditionally investigated in distinct settings, recent theoretical and experimental advances have revealed deep conceptual, mathematical, and operational connections between them. This review presents a unified perspective on these developments based on sheaf-theoretic and graph-theoretic frameworks, which provide theory-independent characterizations of statistical correlations. These approaches clarify the structural relationship between contextuality and nonlocality, facilitate the formulation of experimentally testable inequalities, and guide implementations in realistic physical platforms, with particular emphasis on photonic systems. By bridging abstract theoretical structures and concrete experimental realizations, this review sheds light on the nonclassical foundations of quantum correlations and their emerging role in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum light-matter interfaces, yet single-species arrays are constrained by in-plane symmetry, restricting polarization control. Here we investigate the cooperative optical response of dual-species subwavelength atom arrays, in which intrinsic polarizability difference breaks in-plane symmetry. By engineering the lattice spacing and detunings, the arrays exhibit polarization-dependent subradiant modes, enabling complete reflection of specific polarization component. Leveraging this mechanism, we assemble array units as functional pixels and demonstrate a scalable polarization-selective quantum light modulator. Our work establishes a dynamically reconfigurable atomic-photonic platform for versatile subwavelength quantum optical elements.

Abstract: Photon sources based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) are central to experimental quantum optics and quantum technologies. Their performance is commonly quantified by three metrics: pair-collection probability, heralding efficiency, and spectral purity. In bulk-crystal SPDC, these metrics are known to be mutually constrained, yet the physical origin of the resulting trade-offs is often obscured. We show that these trade-offs originate from the frequency-dependent population of discrete spatial modes in the SPDC emission. By performing a Laguerre-Gauss mode decomposition at each frequency component, we show how spectral-spatial non-separability impacts collection probability, heralding efficiency, and purity. We apply this framework to two widely used quasi-phase-matching configurations: collinear degenerate type-0 and type-II SPDC in periodically poled bulk crystals, and quantify how different phase-matching functions shape the spectral-spatial mode structure. In particular, for type-II SPDC we compare standard periodically poled and aperiodically poled Gaussian phase matching. We experimentally validate some of our theoretical results using spatial- and spectral-projection measurements. This spectral-spatial mode analysis provides a quantitative and predictive framework for understanding and engineering bulk-crystal photon sources, enabling systematic multi-parameter optimization beyond qualitative design guidelines.

Abstract: Quantum metrology promises measurement precision beyond classical limits by exploiting large-scale quantum states, yet realizing this advantage faces two fundamental challenges: the deterministic preparation of non-trivial quantum probes and the efficient extraction of metrological information in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Here, we introduce quantum confocal microscopy in Fock space that simultaneously resolves both challenges. Drawing a direct analogy between classical wave optics and quantum state evolution in a bosonic mode, we construct a confocal system with two Fock-space lenses. The first lens deterministically focuses a coherent state into a quantum probe with a tightly concentrated photon-number distribution, while the second lens maps the metrological information back to the vacuum state for efficient readout. Using a superconducting circuit QED platform, we prepare focused probe states with mean photon numbers up to ${N} = 500$, achieving a 21.5$\pm$1.1 dB compression of the photon-number uncertainty relative to a coherent state, with a scalable quantum circuit of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ operational depth. We demonstrate a displacement sensitivity scaling as $N^{-0.416}$, approaching the Heisenberg scaling ($N^{-0.5}$), and achieve a record metrological gain of 19.06$\pm$0.13 dB beyond the standard quantum limit. This work establishes quantum confocal microscopy as a scalable and practical framework for quantum-enhanced precision measurement, readily extendable to other bosonic platforms and high-dimensional quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Generalized master equations (GMEs) -- time-local but generally neither trace-preserving nor Hermiticity-preserving -- are convenient tools to compute properties of the environment of an open or continuously monitored quantum system. A two-sided master equation yields the fidelity and quantum Fisher information (QFI) of environment states, thereby setting fundamental limits for hypothesis testing and parameter estimation under continuous monitoring. For unmonitored noise or inefficient detection, the QFI of the detectable part of the environment may be obtained from a recently derived GME acting on multiple system replicas. Tilted master equations provide the full counting statistics of quantum jumps and diffusive measurements, enabling, e.g., studies of quantum thermodynamics beyond average values. Here we focus on bosonic linear systems, governed by a quadratic Hamiltonian and linear jump operators, whose dynamics preserves Gaussianity. For Gaussian initial states, we recast a generic GME as a compact set of ordinary differential equations for the covariance matrix (a Riccati-type equation), first moments, and normalization. These equations can be integrated efficiently without Hilbert-space truncation, and admit analytical results in simple settings. We also provide specialized forms for fidelity/QFI and full counting statistics. We illustrate the formalism with a continuously monitored optical parametric oscillator, using it to determine sensitivity limits for frequency estimation and to benchmark Hasegawa's thermodynamic uncertainty relations.

Abstract: We determine conditions on classical group algebra codes so that they have pre-orientation for cup products and copy-cup gates. This defines quantum codes that have constant-depth $\operatorname{CZ}$ and $\operatorname{CCZ}$ gates constructed via tensor products of classical group algebra codes, including hypergraph and balanced products. We show that determining the conditions relies on solving the perfect matching problem in graph theory. Conditions are fully determined for the 2- and 3-copy-cup gates, for group algebra codes up to weight 4, including for codes with odd check weight. These include the bivariate bicycle codes, which we show do not have the pre-orientation for either type of copy-cup gate. We show that abelian weight 4 group algebra codes satisfying the non-associative 3-copy-cup gate necessarily have a code distance of 2, whereas codes that satisfy conditions for the symmetric 3-copy-cup gate can have higher distances, and in fact also satisfy conditions for the 2-copy-cup gate. Finally we find examples of quantum codes from the product of abelian group algebra codes that have inter-code constant-depth $\operatorname{CZ}$ and $\operatorname{CCZ}$ gates.

Abstract: Operational probes of the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity in the Newtonian regime -- via mass-energy equivalence in clocks or spatial superpositions in interferometers -- share a common description in terms of an effective qubit-qubit Ising coupling. Here we generalize both paradigms to interacting $(N+1)$-level effective qudits made of atomic ensembles with particle number, $N$. The many-body enhancement boosts the signal-to-noise and increases the effective interaction rate, facilitating the observation of gravitationally induced entanglement and decoherence, certified by metrological witnesses based on local and collective measurements. Furthermore, we show that quantum effects induced by gravitational interaction can be simulated by trapped bimodal Bose-Einstein condensates with long-range (e.g. dipolar) coupling, providing a programmable analogue platform to explore gravitating quantum dynamics at accessible time and energy scales. Finally, extending the protocol to a sensor network broadens the entanglement-detection window.

Abstract: The extreme sensitivity of chaotic systems to external perturbations makes them natural candidates for sensing applications. We propose a single-shot echo-based protocol for estimating small rotations about an unknown axis that leverages random symmetric probe states prepared via chaotic dynamics. In contrast to previous protocols for this axis-agnostic rotation sensing problem that depend on difficult-to-prepare anticoherent states, the random probe states used in our protocol can be prepared via constant-depth chaotic circuits composed of random one-axis twisting pulses. We demonstrate analytically that our protocol achieves Heisenberg scaling relative to an arbitrary rotation axis that need not be a priori known. We also investigate the effects of collective and single-particle dephasing in our protocol using analytical and numerical tools. While the requirements on dephasing rates to maintain Heisenberg sensitivity are strict, they are achievable in near-term experiments, for instance, for magnetometric rotosensing with high-spin lanthanide atoms such as dysprosium-164.

Abstract: We analyse a continuous-time random walk model with stochastic reversals of direction. There is no external potential but the reorientation mechanism generates a non-zero current from asymmetry in the forward and backward waiting-time distributions (even when they have the same mean); the system can therefore can be considered as a type of active particle ratchet. We derive an explicit expression for the mean ratchet current with exponentially distributed reorientation times and also develop a general renewal-theory framework to obtain the full large deviations, using this to comment on the possibility of dynamical phase transitions.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamical origin of high--temperature superconductivity remains a central challenge of strongly correlated quantum matter. Conventional approaches to quantum criticality assume overdamped Markovian dissipation governed by Ohmic Landau damping. Here we show that infrared collective dynamics is instead generically controlled by the time--scale density of states (TDOS) of relaxation modes. Within the Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--De Dominicis formalism, we derive an exact spectral representation of the collective susceptibility in terms of the TDOS. A finite infrared TDOS defines a new universality class of memory--dominated critical dynamics characterized by long--time kernels $K(t)\sim1/t$ and nonanalytic dynamical response. This spectral reorganization produces a strong infrared amplification of the particle--particle channel, converting the marginal instabilities of BCS and Eliashberg theories into algebraic superconducting transitions. As a result, the transition temperature scales linearly with the infrared spectral weight of slow collective modes, naturally yielding superconducting domes and Uemura scaling without invoking bosonic glue or fine tuning. The same slow--mode reservoir governs anomalous normal--state dynamics, including long--time correlations and strange--metal behavior, providing a unified description of thermodynamic and dynamical phenomena in correlated superconductors. Our results establish dynamical spectral organization as a fundamental principle of quantum critical matter and identify memory--dominated criticality as a generic route to high--temperature superconductivity.

Abstract: We investigate Coulomb spin liquids in classical spin-3/2 ice and show that the enlarged on-site Hilbert space gives rise to a qualitatively new class of such phases. Beyond the conventional magnetic monopoles of spin-1/2 ice, the system hosts additional low-energy crystal-field excitations, whose interplay with monopoles significantly modifies both equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties. Following a thermal quench, we find a pronounced dynamical arrest manifested in an exponentially long-lived {athermal} plateau in spin autocorrelations. This constitutes a rare example of dynamical arrest in a short-range interacting, disorder-free system. We demonstrate that the arrested dynamics originate from novel composite excitation structures unique to spin-3/2 ice and from kinetically constrained relaxation pathways that require activated processes. Our results establish higher-spin ice as a fertile platform for realising unconventional Coulomb spin liquids and dynamical arrest without quenched disorder.

Abstract: The interaction-driven evolution from a Fermi liquid to a Mott insulator is a hallmark of strongly correlated fermion systems. In this work, we present a {\it numerically unbiased} study of such metal-to-insulator crossover in the half-filled square-lattice Hubbard model at finite temperatures, employing auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method. By jointly analyzing thermodynamic and dynamical observables, we establish the crossover diagram of the model in the temperature-interaction ($T$-$U$) plane. With increasing $U$, our numerical results reveal an extended crossover regime, which we refer to as the {\it Bad Metal}, that separates the Fermi liquid and Mott insulator. During the crossover, we also examine the antiferromagnetic spin correlations and observe pronounced nodal-antinodal dichotomy in the momentum-resolved single-particle spectral functions. Furthermore, we investigate the temperature dependence of several commonly used observables in the model. As representative results, we achieve an accurate map of the thermal entropy across the crossover diagram, and identify the parameter regions in which the model exhibits the Pomeranchuk cooling, characterized by an adiabatic cooling with increasing $U$. Beyond offering a more refined understanding of the crossover phenomenon, our work also provides valuable benchmark and guideline for future optical lattice experiments on the square-lattice Hubbard model.

Abstract: We investigate lattice dynamics in LaCoO$_3$ using inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering over $T = 2\mbox{-}650\,\mathrm{K}$, spanning the spin-state crossover at $T_{1} \approx 100\,\mathrm{K}$ and the insulator--metal transition at $T_{2} \approx 550\,\mathrm{K}$. Comparison with quasi-harmonic $ab-initio$ lattice-dynamical calculations helps reveal anomalous softening of a $\approx 10\,\mathrm{meV}$ oxygen phonon, confined to the temperature interval $T_{1} \leq T \leq T_{2}$ and localized in momentum space at $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{SSO}} = \left( \frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2} \right)_{c}$. This wave vector corresponds to the spin-state ordering originally proposed by Goodenough [J. Phys. Chem. Solids 6, 287-297 (1958)]. Our results therefore provide momentum-resolved evidence for dynamic correlations of high-spin and low-spin Co$^{3+}$ states in LaCoO$_{3}$, linking spin-state fluctuations to anomalous phonon renormalization.

Abstract: Using the formalism of pseudospin and isospin operators the Hamiltonian of an effective Kugel-Khomskii model with spin-orbit coupling is derived with an exact account of the $t_{2g}$ multiplet splitting by the crystal field. An analytical solution is obtained for an arbitrary relation between the Hubbard repulsion and crystal field splitting, i.e., interpolating the cases of Mott-Hubbard and charge-transfer insulators. A description of orbital orders is given in terms of octupole moments. The ground-state phase diagram is constructed in the parameter space spanned by spin-orbit coupling, Hund's exchange, and Hubbard interaction. We investigate a quantum phase transition between a state exhibiting hidden magnetic and orbital long-range order and a ferromagnetic state with a reduced magnetic moment accompanied by antiferroorbital order. It is shown that the cooperative effect of Hund's and spin-orbit interactions gives rise to an easy-plane-type anisotropy.

Abstract: We identify an interesting regime in the physics of pyrochlore magnets in which spin-orbit and crystal field effects lead to {\em two} low-lying magnetic doublets that can be modeled as an effective spin $S=3/2$ degree of freedom that sees a dominant easy-axis antiferromagnetic exchange $J>0$ favoring the local $[111]$ axes, which competes with a comparably strong single-ion anisotropy $Δ= J+μ/2$ (with $|μ| \ll J$) favoring the perpendicular planes. For a precise analysis, we study the $T/J \rightarrow 0$ limit in which $w \equiv \exp(-μ/T)$ is the control variable. In this limit, we find {\em two topologically distinct} zero-field Coulomb phases separated by a first-order $Z_3$ confinement transition at $w_c \approx 2.02$. Both Coulomb phases admit a description in terms of the fluctuations of a coarse-grained divergence-free polarization field. However, the flux of this polarization field is restricted to integer multiples of $3$, and only charges that are multiples of 3 are deconfined in one of these phases, while all integer fluxes are allowed and all integer charges are deconfined in the other phase. Experimental systems with small negative $μ$ ({\em i.e.}, $-J \ll μ< 0$) are therefore predicted to exhibit signatures of this topological transition when cooled below $T_c \approx 1.42|μ|$.

Abstract: We report an extremely rich ground state phase diagram of two spin-1 Haldane chains frustrated with a three-site exchange and coupled by the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction on a zig-zag ladder. A particular feature of the phase diagram is the extended quantum phase transition in the Ashkin-Teller universality class that separates the plaquette phase, which spontaneously breaks translation symmetry, and the uniform disordered phase. The former is connected to the Haldane phase, stabilized by large inter-chain coupling, via the topological Gaussian transition. Upon decreasing the inter-chain interactions, this intermediate disorder phase vanishes, giving place to a dimerized phase separated from the plaquette phase on one side via a non-magnetic Ising transition and from the Haldane phase on the other side by a topological weak first-order transition. Finally, in the limit of two decoupled chains, we recover a quantum critical point that corresponds to two copies of the Wess-Zumino-Witten $\mathrm{SU(2)}_2$ criticality with a total central charge $c=3$.

Abstract: The R3MBi5 rare-earth intermetallics (R = rare earth, M = Ti, Zr, Sc) provide a versatile platform to explore how Kondo hybridization, RKKY exchange, magnetic frustration, and broken inversion symmetry may cooperate to generate unusual magnetic behavior. We present a comprehensive neutron scattering investigation of the magnetic structure, crystal electric field (CEF), and low-energy excitations in the locally noncentrosymmetric Kondo-lattice compounds Ce3TiBi5 and Ce3ZrBi5. Powder and single-crystal neutron diffraction reveals incommensurate cycloidal antiferromagnetic order in Ce3TiBi5 with propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0.388) and a reduced ordered moment of m = 0.53(3)$μ_{B}$. Ce3ZrBi5 exhibits a qualitatively similar magnetic diffraction profile, with k $\simeq$ (0, 0, 0.37). Inelastic neutron scattering measurements resolve two clear, well-separated CEF excitations in both compounds with nearly the same profile, confirming a well-isolated Kramers doublet ground state. At low energies, a broad, quasi-elastic magnetic response is observed at T $\simeq$ TN, whose momentum-dependence is inconsistent with that expected from conventional collective excitations of localized moments. This discrepancy, along with a Kondo temperature estimate TK ~ 3--5 K -- comparable to TN -- indicates sizable Kondo hybridization, which accounts for the moment reduction and the spiral magnetic order that appears to involve the magnetic hard direction. Our results place these compounds in a regime where local inversion symmetry breaking, anisotropic CEF effects, and competing Kondo and RKKY interactions collectively give rise to unconventional magnetic order.
