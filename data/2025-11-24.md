### [1] [Unconventional Geometric Phase in Twisted Junction of Cuprates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17033)
*Zhigang Song,Kai Chang*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Researchers discovered an electronic geometric phase in twisted cuprates, analogous to the optical Pancharatnam-Berry phase, enabling chiral superconducting current filtering in non-chiral systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to explore the electronic counterpart of the Pancharatnam-Berry phase in electronic systems, a concept previously overlooked due to the absence of electron polarization.

Method: Large-scale first-principles calculations were used to investigate the electronic structure of twisted bilayer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8.

Result: Spontaneous spin polarization and hidden flat bands emerged at the interface between atomic layers. An unconventional geometric phase was discovered, exerting opposite effects on superconducting currents of opposite chirality.

Conclusion: The study uncovers an unconventional geometric phase in twisted bilayer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8, analogous to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase in optics, which influences superconducting currents of opposite chirality. This enables twisted cuprates to filter chiral superconducting currents, even in non-chiral ground states.

Abstract: Originally introduced in optics, the Pancharatnam-Berry phase is a general concept of geometric phase defined for any two interfering polarization states. In electronic systems, however, its counterpart has long been overlooked due to the absence of electron polarization. Here, using large-scale first-principles calculations, we investigate the electronic structure of twisted bilayer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8. We find spontaneous spin polarization and the emergence of hidden flat bands at the interface between atomic layers. Most notably, we discover an unconventional geometric phase analogous to the Pancharatnam-Berry phase in optics. This electronic geometric phase exerts opposite effects on superconducting currents of opposite chirality, enabling twisted cuprates to act as a filter for chiral superconducting current-even if the ground state itself is non-chiral.

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Thick rhombohedral graphene surface states show ferromagnetic and superconducting phases, with superconductivity persisting at zero field due to coupled surface superconductors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the electronic structure and correlated states in thick rhombohedral graphene, particularly focusing on surface states beyond the typical 9-layer limit.

Method: Layer-resolved capacitance measurements, electronic transport, and local magnetometry on 13-layer rhombohedral graphene devices.

Result: Surface states exhibit ferromagnetic phases (valley-imbalanced quarter metals and spin-polarized regions) and localized superconducting states. Superconductivity persists at zero displacement field, violating the Pauli limit.

Conclusion: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene hosts ferromagnetic and superconducting phases in its surface states, even at zero displacement field, suggesting the presence of two independent surface superconductors coupled through the insulating bulk.

Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has recently emerged as a rich platform for studying correlation driven magnetic, topological and superconducting states. While most experimental efforts have focused on devices with N$\leq 9$ layers, the electronic structure of thick rhombohedral graphene features flat-band surface states even in the infinite layer limit. Here, we use layer resolved capacitance measurements to directly detect these surface states for $N\approx 13$ layer rhombohedral graphene devices. Using electronic transport and local magnetometry, we find that the surface states host a variety of ferromagnetic phases, including both valley imbalanced quarter metals and broad regimes of density in which the system spontaneously spin polarizes. We observe several superconducting states localized to a single surface state. These superconductors appear on the unpolarized side of the density-tuned spin transitions, and show strong violations of the Pauli limit consistent with a dominant attractive interaction in the spin-triplet, valley-singlet pairing channel. In contrast to previous studies of rhombohedral multilayers, however, we find that superconductivity can persist to zero displacement field where the system is inversion symmetric. Energetic considerations suggest that superconductivity in this regime is described by the existence of two independent surface superconductors coupled via tunneling through the insulating single crystal graphite bulk.

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Study shows how disorder and magnetic fields affect superconducting films, with results aligning theory and experiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how disorder and magnetic fields influence inhomogeneities in superconducting correlations.

Method: Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on thin films of \ce{Sr2VO_{3-\text{x}}FeAs} layer structures under zero and finite orbital magnetic fields.

Result: Theoretical results align well with experimental findings, revealing similarities in the evolution of superconducting inhomogeneities under disorder and magnetic fields.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a crossover from Abrikosov to Josephson vortex character with increasing disorder in superconducting films, providing predictive guidance for interpreting experimental data in complex superconductors.

Abstract: Emerging granularity in superconducting films by tuning disorder is a well-studied topic, both theoretically and experimentally. However, the orbital magnetic field generates a vortex lattice and contributes to the formation of periodic inhomogeneities. Here, we study superconducting films in the simultaneous presence of disorder and a magnetic field, examining how inhomogeneities in various superconducting correlations evolve under these two perturbations. By performing scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on thin films of \ce{Sr2VO_{3-\text{x}}FeAs} layer structures under both zero and finite orbital magnetic fields, we report impressive similarities between our theoretical results and the experimental findings. Our results have strong implications for identifying the nature of vortices in disordered superconductors, demonstrating a crossover from Abrikosov to Josephson character with increasing disorder, and provide predictive guidance for interpreting STS and current mapping data in complex superconductors.

### [4] [A path to high temperature superconductivity via strong short range repulsion in spin polarized band](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17466)
*Zhiyu Dong,Patrick A. Lee*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Strong repulsion in 2D spin-polarized metals can lead to controlled expansion and pairing, with $f$-wave pairing and high $T_c$ potential in specific lattice models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore the behavior of strongly repulsive, spin-polarized metals in two dimensions, particularly focusing on the conditions under which pairing and controlled expansion occur despite the repulsion.

Method: Two models were analyzed: a tight-binding model on a triangular lattice with nearest neighbor repulsion and a second model on the same lattice with Wannier orbitals of size comparable to the unit cell spacing.

Result: The study shows that Pauli exclusion enables controlled expansion, leading to pairing in many cases. Specifically, $f$-wave pairing with order unity pairing strength was found in the Wannier orbital model, suggesting potential for high $T_c$.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that strong repulsive interactions in a two-dimensional spin-polarized metal can lead to controlled expansion and pairing, with the potential for high transition temperatures ($T_c$) in specific lattice models.

Abstract: We consider a two dimensional metal that is spin polarized and with strongly repulsive interaction. The interaction is short-ranged and controlled by a screening plane located a distance $d$ away. We consider the case where $d$ is less than the unit cell spacing $a$. We show that due to Pauli exclusion, a controlled expansion is possible despite the strong repulsion, and in many cases results in pairing. We demonstrate this for a tight-binding model on a triangular lattice with nearest neighbor repulsion. We also treat a second model on the triangular lattice with Wannier orbitals with size comparable to $a$. In this case we find $f$-wave pairing with order unity pairing strength, potentially leading to high $T_c$.

### [5] [Liouvillian topology and non-reciprocal dynamics in open Floquet chains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16742)
*Florian Koch,Yu-Min Hu,Jan Carl Budich*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper investigates topological properties in driven open quantum systems, identifying a new jump-induced topological phase and revealing transient non-Hermitian skin effects, providing insights into unidirectional transport in quantum dissipative Floquet dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore topological phenomena in open quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium, particularly focusing on nonreciprocal transport properties linked to spectral winding numbers in dissipative systems.

Method: The authors introduce a microscopic lattice model of a driven open quantum system described by a Markovian quantum master equation, extending beyond the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approximation to include quantum jump processes.

Result: The analysis reveals a new 'jump-induced' topological phase, distinct from the non-Hermitian approximation, and demonstrates that the non-Hermitian skin effect appears in transient dynamics even with periodic boundary conditions.

Conclusion: The study provides a theoretical framework for understanding unidirectional transport in quantum dissipative Floquet dynamics, highlighting the nuanced relationship between non-Hermitian topological properties and Liouvillian topological properties in open quantum systems.

Abstract: Open quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium can exhibit remarkable physical phenomena including topological properties without a direct equilibrium counterpart. Along these lines, in periodically driven dissipative systems within the effective non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian approximation spectral winding numbers have been linked to intriguing nonreciprocal transport properties. Here, going beyond an NH Hamiltonian description, we introduce and study a microscopic lattice model of a driven open quantum system described by a Markovian quantum master equation, which exhibits the mentioned spectral winding within a NH approximation. By encompassing quantum jump processes in the topological analysis, we uncover a distinct \emph{jump-induced} topological phase, which qualitatively corresponds to the richer non-reciprocal transport properties of the fully quantum model. In addition, we find that the NH skin effect, i.e.~the accumulation of a macroscopic number of eigenstates at one end of the system, is already visible in the transient dynamics even for systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our results exemplify the subtle correspondence between NH topological properties and physical manifestations of Liouvillian topological properties in open quantum systems, thus providing a theoretical framework towards understanding unidirectional transport in quantum dissipative Floquet dynamics.

### [6] [Fabrication of A Dual Gated Mirror Symmetric Twisted Trilayer Graphene Device to Study Superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16784)
*Ahmed Shaikh,Phanibhusan Singha Mahapatra,Eva Y. Andrei*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Moiré materials with twisted graphene layers enable tunable electronic states and high-temperature superconductivity study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore correlated states like Mott insulators and superconductivity in moiré materials, driven by their unique flat bands and tunable electronic properties.

Method: A general fabrication approach for creating layered moiré devices is detailed, focusing on maximizing tunability of electronic properties.

Result: These materials exhibit superconductivity similar to high-temperature superconductors, offering a cost-effective and efficient study platform.

Conclusion: The detailed fabrication method of layered moiré materials provides a path to study high-temperature superconductivity, leveraging their tunable 2D nature.

Abstract: Though research on graphene by itself has waned, the interest in moire materials, materials made with stacked layers of graphene with a rotational twist between the layers, has exploded in popularity. These layered devices show a key feature, flat bands. Flat bands localize electrons, which in turn leads to the expression of correlated states such as Mott insulators, superconductivity, and more. A key property of these devices is that their 2D nature allows us to tune them in situ, effectively allowing us to change the device's electronic properties. This powerful ability greatly reduces the time and money required to study superconductivity. The superconductivity in these systems seems to be similar to high-temperature superconductors such as cuprates, giving us a path towards studying high-temperature superconductivity. The fabrication of these devices is nontrivial, and thus we detail one general way to create these layered devices to give maximal tunability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unconventional conductivity behavior observed in topological semimetals hosting spin-1 chiral fermions, focusing on the role of multifold band crossings and disorder-induced broadening.

Method: The self-consistent Born approximation was used to study the energy-dependent electrical conductivity in spin-1 chiral fermion systems with disorder.

Result: A cusp-like feature in electrical conductivity at an energy distinct from the band-crossing point was observed, with its position and conductivity value sensitive to impurity scattering strength and trivial band curvature.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical influence of multifold band crossings and disorder on the transport properties of spin-1 chiral fermion systems, providing theoretical insights into unconventional conductivity behavior in topological semimetals.

Abstract: The energy-dependent electrical conductivity in spin-1 chiral fermion systems with disorder is studied using the self-consistent Born approximation. A distinct cusp-like feature appears at an energy different from the band-crossing point, arising from the multifold band-crossing structure formed by the Dirac and trivial bands. The energy position of the cusp and the corresponding value of the electrical conductivity are found to depend sensitively on both the impurity scattering strength and the curvature of the trivial band. These findings demonstrate the critical role of multifold band crossings and disorder-induced broadening of energy levels in determining the transport properties, offering theoretical insight into the unconventional conductivity behavior observed in topological semimetals hosting spin-1 chiral fermions.

### [8] [Giant Nonlinear Photon-Drag Currents in Centrosymmetric Moiré Bilayers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16987)
*Zhuocheng Lu,Zhuang Qian,Zhichao Guo,Likun Shi,Shi Liu,Hua Wang,Kai Chang*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A geometric framework explains nonlinear photon-drag currents in TBG, showing tunable optoelectronic responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a transparent quantum-geometric interpretation and numerical tractability of nonlinear photon-drag currents.

Method: A unified microscopic theory based on a geometric-loop framework, applied to twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with ab initio accuracy.

Result: Photon-drag currents in centrosymmetric TBG are sizable and broadly tunable by twist angle, photon wavevector, and light polarization.

Conclusion: The study establishes a quantum geometric framework for nonlinear photon-drag phenomena and identifies moiré bilayers as promising platforms for highly tunable optoelectronic responses.

Abstract: We present a unified microscopic theory of nonlinear photon-drag currents, formulated within a geometric-loop framework that provides both transparent quantum-geometric interpretation and numerical tractability. In this picture, the photon-drag shift current corresponds to the dipole moment of the geometric loop, while the photon-drag injection current arises from the same loop weighted by a band velocity difference. We apply the theory to an exact continuum model of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with ab initio accuracy. Remarkably, an in-plane wavevector only a few times larger than that of free-space photons already produces sizable photon-drag currents in centrosymmetric TBG, comparable to photogalvanic responses in typical noncentrosymmetric two-dimensional materials. These currents are broadly tunable by twist angle, photon wavevector, and light polarization. Our results establish a quantum geometric framework for nonlinear photon-drag phenomena and highlight moiré bilayers as promising platforms for large, highly tunable optoelectronic responses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of the von Neumann architecture by exploring new computational paradigms like quantum and neuromorphic computing, which require resilient and reliable operation.

Method: The work demonstrates a topological field-effect memristor based on inverted InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum wells operating in the quantum spin Hall regime.

Result: The device combines electrically tunable coherent and incoherent transport with memory functionality, achieving one resistance state through dissipationless coherent transport and another through incoherent bulk conduction.

Conclusion: The device realizes a prototypical topological electronic element integrating coherent transport and adaptive memristive behavior, paving the way for hybrid quantum-neuromorphic architectures.

Abstract: Overcoming the limitations of the von Neumann architecture requires new computational paradigms capable of solving complex problems efficiently. Quantum and neuromorphic computing rely on unconventional materials and device functionalities, yet achieving resilience to imperfections and reliable operation remains a major challenge. This has motivated growing interest in topological materials that provide robust and low-power operation while preserving coherence. However, integrating coherent topological transport with non-volatile memory functionality in a single reconfigurable device has remained challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a topological field-effect memristor based on inverted InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum wells operating in the quantum spin Hall regime. The intrinsic floating-gate behavior allows one to reconfigure the transistor functionality into memristive functionality with broad electric-field tunability. Unlike other memristor implementations, one resistance state is governed entirely by dissipationless, coherent transport through helical edge channels, while the other arises from incoherent bulk conduction. By combining electrically tunable coherent and incoherent transport with memory functionality, our device realizes a prototypical topological electronic element that integrates coherent transport and adaptive memristive behavior, paving the way for hybrid quantum-neuromorphic architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study defect spectroscopy in 2D field-effect transistors (FETs) with minimal contact and disorder artifacts while preserving intrinsic carrier dynamics.

Method: Utilized ReS2-hBN FETs with few-layer graphene (FLG) van der Waals contacts to form nearly barrier-free interfaces, enabling intrinsic transport in ReS2. Observed random telegraph noise (RTN) and analyzed its evolution with temperature.

Result: Direct observation of RTN even in micron-scale channels, identified substitutional carbon-related centers in hBN as dominant defects, and demonstrated the evolution of RTN into a 1/f spectrum with increasing temperature.

Conclusion: A generalizable approach for probing dielectric-origin defect dynamics in intrinsically conducting, low-symmetry 2D semiconductors is established.

Abstract: Defect spectroscopy in two-dimensional (2D) field-effect transistors (FETs) requires device architectures that suppress contact and disorder artifacts while preserving intrinsic carrier dynamics. Here, we demonstrate ReS$_2$-hBN FETs with few-layer graphene (FLG) van der Waals contacts that form nearly barrier-free interfaces, enabling intrinsic transport in ReS$_2$, an anisotropic, low-symmetry TMDC rarely exhibiting disorder-free behavior. The clean ReS$_2$-FLG platform allows direct observation of random telegraph noise (RTN) even in micron-scale channels, manifested as discrete two-level current fluctuations between 90-150 K arising from stochastic trapping at localized hBN defect sites. With increasing temperature, the RTN evolves into a 1/f spectrum as multiple traps activate. Statistical analysis of RTN amplitudes and capture-emission kinetics identifies substitutional carbon-related centers in hBN as dominant defects. These findings establish a generalizable approach for probing dielectric-origin defect dynamics in intrinsically conducting, low-symmetry 2D semiconductors.

Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional lithography-based deposition methods, which introduce undesirable effects, and to explore the superconducting proximity effect in unconventional materials like graphene.

Method: The method involves using via contact and dry transfer techniques to create van der Waals-like contact between NbN/Pd and graphene, achieving a low contact resistance of approximately 130 Ω·μm.

Result: Gate-tunable supercurrent, Fraunhofer pattern, and Andreev reflections were observed, with properties explained by an induced superconducting gap Δ'. Potential mechanisms impacting Δ' and ways to enhance proximity coupling were discussed.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the success of a lithography-free, gentle contact method for creating smooth and low-resistance interfaces between 3D superconductors and graphene, enabling the engineering of novel superconducting heterostructures.

Abstract: The coupling of superconductivity to unconventional materials may lead to novel quantum states and potential applications. Controlling the quality of the superconductor-normal metal interface is of crucial importance to the understanding and engineering of the superconducting proximity effect. In many cases, conventional lithography-based deposition methods introduce undesirable effects. Using the concept of via contact and dry transfer, we have constructed smooth, van der Waals-like contact between 3D superconducting NbN/Pd and graphene with low contact resistance of approximately 130 $Ω\cdot μm$. Gate-tunable supercurrent, Fraunhofer pattern, and Andreev reflections are observed, the properties of which can be understood using an induced superconducting gap $Δ$' in this planar contact geometry. We discuss potential mechanisms impacting the magnitude of $Δ$' and suggest ways of further increasing the proximity coupling. This gentle, lithography-free contacting method can be applied to air- and damage-sensitive surfaces to engineer novel superconducting heterostructures.

Result: An optimal superlattice constant of 14 nm was identified, yielding a maximum solar cell efficiency of 13.3%. Further increase in the superlattice constant enhances miniband-related absorption but reduces efficiency due to decreased generation rate in the n-type region.

Conclusion: The proposed multiscale approach, integrating theoretical, experimental, and computational components, provides a reliable framework for assessing solar cells based on quantum dot superlattices.

Abstract: We present a multiscale approach for modeling an intermediate-band solar cell based on a GaAs-GaAlAs quantum dot superlattice of cubic symmetry. Our framework combines high-accuracy theoretical calculations of the superlattice band structure and miniband-related absorption coefficient with experimentally determined interband absorption data. The quantum-mechanically derived absorption spectrum is incorporated into a drift-diffusion transport model in COMSOL Multiphysics, where key processes, including thermal and radiative recombination, are taken into account. This integrated methodology enables realistic modeling of device performance. Our results identify an optimal superlattice constant of 14 nm, yielding a maximum solar cell efficiency of 13.3 percent. Further increase in the superlattice constant enhances the miniband-related absorption peak but reduces the generation rate in the n-type region, resulting in a net efficiency decrease. The proposed approach, integrating theoretical, experimental, and computational components, provides a reliable framework for assessing solar cells based on quantum dot superlattices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the regime where interacting electrons exhibit both spin and valley degeneracy, leading to SU(4) Kondo physics, which is challenging to realize in typical mesoscopic systems.

Method: Conductance measurements of a quantum point contact (QPC) in bilayer graphene (BLG), including observation of the '0.7 anomaly' and analysis under varying magnetic fields.

Result: Observation of Kondo signatures with a Kondo temperature range of 0.5 to 2.4 K, indicating transitions between SU(4) and SU(2) Kondo effects under different conditions.

Conclusion: The study of a quantum point contact in bilayer graphene reveals signatures of SU(4) Kondo physics, transitioning to SU(2) under specific conditions, demonstrating the versatility of BLG QPCs for exploring many-body effects.

Abstract: The interaction between itinerant electrons and localized spins is key to a wide range of electronic phenomena. Of particular interest is the regime where the interacting electrons exhibit both spin and valley degeneracy, resulting in SU(4) Kondo physics. However, this regime is challenging to realize in typical mesoscopic systems because it requires a strong interaction between electrons, resulting in a Kondo temperature ($T_\mathrm{K}$) significantly larger than the spin and valley splittings. Here, we present conductance measurements of a quantum point contact (QPC) in bilayer graphene (BLG). Beyond the expected quantized conductance plateaus, which reflect spin and valley degeneracy, we observe an additional subband, known as `0.7 anomaly' exhibiting signatures of Kondo physics and a $T_\mathrm{K}$ ranging from approximately 0.5 up to 2.4 K at zero magnetic field, corresponding to Kondo energies between 40 and 200 $μ$eV. Given that the spin-orbit splitting in BLG is between 40 and 80 $μ$eV, we argue that these results are consistent with a transition between four-fold degenerate SU(4) and two-fold degenerate spin-valley locked SU(2) Kondo effects. Furthermore, we break the valley degeneracy of the lowest subband by an out-of-plane magnetic field and show that Kondo signatures remain present, indicating a transition from SU(4) to a valley-polarized SU(2) Kondo effect, and showing the versatility of BLG QPCs for exploring many-body effects.

Conclusion: 该研究发现高对称性晶体（如CoPt）中也可以实现非传统的自旋输运效应（CSOT和CIHE），为实际自旋电子学应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The symmetry of a material fundamentally governs its spin transport properties. While unconventional spin transport phenomena have been predominantly explored in low-symmetry systems (e.g., $C_{1v}$ symmetry), high-symmetry crystals--which constitute the majority of industry-compatible materials--are generally expected to exhibit only conventional spin-transport behavior. Here, we report the coexistence of two unconventional spin transport effects, the crystal spin-orbit torque (CSOT) and the crystal in-plane Hall effect (CIHE), in a CoPt single ferromagnetic layer with $C_{3v}$ symmetry. Leveraging the CSOT, we achieve nearly 100% field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in a 6 nm CoPt layer at room temperature. Simultaneously, the CIHE observed in this material exhibits nearly identical dependencies on both current angle and growth temperature as the CSOT. Symmetry analysis confirms that both effects share a common physical origin. Our work not only establishes CoPt as a high-performance spin-orbit material, but also demonstrates that unconventional spin transport can be realized in high-symmetry systems, thereby opening a broad pathway for their application in practical spintronics.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the gap-opening behavior in the presence of a lattice exhibits rich phenomenology, including layered Chern insulating states and distinct behaviors of surface Fermi-arc states during transitions.

Abstract: An external orbital magnetic field applied perpendicular to the separation vector of a pair of Weyl points can couple them and induce a gap in the electronic spectrum. In this work, we investigate the gap-opening behavior in the presence of a lattice, revealing rich phenomenology absent in the continuum picture. Specifically, we address the emergence of layered Chern insulating states, examining how the anisotropy of the Weyl cone dispersion influences the sequence of phase transitions, and establishing connections to the continuum limit. We analyze the evolution of surface Fermi-arc states across these regimes, highlighting their distinct behaviors during the gap-opening transitions.

Conclusion: The study presents a novel single-photon detector for the microwave domain with high efficiency and fast time resolution, opening new opportunities in quantum sensing and related fields.

Abstract: We demonstrate a single-photon detector operating in the microwave domain, based on photo-assisted quasiparticle tunneling events that poison a superconducting island. The detection relies on continuously monitoring the island's charge parity using microwave reflectometry. This scheme achieves 10% detection efficiency with sub 50 ns time resolution and short dead time 1 microsecond, for microwave photons at 10 GHz. The detector features three junctions connected to a superconducting island, which together carry out photoelectric conversion and charge readout. The enhanced light-matter coupling, crucial to photon to quasiparticle conversion, is provided by a granular aluminum-based high-impedance microwave resonator. The time resolved detection of itinerant microwave photon opens up new perspectives in quantum sensing, microwave quantum optics, readout of superconducting qubits and mesoscopic physics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict the topology of superlattice-induced minibands efficiently, especially in materials with spin-orbit coupling, and to broaden the pool of candidate materials for topological flat bands.

Method: Develop a symmetry indicator framework and algorithm using a perturbatively weak superlattice potential, extending to time-reversal breaking systems to compute Chern numbers.

Result: Derived a compact formula for the Z2 invariant of the lowest miniband and applied the theory to various materials, revealing that topological bands can arise even from non-topological materials.

Conclusion: The symmetry indicator framework successfully predicts topological superlattice bands in various materials, including non-topological ones, and provides a design principle for creating topological superlattice heterostructures.

Abstract: We develop a symmetry indicator framework to efficiently predict the topology of superlattice-induced minibands with spin-orbit coupling. Our algorithm requires input only from the parent material before the superlattice is applied. The simplification arises by assuming a perturbatively weak superlattice potential; however, our results extend beyond the perturbative regime as long as the superlattice-induced gaps remain open. We first consider a time-reversal- and inversion-symmetric system subject to a weak superlattice potential and derive a compact formula for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant of the lowest miniband. We then extend to time-reversal breaking systems and compute the Chern number. We apply our theory to selected transition metal dichalcogenides, HgTe/CdTe quantum wells, and thin films of three-dimensional topological insulators and Dirac semimetals. We find topological superlattice bands can arise even from non-topological materials, broadening the pool of candidates for realizing topological flat bands. Our theory predicts which geometry and periodicity of superlattice will yield topological bands for a given material, providing a clear guiding principle for designing topological superlattice heterostructures.

Conclusion: 总结

Abstract: We present a machine learning framework to study the dynamics of entropy vectors and quantum resources, including entanglement and magic, focusing on violations of entropy inequalities. Using a reinforcement learning agent formulated as a Markov decision process, we identify quantum circuits that optimally navigate the entropy vector space to generate violations of Ingleton's inequality. We complement this approach with a classical optimization algorithm to produce arbitrary numbers of Ingleton-violating states, with tunable degrees of violation, and empirically determine the maximal attainable violation for Ingleton's inequality. Our analysis reveals characteristic patterns of quantum resources that accompany Ingleton violation. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that Ingleton-violating states occupy sharply-defined, isolated regions of the Hilbert space, and are extremely rare. Together, these results establish a unified computational toolkit for studying entropy vector dynamics, tracking quantum resource evolution, and engineering circuits with controlled information-theoretic features.

Conclusion: The report highlights niobium nano-constriction circuits as highly promising for high-field hybrid quantum systems and reveals the potential of integrating Josephson nano-diodes with microwave quantum circuits.

Abstract: The development of nonlinear and frequency-tunable superconducting microwave circuits for operation in large magnetic fields is of high relevance for hybrid quantum systems such as spin resonance spectrometers, microwave quantum magnonics, dark matter axion detectors or flux-mediated optomechanics. With these exciting perspectives in mind, we investigate niobium-based circuits with integrated nano-constriction quantum interferometers in magnetic in-plane fields up to several hundred mT. Our experiments reveal an unexpected and pronounced field-induced asymmetry in the bias-flux response of the circuits, which is demonstrated to originate from a field-induced Josephson-diode effect within the nano-constrictions and which considerably enhances the circuit figures of merit in a magnetic field. An intuitive macroscopic Josephson-diode model attributes the effect to inhomogeneous constriction properties and provides us with the diode current-phase relation as a function of the in-plane field. Finally, we demonstrate that in the diode-state the circuit Kerr nonlinearity is bimodal in frequency, not only eliminating alternative explanations for the bias-flux-asymmetries but also being potentially useful for quantum circuit applications. Overall, our report underlines that niobium nano-constriction circuits belong to the most promising candidates for high-field hybrid quantum systems and reveals the untapped potential of combining Josephson nano-diodes with microwave quantum circuits.

TL;DR: New spin-cluster method decouples specific DC fields from noise, enhancing quantum sensor capabilities for dark-matter searches and other applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum sensors face challenges due to noise obscuring desired signals; existing methods like decoupling sequences and comagnetometers have limitations in frequency bandwidth and noise handling.

Method: Utilizes spin clusters (e.g., electron-spin nuclear-spin pairs in nitrogen-vacancy centres) where target and local fields affect spins differently, enabling decoupling of specific DC fields from noise.

Result: The method significantly increases resistance to noise frequencies and demonstrates potential for applications in diverse fields including dark-matter searches.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a novel approach to decouple specific DC fields from noise, with applications in dark-matter searches, gradient sensing, quantum memory, and gyroscopes, showcasing its versatility and enhanced noise resistance.

Abstract: The excellent sensitivities of quantum sensors are a double-edged sword: minuscule quantities can be observed, but any undesired signal acts as noise. This is challenging when detecting quantities that are obscured by such noise. Decoupling sequences improve coherence times and hence sensitivities, though only AC signals in narrow frequency bands are distinguishable. Alternatively, comagnetometers operate gaseous spin mixtures at high temperatures in the self-compensating regime to counteract slowly varying noise. These are applied with great success in various exotic spin-interaction searches. Here, we propose a method that decouples specific DC fields from DC and AC magnetic noise. It requires any spin cluster where the effect on each individual spin is different for the target field and local magnetic fields, which allows for a different approach compared to comagnetometers. The presented method has several key advantages, including an orders-of-magnitude increase in noise frequencies to which we are resistant. We explore electron-spin nuclear-spin pairs in nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, with a focus on their merit for light dark-matter searches. Other applications include gradient sensing, quantum memory, and gyroscopes.

TL;DR: ARA can work in open systems if the temperature is low, and the environment may even help by creating viable paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether ARA retains its advantage in the presence of decoherence, as suggested by previous numerical simulations.

Method: Using the $p$-spin model and the adiabatic master equation to analyze the effects of the environment in ARA.

Result: ARA's success in open systems depends on temperature; it fails at high temperatures if equilibrium states are disordered or no transition-avoiding paths exist, but succeeds at low temperatures, with the environment sometimes aiding ARA.

Conclusion: ARA can succeed in open systems under certain temperature conditions, and in some cases, the environment can even benefit ARA by enabling transition-avoiding paths that do not exist at zero temperature.

Abstract: Adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) is an improvement to conventional quantum annealing (QA) that uses an initial guess at the desired ground state to circumvent problematic phase transitions. Despite encouraging results in the closed-system setting, Ref. [1] has suggested on the basis of numerical simulations that ARA may lose its advantage in the presence of decoherence. Here, we revisit this problem from a more analytical perspective. Using the $p$-spin model as a solvable example, together with the adiabatic master equation to describe the effects of the environment (valid at weak coupling), we show that ARA can in fact succeed in open systems but that the temperature of the environment plays a key role. We first demonstrate that, in the adiabatic limit, the system will follow the instantaneous equilibrium state as long as the protocol does not pass through any (finite-temperature) phase transitions. Given this, there are two distinct mechanisms by which ARA can break down at high temperature: either there are no paths that avoid transitions, or the equilibrium state itself is disordered. When the temperature is sufficiently low that neither of these occur, then ARA succeeds. Remarkably, there are even situations in which the environment benefits ARA: we find parameter values for which no transition-avoiding paths exist at zero temperature but such paths appear at non-zero temperature.

Abstract: We present quantum circuits with a brick wall structure using the optimal number of parameters and two-qubit gates to parametrize $SU(2^n)$, and provide evidence that these circuits are universal for $n\leq 5$. For this, we successfully compile random matrices to the presented circuits and show that their Jacobian has full rank almost everywhere in the domain.

We complement this numerical method by a partial proof, which hinges on an open conjecture that relates universality of an ansatz to it having full Jacobian rank almost everywhere.

TL;DR: The quantum Mpemba effect occurs in weakly open many-body systems with multiple conserved quantities or integrable Hamiltonians, evidenced by tensor network and free-fermion simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quantum Mpemba effect's conditions and its connection to the classical version remain unclear. This work aims to clarify the role of conserved quantities in enabling the effect in quantum systems.

Method: The authors employed tensor networks and free-fermion techniques to numerically simulate large system sizes, analyzing the relaxation dynamics of thermal states in open quantum systems.

Result: The Mpemba effect is feasible only when the Hamiltonian possesses multiple conserved quantities or is integrable, as the dynamics occur in higher-dimensional spaces. Numerical simulations support this claim.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the quantum Mpemba effect is closely tied to the number of conserved quantities in a system, particularly in weakly open many-body quantum systems. Integrable systems or those with multiple conserved quantities enable the effect due to higher-dimensional dynamical evolution.

Abstract: Observation of the quantum Mpemba effect has spurred much interest in its enabling conditions and its relation to the classical counterpart. Here, we consider weakly open many-body quantum systems initialized in different thermal states and examine when the initially farther state relaxes to the (non-equilibrium) steady state faster. We claim that the number of conserved quantities in the unitary part plays a crucial role: the Mpemba effect is possible only when the Hamiltonian commutes with other extensive operators or is integrable. The reason lies in the dynamical evolution happening in spaces of different dimensions. When energy is the only approximately conserved quantity, dissipation pushes the dynamics within a single-parameter manifold of different thermal states. In contrast, for Hamiltonians with several conserved quantities, the dynamics drift in the multi-dimensional space of generalized Gibbs ensembles, whose distance to the steady state is less trivial. We provide numerical results for large system sizes using tensor networks and free-fermion techniques, thereby supporting our claim.

Conclusion: The paper identifies outstanding questions and challenges in quantum network control architecture, discusses possible solutions, and highlights the need for protocol adaptations or new designs.

Abstract: The aim of a quantum network is to enable the generation of end-to-end entangled links between end nodes of the network, so that they can execute quantum network applications. To facilitate this, it is desirable to have robust control of the network in order to be able to provide a reliable service to the end nodes. In recent work arXiv:2503.12582, we proposed a modular control architecture for a generate-when-request type network. This control architecture enables quantum network applications to be executed on end nodes running a modern operating system such as QNodeOS arXiv:2407.18306. In that work, we performed an evaluation of our architecture based on a proof-of-concept implementation. In the course of performing this evaluation, we discovered many outstanding questions and challenges. These relate not only to implementing our specific control architecture, but also to the design of any quantum network control architecture. Here, we describe some outstanding questions and challenges, discuss possible solutions, and identify where existing protocols require adaptation or new protocols must be designed.

In this work, we prove several key results on the properties and complexity of Scrooge-random states in macroscopic quantum systems, and provide a general-purpose calculus for evaluating their moments.

Result: The cell operates reliably at the single-photon level, with observed performance consistent with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian formalism and limits set by flux bias, temperature, and photon number. Photon dressing induced by the qubit was observed in the high-photon regime.

Conclusion: The results establish a versatile platform for studying open quantum system phenomena and pave the way for scalable implementations of quantum routing and network nodes.

Abstract: We report the first experimental realization of a scalable basic cell for quantum routing, enabling coherent control and exchange of microwave photons between two spatially separated superconducting waveguides coupled via a single transmon qubit. The cell was characterized at 10 mK with an average input signal of approximately 1 photon at approximately 6 GHz, and with the qubit biased to its optimal point to minimize sensitivity to external magnetic fluctuations. By combining steady-state and time-domain measurements, we reconstructed the key parameters of the system, including qubit relaxation and dephasing, waveguide-qubit couplings, and cross-waveguide photon transfer efficiency. The observed performance is consistent with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian formalism and demonstrates clear limits set by flux bias, temperature, and photon number, in agreement with flux- and temperature-induced dephasing models. Crucially, the cell operates reliably at the single-photon level, and in the high-photon regime we directly observe photon dressing induced by the qubit. These results establish a versatile platform for studying open quantum system phenomena and pave the way for scalable implementations of quantum routing and network nodes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the gap in understanding efficient protocols for non-Markovian noise models in quantum simulators, which become dominant as systems scale up and noise rates decrease.

Method: The method involves preparing qubits in a product state, introducing single-qubit Clifford gates, and measuring product observables to analyze the noise characteristics.

Result: The result shows that learning non-Markovian noise is feasible with sample complexity scaling logarithmically with the system size, under specific assumptions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that under a Gaussian assumption on non-Markovian noise, it is possible to learn the noise with logarithmic sample complexity relative to the system size, using a protocol involving product states, single-qubit Clifford gates, and product observables.

Abstract: As quantum simulators are scaled up to larger system sizes and lower noise rates, non-Markovian noise channels are expected to become dominant. While provably efficient protocols for Markovian models of quantum simulators, either closed system models (described by a Hamiltonian) or open system models (described by a Lindbladian), have been developed, it remains less well understood whether similar protocols for non-Markovian models exist. In this paper, we consider geometrically local lattice models with both quantum and classical non-Markovian noise and show that, under a Gaussian assumption on the noise, we can learn the noise with sample complexity scaling logarithmically with the system size. Our protocol requires preparing the simulator qubits initially in a product state, introducing a layer of single-qubit Clifford gates and measuring product observables.

Abstract: We propose a scalable and noise-resilient protocol for the detection of the entanglement transition in a projective version of the transverse field Ising model. Entanglement transitions are experimentally difficult to observe due to the inherent randomness of projective measurements and noise in large-scale experimental settings. Our approach combines error correction algorithms with classical shadow tomography to overcome both problems. This allows for experimentally accessible upper and lower bounds on the entanglement transition without postselection or full state tomography. These bounds remain robust under noise and their sharpness is a measure of the noise rate.

Conclusion: The thesis establishes a formal connection between quantum coherence and contextuality, demonstrating their interplay through a graph-theoretic framework and uncovering new witnesses and advantages.

Abstract: In this thesis, we explore the intersection of two fundamental subfields of quantum information theory: quantum coherence and contextuality. Despite their apparent differences, both areas address key issues relevant to the foundations and applications of quantum theory. By developing a novel graph-theoretic approach, extending a framework recently introduced by Galvão and Brod (Phys. Rev.

Our key contributions include: the development of a graph-theoretic framework for generating coherence and contextuality witnesses; a formal mapping between the inequalities that follows from the work by Galvão and Brod to existing noncontextuality inequalities; the conceptualization of a relational form of quantum coherence; a proof of contextual advantage for the task of quantum interrogation; and the discovery of an infinite family of coherence witnesses that also require quantum states in Hilbert spaces of specific dimensions.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a scalable FDM-based microwave control scheme for quantum processors, addressing the challenge of increasing control lines by using a single cable for multiple qubits.

Abstract: The increasing number of qubits in quantum processors necessitates a corresponding increase in the number of control lines between the processor, which is typically operated at cryogenic temperatures, and external electronics. Scaling poses significant challenges in terms of the thermal loads, forming a major bottleneck in the realization of large-scale quantum computers. In this study, we analyze simultaneous gate operations on multiple qubits using microwaves transmitted via a single cable in a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) scheme. By employing rectangular control microwave pulses, we reveal the contribution of drive frequency spacing to gate fidelity. Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal microwave signals suppress interference in simultaneously driven qubits, thereby ensuring high gate fidelity. Additionally, we provide design guidelines for key parameters, including pulse length, number of multiplexed microwave signals, and rotation angle, to achieve precise qubit operations. Our findings enable a scalable FDM-based microwave control scheme suitable for quantum processors with a large number of qubits.

Abstract: We present a quantum-optical platform for simulating relativistic detector-field interactions using entangled nonlinear biphoton sources (ENBSs), realized through phase-controlled single-photon frequency-comb (SPFC) sources. By mapping the dynamical evolution of this system onto the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector model, we show that signal-mode excitations emulate detector transitions driven by vacuum fluctuations, while coherently seeded idler modes act as an effective quantum field. This correspondence enables tabletop exploration of Unruh-like excitation, coherence harvesting, and field-induced entanglement. We derive the effective interaction Hamiltonian and Lindblad master equation for two coherently seeded ENBS units and obtain analytical solutions for the signal photon number \(N_{\rm sig}(t)\) and second-order correlation function \(g^{(2)}(0;t)\). Numerical simulations confirm that phase-dependent biphoton dynamics reproduce UDW-type behavior, including tunable excitation and quantum correlations. The output signal state exhibits controllable fidelity, interference visibility, and entanglement entropy as functions of the seeding phase and amplitude. These results establish ENBSs as experimentally accessible quantum simulators of relativistic field phenomena, providing a photonic testbed for analog gravitational effects, vacuum fluctuations, and spacetime-induced coherence-all within reach of current nonlinear-optics technology.

Abstract: We study the phenomenon of quantum backflow in tight-binding systems with complex couplings, considering different boundary conditions and lattice sizes. Backflow is an intrinsically non-classical effect where the density flux associated with a particle described by the superposition of wave functions with, say, positive momentum, acquires negative values. We calculate the superposition of positive momentum states that gives rise to the strongest backflow in the systems. We also evaluate the bounds on the total amount of probability that flows in the opposite direction of the particle's momentum.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using a quantum nonlinear driven-dissipative mode as a quantum reservoir for characterizing optical quantum states, particularly in scenarios involving squeezed states and interactions with a degenerate optical parametric oscillator.

Abstract: Characterising optical quantum states is essential for the development of quantum technologies. While traditional approaches to perform full quantum state tomography are often experimentally demanding, neuromorphic architectures may provide an effective alternative. In this work, we demonstrate how a quantum nonlinear driven-dissipative mode is sufficient to act as a quantum reservoir. By analyzing the occupations at different frequencies in the emission spectrum, a linear regression suffices in many cases to recognize the relevant parameters of incident squeezed states. Beyond highlighting the general potential of this approach under continuous driving, we illustrate its effectiveness in an explicit nontrivial example where the source is a degenerate optical parametric oscillator (OPO), coupled to a nonlinear polariton microcavity.

Abstract: Multiplexing is essential for improving entanglement distribution rates in quantum communication. Frequency multiplexing provides a promising and scalable path toward large-capacity quantum networks. Further progress requires increasing the number of frequency modes and developing broadband photon-pair sources and quantum memories that are spectrally compatible. Here, we report the integration of a cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion source in the telecom C-band with a frequency-multiplexed atomic frequency comb memory. The bow-tie cavity source was simultaneously resonant at 606 nm and 1550 nm, generating non-degenerate photon pairs exhibiting a clustered frequency-comb spectrum. The atomic frequency comb memory, implemented in Praseodymium-doped Yttrium Orthosilicate crystals, provided up to 83 frequency modes with 123 MHz spacing and enabled broadband storage of 606 nm signal photons. By filtering the main cluster, we obtained $32.7 \pm 4.8$ effective modes, as confirmed from coincidence measurements. Importantly, we observed strong nonclassical correlations after storage, with cross-correlation values of $g_{s,i}^{(2)} = 8.1\pm0.7$. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating cavity-enhanced photon-pair sources with rare-earth-ion-doped solid-state memories. The integration reveals a high frequency multiplicity that is essential for scalable quantum networks.

Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a hotter system cools faster than a colder one under otherwise identical conditions, has been extensively studied in classical systems. In this work, we present the quantum analogue of the Mpemba effect using a dissipative qubit, which is referred to as the canonical quantum Mpemba effect. We demonstrate that, under the identical conditions, the relaxation dynamics of a qubit initialized in a thermal state with a higher temperature can be exponentially faster than those of a colder thermal state. Strikingly, this acceleration is determined solely by the initial temperature of the system, independent of other parameters. The relaxation is confirmed to be a genuine cooling process via the effective steady state temperature, mirroring its classical counterpart. Last, we propose a practical classical quantum hybrid algorithmic quantum circuit to realize this effect using superconducting qubits experimentally.

Abstract: The removal of heat generated during computation poses a major challenge for both classical and quantum information processing. In particular, heat removal is directly linked to a fundamental requirement of quantum computation: the ability to reset a system to a pure state before computation. Efficient cooling is therefore crucial both for advancing our understanding of thermodynamics in the quantum regime and for enabling the development of modern quantum technologies. In this work, we devise a cooling task that exploits steerability, a fundamental form of quantum correlations, to demonstrate a provable quantum advantage over classically correlated scenarios in which steerability is absent. We quantify this advantage by the ratio between the heat removed using steerable quantum correlations and the heat removed using unsteerable classical correlations. Specifically, we show that steerable quantum correlations always provide a thermodynamic advantage in the cooling task. Remarkably, we further establish that the maximum achievable advantage is directly related to a geometric measure of steerability known as steerability robustness. Our results suggest that this thermodynamic advantage can serve as a witness of steerability. Finally, we present examples showing that the advantage can increase with the dimension of the underlying system.

Conclusion: The proposed deterministic Bell state analysis scheme, leveraging hyperentanglement, offers a robust and practical solution for high-performance quantum information processing in photonic systems, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Bell state analysis (BSA) constitutes a foundational operation for distinguishing Bell states in numerous quantum information processing (QIP) protocols. In this work, we propose a theoretical scheme for realizing a perfect BSA tailored for polarized Bell states, with assistance from orbital angular momentum (OAM) and path entanglement. The linear-optics-based architecture for BSA circumvents the inherent limitations of nonlinear optical processes and enhances the robustness against environmental noise -- a major challenge in practical QIP implementations. The integrating hyperentanglement (combining polarization, OAM, and path degrees of freedom (DOFs)) raises the theoretical success probability to 100%, achieving deterministic BSA. This deterministic BSA scheme offers a promising route toward practical, high-performance QIP in photonic systems, leveraging current experimental techniques and addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the capability to detect gravitational redshifts in a local laboratory, paving the way for future tests of quantum phenomena within general relativistic frameworks.

Abstract: Quantum mechanics and general relativity are the foundational pillars of modern physics, yet experimental tests that combine the two frameworks remain rare. Measuring optical phase shifts of massless photons in a gravitational potential provides a unique quantum platform to probe gravity beyond Newtonian descriptions, but laboratory-based interferometers have not yet reached the sensitivity needed to access this regime. Here, we report the realization of a 50-km table-top Mach-Zehnder fiber interferometer operating at the single-photon level, achieving a phase sensitivity of $4.42\times10^{-6}$ rad root-mean-square (RMS) within the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 5 Hz. We demonstrate that this sensitivity is sufficient to resolve a phase-shift signal of $(6.18 \pm 0.44)\times10^{-5}$ rad RMS at 0.1 Hz, associated with a modulated gravity-induced signal. Our results establish a milestone for quantum sensing with large-scale optical interferometry, demonstrating the capability to detect gravitational redshifts in a local laboratory, thereby paving the way for testing quantum phenomena within general relativistic frameworks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a controllable directional single-photon source leveraging chiral cavity-magnon coupling.

Method: Utilizes a chiral cavity-magnon system with a YIG sphere coupled to rotating microwave modes in a torus-shaped microwave cavity, applying two-photon drives to achieve directional single-photon emission.

Result: Directional single-photon emission is achieved with controllable direction via biased magnetic field reversal, demonstrating robustness against nonideal factors.

Conclusion: The system retains robustness against imperfect chiral cavity-magnon coupling and inter-cavity mode coupling, preserving the unidirectional photon blockade effect.

Abstract: We propose an scheme for directional single-photon source based on a chiral cavity-magnon system. In this system, the magnon mode in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is coupled to only one of two rotating microwave modes in the torus-shaped microwave cavity. When two-photon drives are applied to both ports of the waveguide, the chiral cavity-magnon coupling leads to an unconventional photon blockade in one propagation direction, resulting in directional single-photon emission. The emission direction of the single-photon source can be controlled by reversing the biased magnetic field. Furthermore, we further examine the effects of imperfect chiral cavity-magnon coupling and the coupling between the two cavity modes on the photon blockade behavior. The results show that the system retains robustness in the presence of these nonideal factors, and the unidirectional photon blockade effect remains clearly preserved.

Abstract: Efficient atom-photon interfaces require the controlled assembly of quantum emitters, where collective effects such as superradiance and subradiance can emerge. Recent experiments with subwavelength arrays of quantum dots have observed superradiance at room temperature, revealing a delicate competition between collective enhancement of coherent emission and pure dephasing $γ^*$, which destroys it. Motivated by these results, we theoretically study $N=2$ coupled quantum emitters and identify threshold values of $γ^*$, for four experimentally accessible observables, beyond which collective effects vanish. The thresholds depend sensitively on the chosen observable, highlighting the subtlety of detecting collective behavior. Our work provides a quantitative framework to guide experiments and optimize conditions for observing collective quantum phenomena.

Method: Systematic experimental evaluation of PQC-based QRL architectures focusing on data embedding (DR), ansatz design (entanglement), and post-processing (OR), using a unified PPO-CartPole framework.

Result: Findings show Output Reuse (OR) behaves distinctly in hybrid pipelines, Data Reuploading (DR) improves trainability and stability, and stronger entanglement can degrade optimization.

Conclusion: The study provides empirical evidence on the interplay between quantum and classical components in QRL, establishing a reproducible framework for systematic benchmarking.

Abstract: Parameterised quantum circuit (PQC) based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm at the intersection of quantum computing and reinforcement learning (RL). By design, PQCs create hybrid quantum-classical models, but their practical applicability remains uncertain due to training instabilities, barren plateaus (BPs), and the difficulty of isolating the contribution of individual pipeline components. In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions. Our results show that OR, though purely classical, exhibits distinct behaviour in hybrid pipelines, that DR improves trainability and stability, and that stronger entanglement can degrade optimisation, offsetting classical gains. Together, these findings provide controlled empirical evidence of the interplay between quantum and classical contributions, and establish a reproducible framework for systematic benchmarking and component-wise analysis in QRL.

Motivation: Quantum batteries hold significant development potential, with capacity being a critical performance metric. Understanding how capacity evolves under various quantum noise channels is essential for practical applications.

Method: The research analyzes the quantum battery capacity of GHZ and GHZ-like states under Markovian channels (depolarizing, bit-phase flip, dephasing, amplitude damping) in a tripartite system. It includes studying repeated channel applications and independent same-type channels.

Result: Key findings include sudden death of capacity under depolarizing and bit-phase flip channels, frozen capacity under dephasing and amplitude damping channels, and earlier freezing onset with repeated channel applications. GHZ-like states exhibit similar behaviors.

Conclusion: The study highlights the evolution of quantum battery capacity under various Markovian channels, identifying phenomena like sudden death, frozen capacity, and the impact of repeated channel applications. GHZ and GHZ-like states exhibit distinct behaviors under different conditions, offering insights for future quantum battery design.

Abstract: Quantum battery has enormous potential for development, and quantum battery capacity is an important indicator of quantum battery. In this work, we mainly study the evolution of quantum battery capacity of GHZ state and GHZ-like states under Markovian channels in the tripartite system. We find that under the depolarizing channel and bit-phase flip channel, the battery capacity shows a brief sudden death of the capacity. And we also find that under the dephasing channel, the battery capacity gradually decreases and tends to a constant, that is, the frozen capacity. We show that the battery capacity monotonically decreases for GHZ state under the amplitude damping channel on the first subsystem. And we study the variation of capacity under the Markovian channels n times on the first subsystem using the GHZ state. We can observe that under the amplitude damping and dephasing channels, the battery capacity decreases and tends to a constant, i.e. frozen capacity, and the larger n, the earlier this phenomenon occurs. We also investigate the evolution of capacity under three independent same type Markovian channels. We have also conducted corresponding research on GHZ-like states.

Motivation: To explore the transition between weak and strong driving regimes in a cold atomic cloud and understand the collective decay dynamics.

Method: Numerical and experimental investigation of the collective early-time decay rates using angular-dependent and global observables (light emission and excited state population).

Result: The emitted light shows a transition from subradiant to superradiant behavior, while the excited state population does not exhibit superradiance.

Conclusion: The experiment demonstrates good agreement with numerical predictions in the studied parameter regime, validating the transition between subradiant and superradiant behaviors in the emitted light.

Abstract: In this work we present a numerical and experimental investigation of the collective early-time decay rates of a strongly driven and optically dense cold atomic cloud. We prepare the atomic ensemble by driving the system to its steady state with varying Rabi frequencies $Ω$ that go from the weak $Ω\ll Γ$ to the strong driving regime $Ω\gg Γ$, where $Γ$ is the single-atom decay rate. We investigate the early-time dynamics in the transition between the strong and weak driving regimes using: i) angular-dependent observables such as the light emitted by the cloud, and ii) global observables, i.e., the excited state population. When driving the cloud on-resonance, we find that as a function of the driving frequency, the behavior of the collected light at certain angles transitions from the single-photon subradiant regime to a superradiant regime while the behavior of the excited state population does not show superradiance. The experiment shows good agreement with numerical predictions in the regime of parameters under study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanism behind photonic resonance (PR) in Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) spectroscopy, which occurs despite the vanishing transition matrix element under specific detuning conditions.

Method: The research combined theoretical calculations, experimental spectroscopic measurements, analytical studies under ideal conditions, and numerical simulations including decoherence effects.

Result: The study confirmed the observation of PR in experiments, with qualitative agreement between theory and experiment. Analytical and numerical analyses showed that higher-order effects and decoherence induce Rabi oscillations, leading to PR.

Conclusion: The study successfully elucidated the physical origin of photonic resonance (PR) in KPO spectroscopy, revealing that higher-order perturbative effects and decoherence play crucial roles in the observed resonance despite the vanishing transition matrix element.

Abstract: The Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) has recently attracted considerable attention from the perspective of its applications to quantum information processing, and understanding its properties is an important challenge. Spectroscopic measurements serve as an effective means of elucidating detailed information about the system, such as the energy-level structure and the transition matrix elements of the KPO. Conventional spectroscopy requires the drive frequency to match an energy spacing with a nonzero transition matrix element. In recent years, a phenomenon called photonic resonance (PR) has been theoretically predicted in KPO spectroscopy. Specifically, resonance occurs under the condition that the detuning is set to $n/2$ times the Kerr nonlinearity, where $n$ is a natural number. However, under this condition the transition matrix element vanishes, and thus the mechanism by which photonic resonance (PR) arises has remained unclear. In this work, we aim to elucidate the physical origin of PR observed in KPO spectroscopy. We first performed theoretical calculations and experiments of spectroscopic measurements, confirming that PR can indeed be observed and that the theoretical and experimental results are in qualitative agreement. We then carried out an analytical study under the assumption of an ideal noiseless environment. Our analysis revealed that, although the transition matrix element of the external field expressed in the system's energy eigenbasis is zero, higher-order perturbative effects induce Rabi oscillations between the ground and excited states. Furthermore, numerical simulations in a time domain including the effect of decoherence demonstrated that coherent oscillations decay, leading to the appearance of PR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for experimentally feasible methods to verify genuine entanglement in large quantum systems, particularly for W-states.

Method: A class of entanglement witnesses for W-states is derived, along with an inequality to test the nonlocal nature of photon measurement backaction. Violation of these inequalities indicates genuine entanglement.

Result: The methods are shown to be experimentally accessible and robust to thermal noise, with less stringent thermal constraints for one of the derived inequalities.

Conclusion: The derived entanglement witnesses and inequalities provide experimentally accessible methods for verifying genuine entanglement in W-states, applicable to multipartite and continuous variable systems, with quantified thermal robustness.

Abstract: Entanglement between remote quantum mechanical systems enables a range of quantum information tasks in communication, computation and distributed sensing. Large numbers of entangled subsystems also require experimentally accessible and practically feasible methods of verifying the genuine, i.e., simultaneous, entanglement of all subsystems. We have derived a class of entanglement witnesses suitable for $W$-states, which are states where a single excitation is coherently distributed across subsystems initially in their ground state or a state with low thermal occupation, e.g., via detection of a Raman-scattered photon. The entanglement is witnessed through violation of an inequality involving number statistics, which can be measured via detection of subsequent Raman-scattered photons. Unlike conventional, partially tomographic, witnesses, our method is experimentally accessible for both multipartite and continuous variable systems. The thermal robustness of the method is quantified by the initial thermal occupations for which violation occurs. As an alternative approach, we have derived an inequality which tests the nonlocal, or quantum coherent, nature of the photon measurement backaction which produces the $W$-state. Violation of this alternative inequality implies the entanglement of the resulting state given the assumption of a separable initial state, under less stringent thermal constraints than the general entanglement witness. Our results are applicable to all Raman-scattering systems which can exhibit sufficient degrees of quantum indistinguishability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge posed by the recent experiment to Bohmian mechanics and clarify the misunderstandings in the experiment's claims while exploring the theoretical implications of the velocity of interest.

Method: The paper critically analyzes the experimental design and interpretation, identifying three main issues: the misidentification of stationary states, the invalidity of the proposed speed measurement method, and the misapplication of this method to time-averaged data. It also contrasts the velocity of interest with the Bohm velocity and proposes a generalized Madelung fluid model.

Result: The analysis reveals that the experiment does not convincingly challenge Bohmian mechanics due to significant methodological and interpretive flaws. It also highlights a theoretical distinction between velocities, suggesting a framework (Madelung fluid model) where the velocity of interest could have physical meaning.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the experiment's claims about Bohmian mechanics are flawed due to misinterpretations and invalid methods. However, it acknowledges a theoretical distinction between the velocity of interest and the Bohm velocity, suggesting potential for further exploration in a generalized Madelung fluid model.

Abstract: A recent experiment raises a supposed challenge to Bohmian mechanics, claiming to observe stationary states, which should have zero Bohm velocity, while indirectly measuring a nonzero speed based on how an evanescent wavefunction spreads from one waveguide to another coupled waveguide. There were numerous problems this experiment and how it was interpreted. First, the experiment is not observing stationary states as claimed, but rather the time-averaged density of wave pulses which reflect off the potential step. Second, the proposed method for measuring a propagation speed is shown to be invalid for true stationary states. Third, the invalid method was misapplied to the time-averaged density, and this is shown to have created the false impression that it yields correct speed values for stationary states. These issues notwithstanding, for a wavefunction $ψ= Re^{iS/\hbar}$, the velocity of interest, $\vec{v}_s = -\frac{\hbar}{m}\frac{\vec{\nabla}R}{R}$, is different than the Bohm velocity $\vec{v}_B=\frac{1}{m}\vec{\nabla}S$, and may be nonzero for stationary states. So, even though we do not think this experiment makes a compelling case for it, if $\vec{v}_s$ is somehow associated with real physical motion, then this motion is indeed absent from Bohmian mechanics, as the authors contend. We discuss a generalized Madelung fluid model where this velocity is given physical meaning, and show how it roughly agrees with the authors' concept of an evanescent De Broglie speed.

*Andrei Khrennikov,Karl Svozil*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to represent complex rays in real space while preserving orthogonality, showing that Kochen-Specker uncolourable configurations can admit two-valued states in the embedded form.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the representation of complex ray configurations in real space and examine the implications for Kochen-Specker uncolourable configurations.

Method: A phase-adjusted realification procedure that embeds finite sets of complex rays into a real space while preserving orthogonality conditions.

Result: The construction preserves orthogonality between rays, enabling a faithful representation, and reveals that the embedded configuration admits two-valued states despite its original uncolourability.

Conclusion: The phase-adjusted realification procedure provides a faithful orthogonal representation of complex ray configurations in higher-dimensional real space, demonstrating that some Kochen-Specker uncolourable configurations can admit two-valued states when embedded.

Abstract: We describe a phase-adjusted realification procedure that embeds any finite set of rays in $\mathbb{C}^3$ into $\mathbb{R}^6$. By assigning an appropriate phase to each ray before applying the standard coordinate-wise map, we can arrange that two rays are orthogonal in $\mathbb{C}^3$ if and only if their images are orthogonal in $\mathbb{R}^6$, so the construction yields a faithful orthogonal representation of the original complex configuration. As a concrete example, we consider the 165 projectively distinct rays used in a $\mathbb{C}^3$ Kochen-Specker configuration obtained from mutually unbiased bases, list these 165 rays explicitly in $\mathbb{C}^3$, and give for each of them its image in $\mathbb{R}^6$ under the canonical realification map. We also note that, because the original 3-element contexts are no longer maximal in $\mathbb{R}^6$, the embedded configuration admits two-valued states even though its realisation with maximal contexts in $\mathbb{C}^3$ is Kochen-Specker uncolourable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the loss of plasticity in standard deep learning models when learning from new data in dynamic, real-world environments.

Method: Demonstration of quantum learning models' plasticity across various tasks (supervised and reinforcement learning) and data modalities (classical images to quantum-native datasets). Analysis of weight and gradient growth in classical vs. quantum models.

Result: Quantum neural networks maintain consistent learning capabilities regardless of data or task, while classical models degrade due to unbounded weight and gradient growth.

Conclusion: Quantum computing in machine learning offers a robust pathway for building adaptive artificial intelligence and lifelong learners by preserving plasticity through intrinsic physical constraints.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in dynamic, real-world environments requires the capacity for continual learning. However, standard deep learning suffers from a fundamental issue: loss of plasticity, in which networks gradually lose their ability to learn from new data. Here we show that quantum learning models naturally overcome this limitation, preserving plasticity over long timescales. We demonstrate this advantage systematically across a broad spectrum of tasks from multiple learning paradigms, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning, and diverse data modalities, from classical high-dimensional images to quantum-native datasets. Although classical models exhibit performance degradation correlated with unbounded weight and gradient growth, quantum neural networks maintain consistent learning capabilities regardless of the data or task. We identify the origin of the advantage as the intrinsic physical constraints of quantum models. Unlike classical networks where unbounded weight growth leads to landscape ruggedness or saturation, the unitary constraints confine the optimization to a compact manifold. Our results suggest that the utility of quantum computing in machine learning extends beyond potential speedups, offering a robust pathway for building adaptive artificial intelligence and lifelong learners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenge of thermal noise hindering optomechanical entanglement generation, particularly in low-frequency regimes.

Method: Theoretical study of a cavity optomechanical system with three nearly equidistant optical modes in a high-finesse cavity, where the central mode is coherently driven. Radiation-pressure interactions generate quantum correlations between the sideband modes.

Result: Strong quantum correlations between the two sideband modes persist even under high thermal noise if the optical cooling rate of the mechanical mode is properly engineered.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of generating robust entanglement between optical harmonics in cavity optomechanical systems under ambient conditions, with potential applications in hybrid quantum technologies and continuous-variable quantum information processing.

Abstract: Optomechanical generation of entangled optical beams is usually hindered by thermal noise. We present a theoretical study of low frequency entanglement generation between two optical harmonics emitted from a cavity optomechanical system operating in the resolved-sideband regime. The system comprises three nearly equidistant optical modes in a high-finesse cavity, with the central mode coherently driven. This configuration enables radiation-pressure interactions that generate strong quantum correlations between the two sideband modes. Remarkably, these correlations persist even at large numbers of thermal quanta if one properly engineers the optical cooling rate of the mechanical mode. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of robust entanglement under ambient conditions, opening new avenues for hybrid quantum technologies based on mechanical interfaces and continuous-variable quantum information processing.

TL;DR: CE QAOA outperforms generic QAOA for constrained problems, offering exponential improvements for permutation constraints and potential extensions to NP-Hard problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the intrinsic feasibility bottleneck of the generic QAOA in constrained optimization problems, aiming to achieve exponential improvements through constraint embedding.

Method: The study analyzes the limitations of generic QAOA on constrained problems, introduces a constraint-enhanced kernel (CE QAOA) operating in a product one hot subspace with a block local XY Hamiltonian, and provides theoretical proofs of its performance.

Result: CE QAOA achieves a provable, exponential enhancement over generic QAOA in terms of feasible mass for permutation constrained problems, with the improvement growing exponentially in n² for depths up to a linear fraction of n.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that the constraint-enhanced kernel (CE QAOA) offers an exponential improvement over the standard generic QAOA for constrained optimization problems, particularly those with permutation constraints, and suggests broader applicability to NP-Hard problems.

Abstract: We study fundamental limitations of the generic Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on constrained problems where valid solutions form a low dimensional manifold inside the Boolean hypercube, and we present a provable route to exponential improvements via constraint embedding. Focusing on permutation constrained objectives, we show that the standard generic QAOA ansatz, with a transverse field mixer and diagonal r local cost, faces an intrinsic feasibility bottleneck: even after angle optimization, circuits whose depth grows at most linearly with n cannot raise the total probability mass on the feasible manifold much above the uniform baseline suppressed by the size of the full Hilber space. Against this envelope we introduce a minimal constraint enhanced kernel (CE QAOA) that operates directly inside a product one hot subspace and mixes with a block local XY Hamiltonian. For permutation constrained problems, we prove an angle robust, depth matched exponential enhancement where the ratio between the feasible mass from CE QAOA and generic QAOA grows exponentially in $n^2$ for all depths up to a linear fraction of n, under a mild polynomial growth condition on the interaction hypergraph. Thanks to the problem algorithm co design in the kernel construction, the techniques and guarantees extend beyond permutations to a broad class of NP-Hard constrained optimization problems.

*Johan F. Triana,Felipe Herrera*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Infrared nanocavities reduce the laser energy needed for photodissociation of a CS₂ molecule, with a strong quantum mechanical enhancement when photons are injected into the cavity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand how chemical reactions, particularly bond breaking, proceed in exotic coupling regimes of cavity QED with a few molecules. This addresses a gap in knowledge regarding the behavior of molecules in infrared nanocavities under strong laser fields.

Method: The researchers investigated the photodissociation of a single CS₂ molecule under strong coupling with an infrared vacuum field and resonant laser driving. They compared dissociation under direct vibrational mode driving versus cavity photon injection, analyzing the intensities required and the quantum mechanical dynamics.

Result: Photodissociation intensities are significantly lower inside the cavity than in free space, with a two-order-of-magnitude reduction when photons are injected into the cavity compared to direct vibrational mode driving. The effect arises from quantum mechanical dynamics involving vacuum-induced admixing of vibrational states and the cavity field acting as a surrogate molecular mode.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that infrared nanocavities significantly reduce the laser energy required for photodissociation of a single CS₂ molecule, with a two-order-of-magnitude enhancement when photons are injected into the cavity compared to direct vibrational mode driving. This effect, rooted in quantum mechanics, highlights the potential for designing novel nanophotonics experiments to probe single-molecule chemistry.

Abstract: Controlling bond breaking is a long-standing goal in molecular physics. Infrared nanocavities are currently being developed for reaching exotic coupling regimes of cavity QED with a few molecules, but it is not well understood how chemical reactions would proceed in such systems. To address this, we study infrared laser photodissociation of a single CS$_{2}$ molecule with a stretching mode that strongly interacts with a resonant infrared vacuum, subject to a strong laser field that either resonantly drives the molecule at its fundamental vibration frequency or injects photons at the cavity resonance. We show that the intensities required for photodissociation are significantly lower inside the cavity than in free space, with a strong dependence on the type of driving condition. By directly injecting photons into the cavity, the molecule dissociates with two orders of magnitude less laser energy than by directly driving the vibrational mode. This photodissociation enhancement is a purely quantum mechanical effect that cannot be captured semi-classically. The intracavity ladder climbing dynamics is substantially modified relative to free space due to vacuum-induced admixing a large number of vibrational quantum numbers and the cavity field acting as a surrogate molecular mode that strongly interacts with the dissociative vibrational motion. Our work provides fundamental mechanistic understanding of chemical dynamics that can be used for designing new types of nanophotonics experiments that probe single-molecule chemistry.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how indefinite causal order (ICO) can enhance thermodynamic processes, particularly the heating or cooling of a two-level system interacting with thermal baths, and to understand the role of quantum coherence in these processes.

Method: The authors investigated the impact of ICO on thermodynamic processes by considering a two-level system interacting with two thermal baths under a quantum SWITCH. They derived closed-form expressions for the effective inverse temperature of the postselected system state for both identical and distinct bath temperatures.

Result: The analysis reveals how the diagonal and coherent components of the control-qubit state contribute to temperature shifts, enabling departures from thermal responses attainable under fixed causal order. Bath asymmetry enhances these effects, while reduced purity of the control qubit state suppresses them.

Conclusion: The study provides a systematic framework for assessing the thermodynamic capabilities of indefinite causal order (ICO) and clarifies the role of quantum coherence as a tunable thermodynamic resource. It highlights how bath asymmetry enhances thermodynamic effects, while reduced purity of the control qubit state suppresses them.

Abstract: Indefinite causal order (ICO), in which the order of quantum operations is placed in a coherent superposition, has been demonstrated to enhance various information-processing tasks. Here, we investigate its impact on the thermodynamic processes generated by thermalizing quantum channels. We consider a two-level system interacting with two thermal baths under a quantum SWITCH, with the channel order controlled coherently by an ancillary qubit. We derive closed-form expressions for the effective inverse temperature $β_f$ of the postselected system state for both identical and distinct bath temperatures, and identify the control-qubit parameters that maximize heating or cooling. Our analysis reveals how the diagonal and coherent components of the control-qubit state contribute separately to the temperature shift, and how their interplay enables departures from the thermal response attainable under any fixed causal order. Bath asymmetry enhances these effects, while reduced purity of the control qubit state suppresses them. These results provide a systematic framework for assessing the thermodynamic capabilities of ICO and clarify the role of quantum coherence as a tunable thermodynamic resource.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between classical masked autoencoders and quantum computing by introducing a quantum version that leverages quantum states for feature learning.

Method: Designed quantum masked autoencoders (QMAEs) to learn missing features of data samples within quantum states, with validation on MNIST images.

Result: QMAEs outperform state-of-the-art quantum autoencoders by 12.86% on average in classification accuracy with masked data.

Conclusion: The proposed QMAE architecture successfully extends classical masked autoencoders to the quantum domain, demonstrating improved performance in feature learning and classification accuracy.

Abstract: Classical autoencoders are widely used to learn features of input data. To improve the feature learning, classical masked autoencoders extend classical autoencoders to learn the features of the original input sample in the presence of masked-out data. While quantum autoencoders exist, there is no design and implementation of quantum masked autoencoders that can leverage the benefits of quantum computing and quantum autoencoders. In this paper, we propose quantum masked autoencoders (QMAEs) that can effectively learn missing features of a data sample within quantum states instead of classical embeddings. We showcase that our QMAE architecture can learn the masked features of an image and can reconstruct the masked input image with improved visual fidelity in MNIST images. Experimental evaluation highlights that QMAE can significantly outperform (12.86% on average) in classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art quantum autoencoders in the presence of masks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore how structured light, specifically vector vortex beams, interacts with atomic media, focusing on the mapping of orbital angular momentum onto atomic coherence and the resulting optical effects.

Method: The paper investigates the propagation of an optical vector vortex in a three-level Λ configuration atomic medium (phaseonium), analyzing the interaction between vortex pulse pairs with opposite spin and orbital angular momenta.

Result: The medium maps the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the vortex pairs onto spatially structured atomic coherence, producing azimuthal transparency structures and reshaping the beam intensity. Optical spin-orbit coupling leads to SAM exchange, polarization rotation, and dynamic polarization state evolution.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the propagation of an optical vector vortex through a coherently prepared atomic medium results in the medium inheriting the vortex pair's topology, leading to structured atomic coherence and optical anisotropy. This process induces optical spin-orbit coupling and dynamic polarization state evolution.

Abstract: We investigate the propagation of an optical vector vortex weakly interacting with a coherently prepared atomic medium (phaseonium) in a three-level $Λ$ configuration. The vector beam consists of vortex pulse pairs with right- and left-circular polarizations, corresponding to opposite spin angular momentum (SAM), and carrying opposite orbital angular momentum (OAM) charges $\pm l$. We show that during the propagation of the vortex pairs, analytically obtained in the linear regime, the medium inherits the topology of the vortex pair, mapping the OAM onto a spatially structured atomic coherence. This mapping produces $2|l|-$fold azimuthal transparency structures that reshape the beam intensity from a ring into a petal-like pattern. The OAM-structured atomic coherence induces a corresponding optical anisotropy within the medium, which feeds back into the propagating vector beam, resulting in optical spin-orbit coupling manifested as SAM exchange, rotation, and evolution of polarization textures. Depending on the initial ground-state population of the phaseonium, the polarization state evolves between left-circular, linear, and right-circular polarizations.

Result: The algorithm performs successfully on random Hamiltonians (2-3 qubits) and many-body systems (up to 6 qubits), identifying eigenstates and hidden symmetries.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning algorithm successfully identifies fixed points of quantum operations, including Hamiltonian eigenstates, and can reveal hidden symmetries in many-body systems, with potential for post-selection of high-fidelity states.

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to identify the fixed points of a given quantum operation. The method iteratively constructs the unitary transformation that maps the computational basis onto the basis of fixed points through a reward-penalty scheme based on quantum measurements. In cases where the operation corresponds to a Hamiltonian evolution, this task reduces to determining the Hamiltonian eigenstates. The algorithm is first benchmarked on random Hamiltonians acting on two and three qubits and then applied to many-body systems of up to six qubits, including the transverse-field Ising model and the all-to-all pairing Hamiltonian. In both cases, the algorithm is demonstrated to perform successfully; in the pairing model, it can also reveal hidden symmetries, which can be exploited to restrict learning to specific symmetry sectors. Finally, we discuss the possibility of post-selecting high-fidelity states even when full convergence has not been reached.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simulate quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems using near-term quantum devices by leveraging translational invariance and symmetries of the Hamiltonian.

Method: The framework uses a translationally symmetric variational ansatz with a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) circuit and a Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) circuit to evolve free-fermion states to interacting system states. VQE is benchmarked on the XXZ Hamiltonian.

Result: Numerical results show accurate capture of low-lying excitation spectra and renormalized quasiparticle velocities, verified against Bethe ansatz theoretical results.

Conclusion: The proposed momentum-space VQE framework effectively captures the low-lying excitation spectrum of quasiparticles in the XXZ model, with renormalized velocities matching theoretical predictions. The method is extensible to other interacting quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: We propose a momentum-space based variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework for simulating quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum devices. Leveraging translational invariance and other symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we reconstruct the momentum-resolved quasiparticle excitation spectrum through targeted simulation of low-lying excited states using VQE. We construct a translationally symmetric variational ansatz designed to evolve a free-fermion particle-hole excited state with definite momentum $q$ to an excited state of the interacting system at the same momentum, employing a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) circuit coupled to a Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) circuit. Even though the particle number is not explicitly conserved in the variational ansatz, the correct quasiparticle state is reached by energetic optimization. We benchmark the performance of the proposed VQE implementation on the XXZ Hamiltonian, which maps onto the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the fermionic representation. Our numerical results show that VQE can capture the low-lying excitation spectrum of the bosonic quasiparticle/two-spinon dispersion of this model at various interaction strengths. We estimate the renormalized velocity of the quasiparticles by calculating the slope of the dispersion near zero momentum using the VQE-optimized energies at different system sizes, and demonstrate that it closely matches theoretical results obtained from Bethe ansatz. Finally, we highlight extensions of our proposed VQE implementation to simulate quasiparticles in other interacting quantum many-body systems.

TL;DR: CFT explains how excited states in 1D critical systems can be derived from ground-state Schmidt vectors, predicting an entanglement-spectrum transition confirmed by numerical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To elucidate the theoretical mechanism behind the successful numerical method of accessing excited states in one-dimensional critical systems through the ground state and local effective Hamiltonian.

Method: The method involves constructing a local effective Hamiltonian from the ground state obtained via variational MPS optimization and using a truncated basis of ground-state Schmidt vectors to represent excited states, with CFT correlation functions analyzing their contributions.

Result: The CFT analysis reveals that the contribution of Schmidt vectors decays with increasing index and predicts an entanglement-spectrum transition. Numerical results confirm this reorganization into distinct conformal towers.

Conclusion: The study provides a CFT perspective to explain the mechanism of constructing excited states from ground-state Schmidt vectors in one-dimensional critical systems, supported by numerical results showing an entanglement-spectrum transition.

Abstract: Solving excited states is a challenging task for interacting systems. For one-dimensional critical systems, however, excited states can be directly accessed from the eigenvectors of the local effective Hamiltonian that is constructed from the ground state obtained by variational matrix product state (MPS) optimization. Despite its numerical success, the theoretical mechanism underlying this method has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a conformal field theory (CFT) perspective that helps elucidate this connection. The key insight is that this construction effectively uses a truncated basis of ground-state Schmidt vectors to represent excited states, where the contribution of each Schmidt vector can be expressed as a CFT correlation function and shown to decay with increasing Schmidt index. The CFT analysis further predicts an entanglement-spectrum transition of excited states as the ratio of the subsystem size to the total system size is varied. Our numerical results support this picture and demonstrate a reorganization of the entanglement spectrum into distinct conformal towers as this ratio changes.

Motivation: To understand the behavior of topological quantum fluids under slow perturbations and investigate deviations from the expected universal behavior in the presence of strong long-range interactions.

Method: The study analyzes the temporal behavior of topological quantum fluids with strong long-range couplings under slow external perturbations, specifically when the rate approaches the quasi-static limit.

Result: When the drive is terminated at the edge of the topological non-trivial phase, the number of generated excitations becomes extensive, breaking the usual adiabatic scaling (n_exc ∝ δ²) observed in local systems.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a novel mechanism for the breakdown of adiabaticity in fermionic systems with strong long-range interactions, fundamentally breaking the established universal behavior observed in local topological quantum fluids.

Abstract: We study the temporal behavior of topological quantum fluids with strong long-range couplings under slow external perturbations, whose rate $δ$ approaches the quasi-static limit $δ\to 0$. As expected, due to strong long-range interactions, the system lies in the mean-field universality and the density of defects for drives across the quantum critical point is adiabatic $n_{\rm exc}\propto δ^{2}$. However, if the drive is instead terminated precisely at the edge of the topological non-trivial phase, the number of generated excitations becomes extensive $n_{\rm exc}\propto O(1)$. This result fundamentally breaks the established universal behavior observed in local topological quantum fluids and demonstrates a novel mechanism for the breakdown of adiabaticity in fermionic systems with strong long-range interactions.

Abstract: Transport due to electrons in ultra-clean two dimensional systems can be hydrodynamic in nature with the momentum of the electrons being conserved in the bulk. This hydrodynamic behavior coupled with effects of Berry curvature arising from band structure can give rise to novel vortical transport coefficients relating the stress tensor to gradients in the electrostatic potential and temperature. These coefficients have been calculated in the absence of a magnetic field and have been shown to depend only on the equilibrium distribution function~\cite{Chadha_Mukerjee2024}. In this paper, we first obtain an expression for the viscosity tensor and show that the Berry curvature generates odd components of the viscosity tensor arising from the intrinsic angular momentum of the Bloch wavepackets. We calculate the viscosity tensor for a two-dimensional microscopic model of tilted Dirac cones. We next obtain the vortical coefficients and the viscosity tensor in the presence of a magnetic field and extend the Onsager relations for them to include both the magnetic field and the Berry curvature. We show that the field dependence of the coefficients manifests itself in the non-equilibrium part of the distribution function and calculate them to second order in the electron-electron scattering time. We explicitly show that the expressions we obtain are consistent with the Onsager relations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the behavior of quantum spin liquids on quasicrystals, specifically focusing on the stabilization of gapped ground states and the emergence of anomalous localization properties.

Method: The authors analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model, use perturbative magnetic fields, and conduct numerical studies to uncover localization mechanisms.

Result: The model exhibits a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants, anomalous anyonic excitation delocalization, and strictly localized eigenstates due to background flux configurations and quasicrystal geometry.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that topologically ordered phases with geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges, particularly in quasicrystal-based models.

Abstract: An exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid on a quasicrystal, akin to Kitaev's honeycomb model, was introduced in Kim \textit{et al.}, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.214438}{\text{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using STM and ESR to detect localized spins in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain, supported by DMRG calculations and analytical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to probe correlations in topological phases by studying boundary excitations, particularly localized spins at the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain, and to propose a practical experimental method for their detection.

Method: The paper uses scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR) to detect localized spins. Density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is employed to calculate spin gaps and spin projections for chains of varying lengths and interaction strengths. Analytical expressions are derived for the non-interacting limit.

Result: The results show that the STM tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, leading to a Kondo peak at low bias. Spatial resolution of the Kondo resonance width provides a signature of localized spins. The DMRG calculations and analytical results validate the proposal.

Conclusion: The study concludes that detecting localized spins at the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain using STM and ESR is feasible, with the Kondo resonance providing a clear signature. The DMRG calculations and analytical results support this proposal, highlighting the role of boundary zeros in characterizing the correlated phase.

Abstract: Studying boundary excitations provides a powerful approach to probe correlations in topological phases. We propose that localized spins near the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain embedded in an insulating environment can be detected experimentally using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR). When the STM tip is in the contact regime, the tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, giving rise to a Kondo peak at low bias. Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides an indirect yet clear signature of these localized spins. To support this proposal, we use density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to calculate the spin gap and spin projection of end states for chains of various lengths and interaction strengths $U$ at half-filling. In the non-interacting limit ($U=0$), we derive simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for sufficiently long chains. We also discuss how the correlated phase of the isolated chain is characterized by boundary zeros in its single-particle Green's function, and briefly comment on their localization properties in relation to the boundary spins.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子多体疤痕态是违反本征态热化假设的特殊本征态，即使在有限能量密度下也能与热化本征态共存。研究其在典型微扰下的稳定性有助于理解弱遍历性破坏的机制。

Method: 通过微扰理论和有限尺寸标度分析研究了XY自旋链中U(1)对称性保持微扰对量子多体疤痕态稳定性的影响。

Result: 研究表明，尽管疤痕态在小型系统中可以通过微扰理论描述，但在较大系统中会热化；与疤痕态相关的长程序在微扰下衰减，且某些局部观测量振荡动态的弛豫时间尺度与微扰强度的平方成反比。

Conclusion: 尽管在较小系统尺寸下微扰理论可以描述受扰动的量子多体疤痕态，但有限尺寸标度分析表明在较大链中这些疤痕态最终会热化。然而，与疤痕态相关的长程序在微扰下衰减，我们估计某些局部可观测量振荡动态的弛豫时间尺度为$λ^{-2}$，其中$λ$为微扰强度。

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbations in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicates that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $λ^{-2}$, where $λ$ is the perturbation strength.

TL;DR: NMR and QMC reveal 2D BKT-type fluctuations in Ba$_2$CuSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$, confirming it as a model system for quantum magnet dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the spin dynamics and critical fluctuations in Ba$_2$CuSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$, a quasi-2D spin-$1/2$ dimer compound exhibiting a magnetic field-induced Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of triplons.

Method: Combined nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin-lattice relaxation rate ($T_1^{-1}$) measurements and large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations.

Result: A pronounced peak in $T_1^{-1}$ above the Néel temperature $T_N$ indicates strong 2D BKT-type fluctuations, with critical exponents consistent with 2D universality. The BEC phase boundaries match quantitatively between experiment and theory, validating an effective XXZ model.

Conclusion: Ba$_2$CuSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$ is established as a model system for studying BKT dynamics in quantum magnets, with a nearly field-independent $T_{\mathrm{BKT}}/T_N \approx 0.74$.

Abstract: We study the spin dynamics in the quasi-2D spin-$1/2$ dimer compound Ba$_2$CuSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$, which exhibits a magnetic field-induced Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of triplons. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin-lattice relaxation rate ($T_1^{-1}$) measurements combined with large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we investigate critical fluctuations across the field-temperature phase diagram. Bridging the behavior observed in 1D and 3D systems, the $T_1^{-1}$ relaxation rate shows a pronounced peak extending well above the Néel temperature $T_N$, indicating strong two-dimensional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-type fluctuations. A quantitative match between experimental and theoretical BEC phase boundaries validates an effective XXZ model. The study determines the intrinsic BKT transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{BKT}}$ from QMC, revealing a nearly field-independent $T_{\mathrm{BKT}}/T_N \approx 0.74$. Scaling analysis of the relaxation rate shows critical exponents consistent with 2D universality, and a narrow temperature window is identified where 2D physics dominates. These findings establish Ba$_2$CuSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$ as a model system for exploring BKT dynamics in quantum magnets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying experimental signatures of anyons and extending previous theoretical work on linear response spectroscopy to reveal fractional exchange statistics in nonlinear settings.

Method: Analysis of time-ordered four-point correlation functions and numerical simulations validating the approach with Abelian anyons in the toric code and non-Abelian Ising anyons.

Result: The threshold behavior of nonlinear response functions encodes the fractional statistics between general pairs of anyons, enabling unambiguous distinction of non-Abelian anyons.

Conclusion: The study successfully extends the framework of linear response spectroscopy to nonlinear, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy, providing a method to identify fractional statistics between general pairs of anyons, including non-Abelian anyons.

Abstract: Identifying experimental signatures of anyons, which exhibit fractional exchange statistics, remains a central challenge in the study of two-dimensional topologically ordered systems. Previous theoretical work has shown that the threshold behavior in linear response spectroscopy can reveal the fractional exchange statistics between an anyon and its antiparticle. In this work, we extend this framework to nonlinear, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy. We demonstrate by analyzing time-ordered four-point correlation functions that the threshold behavior of nonlinear response functions encodes the fractional statistics between general pairs of anyons that can combine to any composite topological charge. This feature in particular provides a powerful probe for unambiguously distinguishing non-Abelian anyons, which can form multiple composite charges with distinct nontrivial braid statistics. Our approach is validated using numerical simulations that are consistent with the correct fractional exchange statistics for both the Abelian anyons in the toric code and non-Abelian Ising anyons.

TL;DR: Analytical study of zero-temperature spherical model with non-reciprocal interactions shows exponential decay dynamics and oscillatory regimes, contrasting with power-law relaxation in symmetric cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the dynamics of the spherical model with non-reciprocal interactions and understand how non-reciprocity affects time-translation invariance and equilibrium at long times.

Method: The researchers analytically solve the zero-temperature dynamics of the spherical model with non-reciprocal random interactions from the real elliptic ensemble of random matrices, varying the parameter η to study transitions between symmetric and antisymmetric couplings.

Result: The two-time correlation and response functions depend on both times due to non-reciprocal interactions, leading to exponential decays in long-time relaxation instead of power-law relaxation. For antisymmetric correlations (η < 0), a transition to an oscillatory regime occurs beyond a time scale τ(η), with periodic oscillations and exponentially decaying amplitudes.

Conclusion: The study provides a detailed account of the dynamics of the spherical model with non-reciprocal interactions at zero temperature, serving as a benchmark for understanding complex systems with nonlinear and asymmetric interactions.

Abstract: We analytically solve the zero-temperature dynamics of the spherical model with non-reciprocal random interactions drawn from the real elliptic ensemble of random matrices, where a single parameter $η$ continuously interpolates between purely symmetric ($η=1$) and purely antisymmetric ($η=-1$) couplings. We show that the two-time correlation and response functions depend on both times in the presence of non-reciprocal interactions, reflecting the breakdown of time-translation invariance and the absence of equilibrium at long times. Nevertheless, the long-time relaxation of the two-time observables is governed by exponential decays, in contrast to the slow, power-law relaxation characteristic of the model with purely symmetric interactions. We further show that, when the interactions present antisymmetric correlations of strength $η<0$, there is a time scale $τ(η)$ above which the dynamics undergoes a transition to an oscillatory regime where the two-time observables display periodic oscillations with an exponentially decaying amplitude. Overall, our results give a detailed account of the dynamics of the spherical model with non-reciprocal interactions at zero temperature, providing a benchmark for the study of complex systems with nonlinear and asymmetric interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional QUBO-based methods for solving QUIO and HUIO problems increase computational complexity, prompting the need for a direct SA approach.

Method: The study introduces a framework for directly applying SA to QUIO and HUIO problems without binary encoding, featuring an optimal-transition Metropolis method to enhance efficiency.

Result: Numerical experiments show the direct SA approach with the optimal-transition Metropolis method improves efficiency and solution quality compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed direct approach to QUIO and HUIO problems using SA, combined with the optimal-transition Metropolis method, outperforms conventional QUBO-based formulations, offering higher efficiency and solution quality.

Abstract: Simulated annealing (SA) is a key algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems, which model numerous real-world systems. While SA is commonly used to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, many practical problems are more naturally formulated using integer variables. We therefore study quadratic and higher-order unconstrained integer optimization (QUIO and HUIO) problems, which generalize QUBO by allowing integer-valued variables and higher-order interactions. Conventional approaches often convert these problems into QUBO formulations through binary encoding and the reduction of higher-order terms. Such conversions, however, greatly increase the number of variables and interactions, resulting in long computation times and, for large-scale problems, even making the conversion itself a dominant computational bottleneck. To overcome this limitation, we propose an efficient framework that directly applies SA to QUIO and HUIO problems without converting them into QUBO. Within this framework, we introduce an optimal-transition Metropolis method, designed to improve efficiency when the variable bounds are wide, and evaluate its performance alongside the conventional Metropolis and heat bath methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed direct approach achieves higher efficiency and solution quality than the conventional QUBO-based formulation and reveal the practical advantages of the optimal-transition Metropolis method. The algorithm developed in this study is available as part of the open-source library OpenJij, which provides a Python interface with a C++ backend.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the magnetic, thermodynamic, and magnetocaloric properties of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedral chain with distinct exchange interactions under an external magnetic field.

Method: Variational method, extended localized-magnon approach, and exact diagonalization are employed to investigate the spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedral chain with three distinct exchange interactions in an external magnetic field.

Result: Two distinct fragmented phases are identified in the frustrated regime: one with collective plaquette singlets and the other with dimer singlets. The study also reveals low-temperature magnetization curves with plateaus and field-driven transitions with double-peak specific heat structures.

Conclusion: The system supports highly efficient cooling via adiabatic demagnetization, making it a promising candidate for magnetocaloric refrigeration.

Abstract: Magnetic, thermodynamic, and magnetocaloric properties of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg octahedral chain with three distinct exchange interactions are investigated in an external magnetic field using the variational method, extended localized-magnon approach, and exact diagonalization. Variational arguments rigorously establish two distinct fragmented phases in the frustrated regime. In the former phase all four spins of each square plaquette form a collective plaquette singlet, whereas in the latter phase two dimer singlets are formed along diagonals of each square plaquette. These bound two-magnon states, supplemented with three localized one-magnon states, enable us to elaborate a generalized localized-magnon theory that is applicable in a frustrated regime across the entire field range as confirmed by comparison with exact diagonalization data. The concept of localized magnons provides a consistent description of low-temperature magnetization curves featuring intermediate one-fifth and three-fifths plateaus, which intersect each other at temperature-independent crossing points determined by the relative degeneracies of competing bound-magnon phases. Field variations of the specific heat reveal a pronounced double-peak structure near each field-driven transition with peak heights depending on the relative degeneracies of the respective bound-magnon states. Our results demonstrate that the system supports highly efficient cooling via adiabatic demagnetization, making it a promising candidate for magnetocaloric refrigeration.

TL;DR: Adding temperature-dependent attraction to a cell model with competing interactions introduces a triple point without losing exact solvability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how temperature-dependent interactions alter the phase behavior of a many-particle system with competing global attraction and short-range repulsion.

Method: Studied a cell fluid model with Curie-Weiss-type interaction potential, analyzing the effects of temperature-dependent attractive interactions.

Result: The modified model exhibits a triple point in the phase diagram while maintaining exact solvability.

Conclusion: Incorporating temperature-dependent attractive interactions in the cell model preserves its exact solvability and introduces a triple point in the phase diagram.

Abstract: We study a cell fluid model of a many-particle system with Curie-Weiss-type interaction potential. It is considered as an open system in a fixed volume partitioned into a large number of congruent cubic cells. The interaction potential comprises two competing components: a global uniform attraction acting between all particle pairs in the volume and a short-range repulsion between particles occupying the same cell. Previous studies have established that this model admits an exact solution, exhibits multiple critical points, and undergoes a sequence of first-order phase transitions. Despite variations in the interaction strengths, no triple point appears as long as these parameters remain fixed. We demonstrate that incorporating effective {temperature-dependent} attractive interactions fundamentally alters the phase behavior of the cell model. This modification preserves the model's exact solvability while resulting in the emergence of a triple point in the phase diagram.
