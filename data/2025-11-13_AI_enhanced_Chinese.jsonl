However, its performance is critically dependent on the selection of the circuit depth a parameter that must be specified a priori without clear guidance. In this paper, we introduce a variant of QAOA called dynamic depth Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (DDQAOA) that resolves the challenge of pre selecting a fixed circuit depth. Our method adaptively expands circuit depth, starting from p = 1 and progressing up to p = 10, by transferring learned parameters to deeper circuits based on convergence criteria. We tested this approach on 100 instances of the Constrained Shortest Path Problem (CSPP) at 10 qubit and 16 qubit scales. Our DDQAOA achieved superior approximation ratios and success probabilities with fewer CNOT gate evaluations than the standard QAOA for p = 3, 5, 10, and 15. In particular, while standard QAOA at p = 15 achieved results close to our approach, it used 217% and 159.3% more CNOT gates for 10 qubit and 16 qubit instances, respectively.

To address this, we develop a random Hamiltonian approach where the molecular $g$-tensor fluctuates due to classical lattice motion obtained from molecular dynamics simulations at constant temperature. Atomistic $g$-tensor fluctuations are used to construct Redfield quantum master equations that predict the relaxation $T_1$ and dephasing $T_2$ times of copper porphyrin qubits in a crystalline framework. Assuming one-phonon spin-lattice interaction processes, $1/T$ temperature scaling and $1/B^3$ magnetic field scaling of $T_1$ are established using atomistic bath correlation functions. Atomistic $T_1$ predictions overestimate the available experimental data by orders of magnitude.

We find that the average sign develops a negative peak near the critical point, but it is not a unique indicator of phase transition, as similar features can appear in non-critical regions. While the average modified sign provides a viable probe for the phase transition, the practical effectiveness of this method is limited by the exponential scaling of computational cost with the system's volume.

Rev. X 3, 041003 (2013)] to a more general setting for studying the thermodynamics of information processing including initial correlations, we generalize the second law of thermodynamics to account for information processing in such autonomous systems. We consider a composite quantum system consisting of a principal system, heat bath, memory, and work source, and adopt an autonomous Hamiltonian framework. We derive constraints on the total Hamiltonian that ensure the work source to act as a catalyst preserving its original randomness, namely that the total unitary evolution must have a unitary partial transpose. We show that this requirement is equivalent to the commutativity of operators acting on the joint system of the principal system, bath, and memory, which underlies the Hamiltonian structure.

However, conventional schemes that focus on directly using gravity to induce entanglement suffer from overwhelming environmental decoherence: maintaining entanglement between two oscillators requires an impractically high mechanical quality factor. In this work, we put forward an alternative reservoir-engineered scheme, whose core function is to quantify how gravity modifies (rather than prepares) the steady-state entanglement. Compared to quantum gravity, classical gravity introduces additional dissipative channels, which in turn give rise to distinct entanglement characteristics and thus enable the discrimination between the two types of gravity. Notably, this entanglement difference can still be maintained even when the mechanical quality factor is far below the threshold required by conventional schemes.

In nanophotonics, a promising platform for quantum technologies, entanglement generation via plasmon-mediated coupling in quantum dot qubits is often modeled within the dipole limit, where only dipolar plasmons of the mediating nanoparticle are considered, and the local response approximation, where nonlocal corrections are ignored. However, multipolar effects manifest strongly at coupling distances less than the nanoparticle size, while nonlocal optical effects stem from a size-induced dielectric response. We investigated these two important effects in the generation of two-qubit entanglement mediated by plasmonic coupling. A cavity quantum electrodynamic approach is employed, where the induced plasmonic effects lead to modified transition rates in the dynamics of the coupled quantum dot qubits.
