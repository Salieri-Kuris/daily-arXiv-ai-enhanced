Abstract: In Ref. [1], arXiv:2511.03384, Markos and Hlubina argue that "contrary to the expectations of Hirsch" [2] the conventional theory of superconductivity correctly describes the dynamics of the Meissner effect. Here I point out the flaws in their arguments that render them invalid, and propose an experiment to shed further light on these issues.

Abstract: We report the experimental discovery of bulk superconductivity in two kagome lattice compounds, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$, which were predicted through machine learning-accelerated high-throughput screening combined with first principles calculations. These materials crystallize in the hexagonal CeCo$_3$B$_2$-type structure with planar kagome networks formed by Ru atoms. We observe superconducting critical temperatures of $T_{c} = 0.81$~K for YRu$_3$B$_2$ and $T_{c} = 0.95$~K for LuRu$_3$B$_2$, confirmed through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Both compounds exhibit nearly 100\% superconducting volume fractions, demonstrating bulk superconductivity. Compared with LaRu$_3$Si$_2$, YRu$_3$B$_2$ and LuRu$_3$B$_2$ show a more dispersive Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ quasi-flat band (and thus a reduced DOS at $E_F$) together with an overall hardening of the phonon spectrum, both of which lower the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) constant $λ$. Meanwhile, the dominant real-space EPC between Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states and the low-frequency Ru in-plane local $x$ branch remains nearly unchanged, indicating that the reduction of $λ$ originates from the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ DOS reduction and the overall phonon hardening. Superfluid weight calculations show that conventional contributions dominate over quantum geometric effects due to the dispersive nature of bands near the Fermi level. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating machine learning screening, first principles theory, and experimental synthesis for accelerating the discovery of new superconducting materials.

Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs), devices consisting of two superconductors separated by a barrier, are of great technological importance, being a cornerstone of quantum information processing. Classical understanding of superconductor-insulator-superconductor JJs is that conventional insulator's properties, other than magnetism, do not significantly influence the junction's behavior. However, recent work on quantum material (QM) JJs - using Mott insulator Nb3Br8 - resulted in magnetic field-free non-reciprocal superconductivity, termed the Josephson diode effect (JDE), implying the QM's intrinsic properties can modulate superconductivity in non-trivial ways. To date, the underlying mechanism and dependence of the JDE on correlation strength (U/t) has not been elucidated. Here we fabricate QMJJs using correlated Kagome insulators with varying U/t, Nb3X8 (X=Cl, Br, I), observing a decreasing trend of the field-free JDE with Nb3Cl8 reaching ~48% efficiency, Nb3Br8 ~6%, and Nb3I8 having no discernible JDE, matching the trend of decreasing U/t from Cl to I and suggesting correlation in insulators drives the field-free JDE.

Abstract: Superconductivity with non-trivial band topology provides a novel platform for exploring topological superconductivity and its quantum applications. A detailed microscopic understanding of the superconducting ground state in such materials is crucial. Here, we report the results of a muon spin rotation/relaxation study ($μ$SR) of the topologically non-trivial superconductor SnAs, which exhibits superconductivity below 3.74(1) \si{K}. Zero-field (ZF) $μ$SR data reveal that this system is a time-reversal invariant superconductor, and systematic transverse-field (TF) $μ$SR measurements unveil the type-I nature of the SnAs superconductor. We have established the superconducting phase diagram to understand the intermediate state of type-I superconductors. Moreover, ab \textit{initio} band structure and phonon calculations are performed, which correlate with the experimental characterization.

Motivation: To investigate the superconducting properties of the van der Waals layered quasicrystal Cu-doped Ta$_{1.6}$Te, especially focusing on the gap state and pairing mechanisms.

Method: Fast relaxation technique and initial-slope method were used to detect the electronic specific heat and AC-susceptibility measurements to study the superconducting gap.

Result: A fully gapped state with $Δ(0)/k_{m B} = 1.43$~K was revealed, showing a gap magnitude and specific-heat jump smaller than BCS predictions, along with strongly suppressed quasiparticle excitations. AC-susceptibility measurements indicated a large upper critical field and pronounced anisotropy.

Conclusion: These results provide the first thermodynamic evidence for a full-gap superconducting state in a quasicrystal and highlight unconventional pairing mechanisms beyond periodic lattices.

Abstract: We report the superconducting gap in the van der Waals layered quasicrystal Cu-doped Ta$_{1.6}$Te, using a fast relaxation technique that removes the large nuclear contribution of $^{181}$Ta.
  The initial-slope method enabled detection of the electronic specific heat down to 60~mK, revealing a fully gapped state with $Δ(0)/k_{\rm B} = 1.43$~K.
  Both the gap magnitude and specific-heat jump are smaller than BCS predictions, while quasiparticle excitations are strongly suppressed, consistent with a theoretical expectation for aperiodic systems.
  AC-susceptibility measurements show a large upper critical field and pronounced anisotropy, reflecting the quasi-two-dimensional structure.
  These results provide the first thermodynamic evidence for a full-gap superconducting state in a quasicrystal and highlight unconventional pairing mechanisms beyond periodic lattices.

Abstract: The realization of ambient-pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films raises a fundamental question: is the metallic ground state driven by lattice strain or interfacial charge reconstruction? Using fully self-consistent DFT+$U$ calculations on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ heterostructures, we identify that intrinsic hole doping via interfacial Sr interdiffusion is the decisive factor in stabilizing the metallic state. Our 1-unit-cell model accurately reproduces the ARPES-observed Fermi surface, particularly the critical Ni-$d_{z^2}$ derived $γ$ hole pocket, which originates exclusively from the interface-proximal bilayer. Furthermore, comparative tight-binding analysis suggests that the reduced superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in thin films stems from the synergistic suppression of the electronic density of states (DOS) and vertical superexchange coupling ($J \perp Z$). These findings highlight that interface engineering plays a critical role beyond simple strain imposition in modulating nickelate orbital physics.

Result: Clear bulk signatures of superconductivity observed, with an upper critical field of $H_{\\rm c2}\\approx65$ T at 0.5 K and superconductivity surviving up to $T\\approx 2$ K. Unusual vortex dynamics and pinning suggested by excess attenuation.

Conclusion: The study confirms the existence of bulk superconductivity in UTe$_2$ under high magnetic fields and low temperatures, with unusual vortex dynamics observed.

Abstract: We report bulk ultrasound measurements up to 80 T and down to 0.5 K of the field re-entrant superconducting phase of the unconventional superconductor UTe$_2$. Clear bulk signatures of superconductivity are observed in the longitudinal elastic mode $c_{11}$ for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$ from $b$-axis. We confirm an upper critical field of $H_{\rm c2}\approx65$ T at 0.5 K and bulk superconductivity which survives up to $T\approx 2$ K for fields above the metamagnetic transition. The $c_{11}$ mode has propagation and displacement vectors along the $a$-axis, and for fields applied at a tilt angle of $θ_{b-c} =30^\circ$, this mode is sensitive to the elasticity of the vortex lattice. The anomalies observed in $c_{11}$ are in part reminiscent of superconducting vortices pinned to lattice defects. Nonetheless, an excess attenuation, with respect to the normal state, is observed throughout the entire superconducting phase, suggesting unusual vortex dynamics and pinning in the field re-entrant superconducting phase of UTe$_2$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unphysical logarithmic divergences in quantities such as currents and qubit transition rates caused by the square-root divergent density of states in low-temperature superconductors.

Method: Analytical approximations were derived for the density of states in each superconducting film, focusing on the proximity effect between films with different gaps.

Result: The smearing of the density of states is found to increase with gap asymmetry, leading to smoothening of the jump discontinuity in qubit frequency shift.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the smearing of the density of states in superconducting films grows with gap asymmetry, providing a method to regularize unphysical divergences in quantities like qubit transition rates.

Abstract: The standard mean-field treatment of low-temperature superconductors leads to a square-root divergent density of states at the gap value. This feature can lead to unphysical logarithmic divergences in various quantities, such as currents and qubit transition rates. We revisit their possible regularization based on the proximity effect between two superconducting films with different gaps. We derive analytical approximations for the density of states in each superconducting film. We find that the smearing of the density of states grows with the gap asymmetry. As a concrete example, we discuss the regularization of transition rates in qubits with frequency close to resonance with the gap asymmetry between the two films, and the consequent smoothening of the jump discontinuity in the qubit frequency shift.

Conclusion: 揭示了在强耦合极限下的Kondo格子模型中，由于几何阻挫和电子填充的不同，可以产生四种奇异的自旋电荷耦合基态。

Abstract: We uncover four exotic coupled spin-charge ground states in the strong coupling limit of the Kondo lattice model at various electronic fillings on a frustrated decorated honeycomb lattice, where each regular honeycomb sublattice point is occupied by three-site triangular units. We employ a hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo (hMCMC) simulation method which combines classical MCMC for localized spins and exact diagonalization of the electronic Hamiltonian. Two of the spin-charge ground states, respectively consists of three-site and six-site ferromagnetic (FM) clusters arranged in anti-FM and $120^{\circ}$ Yafet-Kittel (YK) phase which we label as S-AF (super-antiferromagnet) and S-YK (super-YK) respectively. Two even more interesting coupled spin-charge states, respectively accommodate FM dimers and trimers (as three-site line segment), which we label as FM-D and FM-T. In both cases, the anti-FM aligned dimers and trimers in respective phases, are arranged in stripes along one of three lattice directions: the spontaneously symmetry broken phases giving rise to non-trivial macroscopic degeneracy. These underlying magnetic textures (except S-YK state) restrict electrons in fragmented small regions (e.g, triangular units, two-site dimers, three-site line segments respectively in S-AF, FM-D and FM-T), resulting in flat bands by opening large gaps in electronic density of states, which in turn stabilize these coupled spin-charge states: a "band effect". These exotic spin-charge ground states could be relevant to electron-doped spin-systems resulting from various metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which have attracted significant attention to condensed matter physics

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Using theoretical models, the study shows how strain in kagome nanoribbons precisely tunes the Kondo effect, revealing unique electronic behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how strain influences the Kondo effect in kagome materials, given their unique band structure with Dirac points and flat bands, and the potential for investigating topological and many-body correlation effects.

Method: Employed the single-impurity Anderson model and the numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in kagome zigzag nanoribbons under uniaxial strain.

Result: Strain manipulation allows precise control over the Kondo effect strength on an impurity, with symmetric local environments suppressing hybridization due to orbital interference. The impurity's location and proximity to edge states significantly affect the Kondo temperature.

Conclusion: Strain is a powerful tuning parameter in kagome nanoribbons, strongly modifying the screening of magnetic impurities and providing unique insights into correlated-electron behavior.

Abstract: Metallic kagome systems have attracted considerable interest in recent years, as they provide a rich platform for studying phenomena associated with their distinctive band structure. The coexistence of bands with Dirac points similar to those in graphene, along with a completely flat band, makes this an ideal structure for investigating how lattice symmetries may protect topological and many-body correlation effects. Since applied strain can break lattice symmetries and modify the electronic structure, understanding how strain influences phenomena such as the Kondo effect in kagome materials may provide essential insights into correlated-electron behavior. We employ the single-impurity Anderson model and the numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in kagome zigzag nanoribbons under uniaxial strain. We find that strain manipulation enables precise control over the strength of the Kondo effect on an impurity hybridized on the ribbon with different coordination environments, and that symmetric local environments may result in strong suppression of the effective hybridization due to orbital interference. We find that the specific location of the impurity on the ribbon, especially when the Fermi energy lies close to weakly dispersive edge states, can lead to significant changes in the characteristic Kondo temperature. Such sensitivity may be used to provide unique information on the local density of states of a system. These results demonstrate that strain is a powerful tuning parameter in kagome nanoribbons, strongly modifying the screening of magnetic impurities.

### [12] [Impact of strong electronic correlations on altermagnets: the case of NiS2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17059)
*Ina Park,Turan Birol,Antoine Georges,Rafael M. Fernandes*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: NiS2 serves as a model for studying strong correlations in metallic altermagnets, revealing how static and dynamic interactions reshape electronic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the spin-dependent electronic structure of metallic altermagnets, particularly through the lens of NiS2.

Method: DFT, DFT+U, and DFT+DMFT calculations were systematically compared on the metallic altermagnetic phase near the MIT.

Result: Strong correlations modify the spin splitting of bands through enhanced local magnetic moments (static) and momentum-dependent bandwidth renormalization (dynamic). Dynamic correlations also cause a lifetime asymmetry between spin-up and spin-down quasiparticles.

Conclusion: NiS2 is established as a platform to study the interplay between Mott and Hund physics with altermagnetic order, highlighting the impact of strong correlations on the electronic structure of metallic altermagnets.

Abstract: One of the distinguishing features of an altermagnet is that its spin-up and spin-down bands display a nodal momentum-dependent splitting even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. While this property has been investigated in many weakly-correlated altermagnetic materials, the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the spin-dependent electronic structure has remained little explored, particularly in metals. Here, we propose NiS2 as a prototypical strongly correlated metallic altermagnet. While at ambient pressure this compound is an altermagnetic Mott insulator, it undergoes a pressure-driven metal-insulator transition (MIT) while maintaining its altermagnetic ordered phase. By systematically comparing DFT, DFT+U, and DFT+DMFT calculations on the metallic altermagnetic phase near the MIT, we disentangle how strong static and dynamic correlations modify the electronic structure. Specifically, the spin splitting of the bands is modified not only through the enhancement of the local magnetic moment caused by static correlations, but also by the momentum-dependent bandwidth renormalization caused by dynamic correlations. Moreover, dynamic electronic correlations cause a pronounced lifetime asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down quasiparticles, an effect that is amplified by the particle-hole asymmetry promoted by Hund's correlations. Our results not only shed light on the rich landscape of correlation effects in metallic altermagnets, but also establishes NiS2 as a platform to investigate the interplay between Mott and Hund physics and altermagnetic order.

Motivation: To understand the magnetic properties of the frustrated quantum magnet PHCC through microscopic analysis.

Method: Combined density-functional band-structure calculations and numerical quantum many-body simulations of the spin Hamiltonian.

Result: The proposed model captures the magnetic behavior, including susceptibility, magnetization, and excitation spectrum, and predicts the existence of bound and anti-bound states of triplets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the magnetism of PHCC is effectively described by a one-dimensional frustrated spin chain model with specific coupling constants, providing insights into its magnetic susceptibility, magnetization process, and excitation spectrum.

Abstract: We report a comprehensive microscopic study of the frustrated quantum magnet PHCC, (C$_4$H$_{12}$N$_2$)Cu$_2$Cl$_6$, using density-functional band-structure calculations combined with numerical quantum many-body simulations of the underlying spin Hamiltonian. We show that the magnetism of PHCC is captured by a one-dimensional model of the frustrated spin chain with alternating nearest-neighbor couplings ($J_1=23.1$ K, $J_1'=7.0$ K) and uniform next-nearest-neighbor couplings ($J_2=13.9$ K). This model, which can also be thought of as a zigzag ladder, provides a quantitative description of the magnetic susceptibility and the magnetization process, and accounts for the observed dispersion of the single-triplet band and its merging into a continuum near the Brillouin zone center. We also make predictions for the existence of sharp bound (anti-bound) states of two triplets, below (above) the bottom (upper) edge of the two-particle scattering continuum.

Abstract: Altermagnetism (AM) has brought renewed attention to the Lieb lattice. Here, we broaden the scope of altermagnetic models on the Lieb lattice by using a general scheme based on spin clusters. We design various altermagnetic models with d- and g-wave on the Lieb lattice, and investigate its interplay with spin-orbit coupling. While the altermagnetic unit cell reconstructs the topological edge states in the strip geometry and leads to the emergence of Dirac points, the in-plane magnetic moments of AM can induce gaps at these points. In an open square geometry, corner modes emerge within these gaps, realizing higher-order topological states. We further verify that the induction of higher-order topology is applicable to all altermagnetic configurations constructed here on the Lieb lattice, and is most pronounced for AM by comparing with the other types of magnetism such as ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism. Our results highlight the exotic properties of AM, and suggest its potential applications in engineering topological quantum states.

Motivation: To investigate correlated topological CDW states and uncover hidden-order phase transitions in the quasi-one-dimensional type-III Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I.

Method: Low-frequency resistance noise spectroscopy, electrical transport, thermoelectric measurements, and first-principles calculations were employed.

Result: An additional hidden-order phase transition at $T^* \sim 100$ K was discovered, characterized by enhanced noise exponent and variance of resistance fluctuations. The transition involves a structural distortion leading to Fermi surface reconstruction and a bandgap opening in the hidden-order phase.

Conclusion: The findings reveal a previously unidentified correlated phase transition in the topological CDW-Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I, enriching its phase diagram and establishing it as an ideal platform for studying intertwined electronic and structural orders.

Abstract: The emergence of a charge density wave (CDW) in a Weyl semimetal -- a correlated topological phase, is exceptionally rare in condensed matter systems. In this context, the quasi-one-dimensional type-III Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I undergoes a CDW transition at $T_{\mathrm{CDW}} \approx 263$~K, providing an exceptional platform to investigate correlated topological CDW states. Here, we uncover an additional hidden-order phase transition at $T^* \sim 100$ K, well below the CDW onset, using low-frequency resistance noise spectroscopy, electrical transport, and thermoelectric measurements. This transition is characterized by a sharp enhancement in the noise exponent ($α$) and variance of resistance fluctuations. Analysis of higher-order statistics of resistance fluctuations reveals the correlated dynamics underlying the transition. A pronounced anomaly in the Seebeck coefficient near $T^*$ further suggests a Fermi surface reconstruction. First-principles calculations reveal a structural distortion from the high-symmetry $I422$ phase to a low-symmetry $C2$ phase, via an intermediate $I4$ symmetry. This leads to renormalization of the electronic structure near the Fermi level and opening of a bandgap in the hidden-order phase. These findings demonstrate a previously unidentified correlated phase transition in the topological CDW-Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I, enriching the phase diagram of this material and establishing it as an ideal platform for studying intertwined electronic and structural orders.

Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates have attracted intense interest following the discovery of superconductivity in several members of the series, including bilayer (BL) La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, trilayer (TL) La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, and structural polymorphs composed of monolayer-bilayer or monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) units. However, an inherent propensity of the RP series to form intergrown phases during single-crystal synthesis, together with spatial variations in oxygen stoichiometry, has complicated the determination of their intrinsic material properties. As a consequence, conflicting reports have emerged on both their electronic phase transitions and lattice dynamics. In this work, we perform a comparative study of the phononic and electronic Raman responses of high-quality ML-TL single crystals and contrast them with those of other RP nickelates, using samples with optimized oxygen content. We establish several Raman spectral features that enable unambiguous phase identification across the series. Moreover, we uncover characteristics in the phononic and electronic Raman response of ML-TL that are not reflected in the pure ML and TL compounds. We attribute these differences to a distinctive electronic structure arising from self-doping and confinement effects induced by the ML unit within the ML-TL lattice architecture.

Motivation: To investigate the stability of topological phases in doped Kitaev-Heisenberg ladders by studying the competition with itinerant electrons and the associated charge fluctuations.

Method: Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations to analyze the evolution of string order parameters, spin correlations, and charge fluctuations as functions of hopping amplitude and interaction strength in a half-filled band.

Result: Increasing electron bandwidth progressively suppresses the topological phases, shifting and narrowing their stability regions in the phase diagram. Critical values of hopping where string order vanishes are identified.

Abstract: We investigate the stability of topological phases in doped Kitaev-Heisenberg ladders by studying the competition with itinerant electrons and the associated charge fluctuations in a Hubbard model on a honeycomb ribbon geometry. We analyze the evolution of string order parameters, spin correlations, and charge fluctuations as functions of hopping amplitude and interaction strength in a half-filled band. Our results from density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations show that increasing electron bandwidth progressively suppresses the topological phases, shifting and narrowing their stability regions in the phase diagram. We identify the critical values of hopping where string order vanishes and characterize the interplay between magnetic order and charge fluctuations. These findings provide insight into the robustness of topological phases against doping and charge dynamics, with implications for candidate Kitaev materials and engineered quantum systems.

Abstract: The crystal structure of high-pressure solid hydrogen remains a fundamental open problem. Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications.

TL;DR: CDMFT study shows short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations drive vertex divergence in 2D systems, leading to Mott transition and phase-separation instabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how short-range correlations lead to the breakdown of self-consistent perturbation theory in two-dimensional systems and explore the associated physical consequences.

Method: The research employs cellular dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) and derives the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism systematically, focusing on the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling and intermediate coupling.

Result: Short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations cause the divergence of the two-particle irreducible vertex at lower interactions compared to the DMFT case. The divergence is linked to the change in eigenvalues of the generalized charge susceptibility.

Conclusion: The study identifies the change of sign of the eigenvalues of the generalized charge susceptibility as a key factor driving the Mott transition and phase-separation instabilities in two-dimensional systems.

Abstract: By means of cellular dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) we study how short-range correlations drive the breakdown of the self-consistent perturbation theory in two-dimensional systems and the most relevant physical consequences associated to it. To this aim, we first derive in a structured and consistent way the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism at the CDMFT level in all physical channels, explicitly addressing the important aspect of the related Ward identities. In this context, we perform systematic calculations of the BSE for the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling at intermediate coupling. Our study illustrates how the divergence of a fundamental building block of the BSE in the charge channel, the two-particle irreducible vertex, systematically occurs at lower interactions than in the (purely local) DMFT case, due to short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Further, the change of sign of the eigenvalues of the generalized charge susceptibility associated to the vertex divergences is identified as the essential prerequisite to drive, at larger interaction values, the physics of the Mott transition in two dimensions, as well as of the adjacent phase-separation instabilities.

Abstract: A conclusive experimental realization of 2D chiral topological superconductivity remains elusive. Here we present a theoretical demonstration that a topological $d+id$ fractionalized superconducting phase (SC*) can emerge in the weak-coupling limit of a Kondo lattice model, where conduction electrons interact with a Yao-Lee spin liquid on the honeycomb lattice (the Yao-Lee-Kondo model). Using a renormalization-group analysis, we show that exchanging Majorana spinons from the Yao-Lee spin liquid generates effective interactions among the conduction electrons and drives a Cooper instability even for arbitrarily weak Kondo coupling. We further find that the induced leading inter-orbital antiferromagnetic interaction selects topological $d+id$ spin-singlet pairing with Chern number $C=\pm 2$. Meanwhile, the Majorana fermions in the Yao-Lee spin liquid remain gapless and deconfined in this regime, so the resulting state is a fractionalized topological $d+id$ superconductor (SC*). For sufficiently strong Kondo coupling, the system instead enters a heavy Fermi liquid phase with fractionalization (HFL*).

TL;DR: A compact U(1) gauge theory describes heavy fermions in the local-moment regime, revealing two regimes: a heavy-fermion metal and a Kondo-breakdown metal, with distinct transport properties and Luttinger volumes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand the behavior of heavy fermions in the local-moment regime, focusing on their description via a compact U(1) gauge theory and the interplay between composite-fermion resonances and transport properties.

Method: The paper employs sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a spin chain coupled to two-dimensional Dirac conduction electrons, described by fermionic partons carrying spin and U(1) gauge charge.

Result: Two symmetry-equivalent regimes are identified: a heavy-fermion metal with sharp composite-fermion resonance and robust transport, and a Kondo-breakdown metal with incoherent resonance and vanishing transport. The Luttinger volume counts both composite and conduction electrons in the heavy-fermion phase but only conduction electrons in the Kondo-breakdown phase.

Conclusion: The study provides a nonperturbative demonstration of gauge-mediated Kondo breakdown and identifies transport fingerprints of an orbital-selective Mott transition in U(1) gauge theories of heavy fermions.

Abstract: In the local-moment regime, heavy fermions are most economically described by a compact U(1) gauge theory. With this formulation of the Kondo lattice, we study a spin chain coupled to two-dimensional Dirac conduction electrons. The spin chain is described by fermionic partons carrying spin and U(1) gauge charge. The heavy-fermion quasiparticle is a bound state of a U(1) matter field carrying unit electric and U(1) gauge charge, and the fermionic parton. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we identify two symmetry-equivalent regimes: a heavy-fermion metal with a sharp composite-fermion resonance and robust low-frequency transport, and a Kondo-breakdown metal with an incoherent resonance and vanishing low-frequency transport. For any finite lattice extent in the direction perpendicular to the chain, the Luttinger volume of the heavy-fermion phase counts both composite and conduction electrons, while in the Kondo-breakdown phase it counts only the conduction electrons. The evolution of the composite-fermion spectrum, dynamical spin structure factor, and optical conductivity provides a nonperturbative demonstration of gauge-mediated Kondo breakdown and establishes transport fingerprints of an orbital-selective Mott transition in the context of U(1) gauge theories of heavy fermions.

Abstract: What are the fundamental limitations for finite-time engines that extract work from active nonequilibrium systems, and what are the optimal protocols that approach them? We show that the finite-time work extraction for nonconservative overdamped Langevin systems may be rewritten as a Lorentz force Lagrangian action, with the kinetic term corresponding to a thermodynamic metric term that is an $L_2$-optimal transport cost for the time-dependent probability density, and the magnetic field coupling term corresponding to an effective quasistatic work extraction, proving that optimal protocols counterdiabatically steer the thermodynamic state trajectory to satisfy a Lorentz force law defined on thermodynamic state space. We utilize and reinterpret classic concepts from electromagnetism in the setting of cyclical nonequilibrium processes. We show that the housekeeping heat can be controlled to be arbitrarily close to zero by minimizing nonequilibrium fluctuations. It immediately follows from our results that the constant-velocity angle clamp protocol applied to the $F_1$ molecular motor in a recent experiment [Mishima et at, 2025] is in fact the globally optimal protocol: it produces zero housekeeping heat and simultaneously minimizes dissipation and maximizes work transduction.

TL;DR: A two-disease SIR co-infection model shows that slower recovery for co-infected individuals increases co-infection burden and epidemic duration, while reducing the recovery rate can raise the epidemic peak.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how distinct recovery rates for co-infected individuals affect the dynamics of coupled SIR processes and the overall epidemic behavior.

Method: The authors use a symmetric two-disease SIR co-infection model on networks, employing mean-field approximation and analyzing an invariant subsystem to study the impact of co-infection recovery rates.

Result: The basic reproduction number aligns with independent SIR processes, slower co-infection recovery increases co-infection burden and epidemic duration, and reduced recovery rates can elevate the epidemic peak.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that co-infection-specific recovery dynamics significantly influence transient epidemic behavior, particularly in terms of co-infection burden, epidemic duration, and peak, even without endemic equilibria.

Abstract: We study a symmetric two-disease SIR co-infection model on networks in which co-infected individuals recover at a rate distinct from that of single infections. The model explicitly represents all co-infection states and features absorbing recovered compartments for both diseases. Within a mean-field network approximation, we derive the basic reproduction number of the coupled system and show that invasion thresholds coincide with those of two independent SIR processes. Exploiting an exchange symmetry in the equal-transmission regime, we reduce the dynamics to a lower-dimensional invariant subsystem and analyze the impact of the co-infection recovery rate. We prove that slower recovery of co-infected individuals monotonically increases the co-infection burden and yields a lower bound on epidemic duration that grows as the co-infection recovery rate decreases. Numerical simulations further indicate that reduced co-infection recovery can increase the epidemic peak, an effect supported by a sensitivity-equation analysis. Together, these results highlight how co-infection-specific recovery dynamics can substantially alter transient epidemic behavior, even in the absence of endemic equilibria.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which synthetic energy distributions with scale-invariant dynamics resemble real earthquake behavior.

Method: The research involves analyzing earthquake energy statistics from seismic catalogs, generating synthetic energy distributions with varying exponents, and comparing these to real earthquake data.

Result: Synthetic earthquakes with exponents between 1.58 and 1.76 closely mimic real earthquake behavior, with specific physical mechanisms governing dynamics in different exponent ranges.

Conclusion: The study identifies the physical mechanisms that govern earthquake dynamics under different scaling exponents, providing insights into the conditions under which synthetic earthquakes mimic real seismic behavior.

Abstract: We analyze regional earthquake energy statistics from the Southern California and Japan seismic catalogs and find scale-invariant energy distributions characterized by an exponent $τ\simeq 1.67$. To quantify how closely scale-invariant dynamics with different exponent values resemble real earthquakes, we generate synthetic energy distributions over a wide range of $τ$ under conditions of constant activity. Earthquake-like behavior, in a broad sense, is obtained for $1.5 \leqslant τ< 2.0$. When energy variations are further restricted to be within a factor of ten relative to real earthquakes, the admissible range narrows to $1.58 \leqslant τ\leqslant 1.76$. We identify the physical mechanisms governing the dynamics in the different regimes: fault dynamics characterized by a balance between slow energy accumulation and release through scale-free events in the earthquake-like regime; externally supplied energy relative to a slowly driven fault for $τ< 1.5$; and dominance of small events in the energy budget for $τ> 2$

Abstract: We study a conservative stochastic lattice dynamics (Kawasaki dynamics) in contact everywhere in the bulk with a heat bath. Particles interact via an Ising Hamiltonian and phase separation occurs at low temperature. We drive the system out of equilibrium by imposing a temperature field that varies spatially on macroscopic scales while preserving local equilibrium. Under these conditions, the usual low-temperature long-range order is replaced by robust convection patterns, featuring regularly spaced stripe structures for suitable geometries. These nonequilibrium states differ markedly from those obtained in an equilibrium dynamics with the same local temperature profile. We develop a macroscopic description that captures these behaviors and provides a unified framework for understanding the observed patterns.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the quantum geometric contribution to the diffusion constant and DC conductivity in metals and semimetals with linear Dirac dispersion.

Method: The paper employs a rigorous separation of the quantum geometric and band velocity contributions to the diffusion constant by analyzing the rank two tensor structure.

Result: A clear separation of quantum geometric and band velocity contributions to the diffusion constant is established, with three-dimensional Dirac fermions at charge neutrality showing purely quantum geometric behavior.

Conclusion: The diffusion constant of three-dimensional Dirac fermions at charge neutrality is entirely quantum geometric in origin, unlike in two dimensions, due to the cancellation of the band velocity contribution.

Abstract: We discuss the quantum geometric contribution to the diffusion constant and the DC conductivity in metals and semimetals with linear Dirac dispersion. We demonstrate that, for systems with perfectly linear dispersion, there exists a clear and rigorous separation of the quantum geometric from the ordinary band velocity contributions to the diffusion constant, which turns out to be directly related to the separation of a rank two tensor into transverse and longitudinal parts. We also demonstrate that the diffusion constant of three-dimensional Dirac fermions at charge neutrality is entirely quantum geometric in origin, which is not the case for two-dimensional Dirac fermions. This is the result of an accidental perfect cancellation of the band velocity contribution in three dimensions.

Abstract: Recently, a host of exotic magnetic textures such as topologically protected skyrmion lattices has been discovered in several bulk metallic lanthanide compounds. In addition to hosting skyrmion phases, a hallmark of this class of materials is the appearance of numerous spin textures characterized by a superposition of multi-$q$ magnetic modulations: spin moiré superlattices. The nuanced energy landscape thus motivates detailed studies to understand the underlying interactions. Here, we comprehensively characterize and model the three zero-field magnetic textures present in one such material, EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$. Systematic symmetry breaking experiments using magnetic field and strain determine that the ground state incommensurate magnetic phase (ICM1) is single-$q$. In contrast, ICM2 and ICM3 are both double-$q$, \textit{i.e.}, spin moiré superlattices. Further, through application of polarized small angle neutron scattering and spherical neutron polarimetry, we demonstrate that ICM1 is a single-$q$ cycloid and ICM2 and ICM3 are double-$q$ vortex lattices, with Eu moments lying in the $ab$-plane in zero field and with a ferromagnetic component at finite field. Despite the quasi-2D nature of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, the modulations propagate out of the \textit{ab}-plane, leading to a shift of the spin texture between triangle lattice planes. Further, the ICM3 to ICM2 transition includes an unusual 45$^\circ$ rotation of the magnetic vortex lattice. Motivated by the coexistence of such drastically different phases in this compound, we conclude by developing a phenomenological model to understand the stability of these states. Our experimental probes and theoretical modeling definitively characterize three different and tunable phases in one material, and provide insight for the design of new topological spin-texture materials.

Abstract: Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes were first proposed in 1976 as topologically protected zero-energy states localized at domain walls in one-dimensional Dirac systems. They have attracted widespread attention in the field of topological quantum computing, as they serve as non-superconducting analogs of Majorana zero modes and support non-Abelian statistics in topological insulator systems. %In the braiding process of the Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, their braiding properties are closely related to the strength of disorder. However, compared to their Majorana cousins, the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes are vulnerable to the on-site energy deviation between the modes involved in the experiment. In this work, we propose to estimate the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero-modes through measurements of transport signatures, which are readily measurable in current experiments. We find that the fidelity of braiding operation reaches unity when the current noise is fully suppressed, while this braiding fidelity monotonously decreases with the increasing of the current noise. Based on these transport signatures, we further discuss the correspondence between Majorana and Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, highlighting their similarity in supporting non-Abelian statistics.

Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the emergence of chiral topological superconductivity in small-angle twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG). Using the low-energy continuum model and incorporating spin-triplet $p_{x}+i p_{y}$ pairing in each graphene layer, we construct the effective models for both tBLG and tDBLG with superconductivity. By varying the chemical potential, superconducting order parameter, and twist angle, we explore the emergence of topological superconducting phases via the calculation of Chern numbers. Our phase diagrams for tBLG and tDBLG (both AB-AB and AB-BA stackings) reveal distinct topological transitions, which are consistently marked by bulk gap-closing points. To gain further insight, we analyze the evolution of Chern numbers by tracking the number and location of gap closings within the moiré Brillouin zone. Additionally, we illustrate representative squared amplitude of Bloch states corresponding to different topological phases. In the later part of our study, the effect of trigonal warping on the topological superconducting properties is also discussed. Beyond the quantitative results, our study highlights how the interplay between moiré band structure and unconventional pairing symmetries enriches the landscape of possible superconducting states in twisted graphene systems. The framework developed here may also be extended to other multilayer moiré materials, offering a route towards engineering exotic topological superconductivity with tunable parameters.

Motivation: To explore the spin Hall effect's correlation between AC electric current and magnetization dynamics in a ferromagnet, focusing on the emergent reactance contribution.

Method: A comprehensive theoretical analysis was conducted in the frequency regime relevant to transport measurements up to a few GHz.

Result: The reactance exhibits an inductor-like behavior at low frequencies below ferromagnetic resonance, with its sign determined by the spin transfer mechanism at the interface.

Conclusion: The study identifies the reactance as a key observable for distinguishing between interfacial spin transfer processes, with its sign governed by the competition between damping-like and field-like components.

Abstract: The spin Hall effect in a heavy metal intercorrelates an AC electric current to the magnetization dynamics in an adjacent ferromagnet, which manifests as an electric reactance in the system's current-voltage response. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis for this emergent reactance contribution in the frequency regime relevant to transport measurements up to a few GHz. Our analysis reveals that the reactance becomes inductor-like at low frequency below the ferromagnetic resonance. Crucially, we find that the sign of the reactance is directly governed by the spin transfer mechanism at the interface, which depends on the competition between its damping-like and field-like components parametrized by the spin mixing conductance. This characteristic behavior in the reactance offers a powerful transport observable in distinguishing the interfacial spin transfer processes in spintronic materials.

Abstract: The injection, propagation and detection of spin currents are essential physical processes in spintronics. So far, the separation of charge and spin currents was facilitated by the electrical spin injection from a ferromagnet (FM) or the injection by a relativistic spin Hall effect. The devices employed are lateral spin valves comprising spatially separated injection and detection electrodes, connected by a spin-propagation channel. The time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking FM spin injection is realized in a geometry with an electrical bias applied between the injection electrode and the channel and is modelled by a conserved spin-polarized drift current. In contrast, the spin injection by the T-symmetric relativistic spin Hall mechanism is driven by an electrical bias applied across the injection electrode alone, and is modelled by a non-conserved spin current transverse to the applied bias. In this work, we use a lateral spin valve with a Mn5Si3 injection electrode to directly demonstrate a TRS-breaking spin injection from a compensated magnet with a vanishing net magnetization. Specifically, the TRS-breaking is demonstrated by the fact that switching between time-reversed states of the compensated magnet changes the detected spin signal. Moreover, the TRS-breaking nature of the spin injection is observed in both experimental geometries with the different electrical biasing, while using the same detection electrode. We show that this unconventional spin-injection is consistent with different magnitudes and propagation angles of electrical currents in the spin-up and spin-down channel in a d-wave altermagnet. Here our symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations are based on the compensated collinear altermagnetic order which has provided a comprehensive microscopic interpretation of earlier structural, magnetic, and anomalous Hall and Nernst measurements in Mn5Si3 thin films.

Abstract: We study how topological crystalline defects--dislocations--reshape the real-space quantum geometric tensor and act as tunable sources of quantum geometry. We show that dislocations strongly enhance the quantum metric, establishing a direct link between lattice topology and the Hilbert-space geometry of states. We characterize the quantum geometry of topological magnons in ordered arrays of dislocations, demonstrating that defect-induced geometric enhancement controls their localization and topological protection. In disordered arrays, dislocation-driven geometry expands the accessible topological phase space and enables transitions to disorder-induced topological phases. Our results identify the quantum metric as a tunable bridge between crystalline topology, magnonic excitations, and emergent topological matter in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems.

Abstract: Recent progress in constructing supramolecular assemblies with hierarchical chirality offers new opportunities to investigate the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect and its potential applications. In this work, we systematically examine the CISS effect in such multichiral systems by designing a class of multilayer helical architectures constructed of stacked and interfaced individual helical rings, each possessing well-defined local chirality. Through controlled interlayer twisting, a global helical handedness is further imposed, forming a multichiral tubular helix. Theoretical calculations reveal that these two distinct chiral hierarchies lead to several unprecedented CISS phenomena, such as enhanced spin polarization arising from cooperative dual chirality, along with the simultaneous emergence of transverse and longitudinal CISS signals. Moreover, interlayer torsional competition modulates the system's response to external fields. The dual-chiral geometry breaks the conventional symmetry of single helices, inducing an anomalous angular phase shift in magnetoresistance. Furthermore, Floquet analysis reveals that the interplay between local and global chirality enables controlled spin polarization switching under circularly polarized light. These findings provide a basic theoretical framework for studying the CISS in multichiral superstructures and establish design principles for coupled optical, magnetic, and spin manipulations, thereby facilitating the development of multichiral spintronic devices.

Motivation: To resolve the physics of domain localization during ultrafast phase transitions, particularly the nucleation and localization processes, which remain unresolved despite the common observation of nanometer-scale domains.

Method: The researchers used shot-resolved pump-probe resonant x-ray scattering and a material with a periodically modulated magnetic anisotropy landscape to track the laser-driven nucleation and localization of nanometer-scale spin textures in real time.

Result: Nucleation occurs homogeneously via fluctuations early on, while spatially periodic structures emerge later and localize in less than one nanosecond under suitable conditions. Real-space simulations indicate that localization is governed by strong lateral variations in spin-texture lifetimes.

Conclusion: The study shows that ultrafast phase-transition dynamics differ fundamentally from conventional transitions but can still be controlled through nanometer-scale tailoring of the energy landscape.

Abstract: Ultrashort laser pulses provide the fastest known way to switch magnetic order. Such excitation commonly creates nanometer-scale domains, even after homogeneous illumination when the position of nucleated domains is not externally defined. However, the physics of domain localization during such ultrafast phase transitions remains unresolved. Here, we use shot-resolved pump-probe resonant x-ray scattering together with a material featuring a periodically modulated magnetic anisotropy landscape to track, in real time, the laser-driven nucleation and localization of nanometer-scale spin textures. We find that nucleation and localization are two distinct processes. Nucleation occurs homogeneously via fluctuations at early times, whereas spatially periodic structures emerge only later and, under suitable conditions, localize in less than one nanosecond. Real-space simulations show that this localization is governed by strong lateral variations in spin-texture lifetimes. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast phase-transition dynamics fundamentally differ from conventional transitions, yet still can be controlled through moderate nanometer-scale tailoring of the energy landscape.

### [36] [Higher-Order Topological Systems and Their Sub-Symmetry-Protected Topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17694)
*Myungjun Kang,Wonjun Sung,Sonu Verma,Sangmo Cheon*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper explores how sub-symmetry-protected topology applies to higher-order systems, showing that certain boundary states retain topological features under specific perturbations while others lose them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to extend the understanding of sub-symmetry-protected topology to higher-order topological systems, addressing how partial symmetry breaking affects topological boundary states and their properties.

Method: The research employs numerical and analytical methods to track the evolution of sub-symmetry-protected boundary states. It introduces sub-symmetry-protecting perturbations and examines their effects on topological features, using the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model as a representative example.

Result: Sub-symmetry-protected corner states in second-order topological insulators remain pinned at zero energy with quantized quadrupole moments under perturbations, while broken-symmetry states lose these features. In a three-dimensional semimetal, some hinge-localized modes retain topological properties under perturbations, while others do not.

Conclusion: The study extends the concept of sub-symmetry-protected topology to higher-order topological systems, demonstrating that sub-symmetry-protected boundary states retain topological features under specific perturbations. This framework is validated for both second-order topological insulators and semimetals, highlighting the diagnostic role of state-resolved quadrupole moments.

Abstract: Symmetry and topology are essential principles in topological physics. Recently, the idea of sub-symmetry-protected topology -- where some of the original symmetries are broken while a remaining subset, called sub-symmetries, continues to protect specific boundary states -- has been developed. Here, we extend sub-symmetry-protected topology to higher-order topological systems from second-order topological insulators to semimetals. By introducing a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation that acts on a single sublattice and selectively preserves specific topological boundary states, we track the evolution of these states and their topological features using numerical and analytical methods, and we show that state-resolved quadrupole moments diagnose which corner or hinge modes remain topological. As a representative example of a second-order topological insulator, we begin with the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. We demonstrate that, under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation, sub-symmetry-protected corner states remain pinned at zero energy and maintain quantized state-resolved quadrupole moments. In contrast, corner states on sub-symmetry-broken boundaries shift away from zero energy and lose their quantized character. We further extend this framework to a three-dimensional second-order topological semimetal, constructed by stacking second-order topological insulator layers, and analyze how second-order Fermi arc states -- hinge-localized modes that link the projections of bulk Dirac points, in contrast to conventional surface Fermi arcs -- evolve under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation. While one second-order Fermi arc becomes dispersive and loses its quadrupolar character under a sub-symmetry-breaking perturbation, the remaining second-order Fermi arcs retain chiral symmetry and preserve quantized quadrupolar characters.

Abstract: Structure and morphology play a crucial role in enhancing the biomimetic oxidase activity of nanozymes. In this study, a facile \emph{in situ} chemical oxidation strategy was employed to synthesize MOF-derived MnO$_x$, utilizing the structural features of the parent MOF to enhance oxidase-mimicking activity. We systematically investigated the effects of phase evolution, structural modulation, and morphology on the oxidase activity of MnO$_x$ with Fe substitution. The oxidase-like activity was evaluated using the chromogenic substrate 3,3$'$,5,5$'$-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), which produced a blue-colored oxidized TMB (ox-TMB) with an absorption peak at 652~nm upon oxidation. While all Fe-doped MnO$_x$ nanostructures exhibited oxidase-like activity, the 10\% Fe-doped sample (10Fe-MnO$_x$) demonstrated the highest performance, likely due to a synergistic effect of structure, morphology, and the presence of oxygen vacancies. The underlying oxidase mechanism was investigated using steady-state kinetics and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis. In addition, a colorimetric assay was developed for the detection of Hg$^{2+}$ and hydroquinone (HQ) in real water samples collected from industrial and natural sources. The calculated detection limits of the 10Fe-MnO$_x$ colorimetric probe for HQ (1.74~$μ$M) and Hg$^{2+}$ (0.47~$μ$M) outperformed those of conventional metal oxide-based nanozymes. These findings pave the way for the development of easily synthesizable, scalable, and highly sensitive oxidase-based MOF-derived metal oxide nanomaterials with significant potential in biological and environmental applications.

Motivation: To explore and characterize non-Hermitian effects arising from dissipative coupling in light-matter systems, such as level attraction and anomalous dispersions.

Method: Parametric study of polariton systems under dissipative and coherent coupling, employing analytical methods and coherent states for the classical limit.

Result: Conditions for negative effective mass, exceptional points, and bound states in the continuum were analytically identified as functions of detuning, coupling ratio, and decay rates.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive analysis of non-Hermitian effects in polariton systems, identifying key conditions for phenomena like negative effective mass and exceptional points, and bridges the quantum-classical divide through a non-Hermitian framework.

Abstract: Dissipative coupling refers to the effect where two systems interact with each other mediated by dissipation channels. Recent advances in controlling light-matter systems have opened new avenues to explore non-Hermitian effects arising from dissipative coupling, such as level attraction and anomalous dispersions. In this work, we perform a parametric study of these effects in a polariton system, i.e., a light-matter superposition, under both dissipative and coherent coupling. We characterize the effects of different sources of non-Hermitian behavior and analytically identify the conditions for the emergence of negative effective mass, exceptional points, and bound states in the continuum as a function of the light-matter detuning, the coherent-to-dissipative coupling ratio, and the relative decay rate of the non-interacting subsystems. We also analyze the classical limit of the polariton system within a non-Hermitian framework, employing coherent states.

Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions are nanoscale composite textures that exhibit high-speed, Hall-free current-driven motion and recently demonstrated self-propulsion. These remarkable properties rely on the stability of the SAF skyrmion's topological bound state, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using an atomistic spin model, we analyze the collapse pathways of bilayer SAF skyrmions in homochiral systems, where both ferromagnetic layers share the same Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) vectors, and in heterochiral systems, where the DMI vectors have opposite directions. We find that pair destruction occurs either by decoupling or by sequential collapse into the homogeneous antiferromagnetic state, so the activation energy is set by the smaller of these two barriers. By examining how these barriers vary with DMI strength, anisotropy, magnetic field, and interlayer exchange, we identify regimes of enhanced stability. In particular, increasing interlayer coupling strengthens homochiral skyrmions but weakens heterochiral ones, while reducing the anisotropy constant effectively stabilizes heterochiral SAF skyrmions. These results outline viable strategies to optimize SAF heterostructures for enhanced skyrmion stability in racetrack devices and emerging active skyrmionic systems.

Abstract: We investigate bipartite entanglement and prove that in constrained energy subspaces, the entanglement spectra of multiple bipartitions are the same across the whole subspace. We show that in quantum many-body systems the bipartite entanglement entropy is affected in such a way that it forms "bundles" under unitary time evolution. Leveraging the structure of the subspace, we present methods to verify whether the entanglement spectrum of two bipartitions is identical throughout the entire subspace. For the subspace defined by the parity embedding, we further provide an algorithm that can determine this in polynomial time.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes gravitationally induced entanglement experiments using AQFT, highlighting challenges like subsystem independence and microcausality violations, and proposes alternative tests for quantum gravity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the theoretical assumptions behind proposals for detecting entanglement between spatially superposed masses as a test of quantum gravity, particularly addressing challenges like subsystem independence and microcausality violations.

Method: Examining the theoretical underpinnings of GIE experiments through algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing operational and algebraic notions of independence, and exploring implications for entanglement witnesses and the Tsirelson bound.

Result: The study reveals that state and measurement independence of subsystems is nontrivial due to gauge and gravitational dressing effects. It also shows that violations of microcausality may impact the interpretation and design of quantum gravity tests, while suggesting an alternative avenue for probing quantum gravity.

Conclusion: The study highlights that although gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) experiments are promising for probing the quantum nature of gravity, they are complicated by subsystem independence issues arising from gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. The analysis suggests that bounding dressing-induced microcausality violations could serve as an alternative probe for quantum gravity.

Abstract: Recent proposals suggest that detecting entanglement between two spatially superposed masses would establish the quantum nature of gravity. However, these gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) experiments rely on assumptions about subsystem independence. We sharpen the theoretical underpinnings of such proposals by examining them through the lens of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing distinct operational and algebraic notions of independence. We argue that state and measurement independence of subsystems, essential to the experimental logic, is nontrivial in the presence of gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. Using gravitationally dressed fields, we recall that commutation relations between spacelike separated observables are nontrivial, undermining strict Hilbert space factorization. We further explore the implications for entanglement witnesses, investigating the Tsirelson bound when subsystem algebras fail to commute, and showing that the Tsirelson bound persists for a suitably symmetrized CHSH observable even though the operational status of such "joint" observables becomes delicate when commensurability fails. Our analysis highlights how even within linearized covariant quantum gravity, violations of microcausality may affect both the interpretation, modelling, and design of proposed laboratory tests of quantum gravity, despite remaining negligible for current experimental regimes. Although we consider GIE-style protocols as a concrete case study, the subsystem-independence issues we highlight are generic to low-energy (perturbative) quantum gravity. Finally, we derive estimates for dressing-induced microcausality violations, which suggest a complementary avenue to current proposals: in principle, bounding dressing-induced microcausality violations themselves as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity.

Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states are critical resources in photonic quantum information processing, rendering their generation and characterization of increasing importance in quantum optics. In this work, we theoretically and numerically analyze the relative efficiency of homodyne versus heterodyne measurements for reconstructing non-Gaussian states, a major outstanding question in continuous-variable tomography. Combining a Fisher information-based formalism with simulated experiments, we find homodyne tomography to outperform heterodyne measurements for all non-Gaussian states tested, although the separation between the two modalities proves significantly narrower than suggested by the asymptotic Cramer-Rao lower bound. Our results should find use for optimizing measurement strategies in practical continuous-variable quantum systems.

Abstract: Squeezed light has revolutionized quantum metrology by enhancing interferometry for sensitive applications such as the detection of gravitational waves. Squeezed light has also played a pivotal role in quantum information science with numerous applications in quantum computing and communication. Previously, squeezed light has been primarily generated using nonlinear optical interactions, where control of the degree of squeezing was possible by tuning the nonlinearity of the generating medium using suitable material engineering. Here, we modulate the third-order nonlinear response in dielectrics with strong ultrafast laser fields to control the degree of squeezing on attosecond time scales. We demonstrate the ability to change the ultrafast squeezed light generated in the nonlinear process from amplitude-squeezed to phase-squeezed by controlling the strong-field-driven nonlinear response of the material through a sub-cycle phase delay between the input femtosecond laser pulses. The squeezing of quantum noise is measured using a frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection scheme capable of extracting the field quadratures in different frequency modes simultaneously. Using this frequency-resolved measurement we extract the complete coherency matrix containing the quantum correlations between field quadratures across different frequency modes of the femtosecond squeezed light pulse. These results have major implications for the development of quantum light sources with unprecedented levels of control over quadrature squeezing, for applications in multimode quantum information processing, and for measuring transient quantum matter correlations via transduction to quantum field correlations in an ultrafast light-matter interaction.

Abstract: This work presents the implementation of a fragment-based, quantum-centric supercomputing workflow for computing molecular electronic structure using quantum hardware. The workflow is applied to predict the relative energies of two conformers of the 300-atom Trp-cage miniprotein. The methodology employs wave function-based embedding (EWF) as the underlying fragmentation framework, in which all atoms in the system are explicitly included in the CI treatment. CI calculations for individual fragments are performed using either sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) for challenging fragments or full configuration interaction (FCI) for trivial fragments. To assess the accuracy of SQD for fragment CI calculations, EWF-(FCI,SQD) results are compared against EWF-MP2 and EWF-CCSD benchmarks. Overall, the results demonstrate that large-scale electronic configuration interaction (CI) simulations of protein systems containing hundreds or even thousands of atoms can be realized through the combined use of quantum and classical computing resources.

The method performs well on quantum hardware for 18- and 30-qubit Heisenberg chains and extends effectively to small 2D systems.

Conclusion: The study concludes that SKQD is an effective method for accurately determining ground-state energies and magnetization in Heisenberg models, even in strongly correlated regimes, and performs well on quantum hardware.

Abstract: We evaluate the Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) algorithm on one- and two-dimensional Heisenberg models, including strongly correlated regimes in which the ground state is dense. Using problem-informed initial states and magnetization-sector sweeps, SKQD accurately reproduces ground-state energies and field-dependent magnetization across a range of anisotropies. Benchmarks against DMRG and exact diagonalization show consistent qualitative agreement, with accuracy improving systematically in more anisotropic regimes. We further demonstrate SKQD on quantum hardware by implementing 18- and 30-qubit Heisenberg chains, obtaining magnetization curves that match theoretical expectations. Simulations on small 2D square-lattice systems further demonstrate that the method applies effectively beyond 1D geometries.

Abstract: High-quality quantum communications that enable important capabilities, such as distributed quantum computing and sensing, will require quantum repeaters for providing high-quality entanglement. To realize high-rate heralded entanglement for quantum repeaters, Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Appl. 19, 054209 (2023)] proposed a scheme for heralded-multiplexed generation of quasi-deterministic entangled photon pairs, called zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM). Here, we propose a design of ZALM source using time-bin entanglement and spectral shearing. Additionally, we provide an analysis of experimentally relevant spectral-shearing parameters to optimize the spectral multiplexing. Moreover, we experimentally verify the compatibility of time-bin pulses and spectral shearing, as supported by observation of no phase shift when the same shearing is applied to both time bins. These results expand the benefits of applying a ZALM source to time-bin entanglement use cases. Moreover, more fully demonstrating time-bin and spectral shearing compatibility clears a path towards a broader use of spectral shearing that provides a deterministic frequency shift of high utility.

Motivation: To address the challenge of exponential transmission loss in optical fibers for quantum networks by developing efficient quantum memories with multiplexing capabilities.

Method: The study utilized an Er3+:Y2SiO5 crystal at telecom wavelength, employing single-photon detectors to measure storage and recall of weak coherent pulses.

Result: The memory achieved a 1 ms storage time, 10.36% efficiency at 300 μs, and demonstrated storage of 20 temporal and 3 spectral modes simultaneously.

Conclusion: The experiment successfully demonstrated a quantum memory with extended storage times and large multimode capacities, essential for scalable quantum repeaters.

Abstract: The realization of scalable quantum networks for distribution of entanglement over long distances hinges on quantum repeaters. To outperform the exponential transmission loss in optical fibers, quantum repeaters must employ multiplexing schemes in the temporal, spectral, or spatial domain. The performance of such a multiplexed scheme is contingent on efficient quantum memories offering both extended storage times and large multimode capacities. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate such a memory operating at telecom wavelength using an Er$^{3+}$:Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ crystal. Using single-photon detectors, we record on-demand storage and recall of weak coherent pulses for up to $1$ ms, exceeding that of previously reported quantum memories based on Er$^{3+}$. The memory exhibits an efficiency of 10.36\% at 300 $μ$s storage time with a signal-to-noise ratio of $10.9$. We further showcase its multimode capacity by storing 20 temporal and 3 spectral modes simultaneously with on-demand and selective recall capabilities, essential for a scalable quantum repeater architecture.

Method: A novel time-resolving quantum receiver combined with a multi-mode probing signal is used to extract large-alphabet information modulated by a passive RIS.

Result: The technique surpasses the classical SQL for modulation sizes up to M = 2^8, while halving probing energy or increasing communication distance by 1.41x.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum receiver achieves significant improvements over classical receivers, demonstrating practical quantum advantages without complex quantum resources, and shows potential for broader adoption in passive backscatter systems.

Abstract: Information retrieval from passive backscatter systems is widely used in digital applications with tight energy budgets, short communication distances, and low data rates. Due to the fundamental limits of classical wireless receivers, the achievable data rate cannot be increased without compromising either energy efficiency or communication range, thereby hindering the broader adoption of this technology. In this work, we present a novel time-resolving quantum receiver combined with a multi-mode probing signal to extract large-alphabet information modulated by a passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The adaptive nature of the proposed receiver yields significant quantum advantages over classical receivers without relying on complex or fragile quantum resources such as entanglement. Simulation results show that the proposed technique surpasses the classical standard quantum limit (SQL) for modulation sizes up to M = 2^8, meanwhile halving the probing energy or increasing the communication distance by a factor of 1.41.

Abstract: Considering an $N$-level system interacting factorizably with a continuous spectrum, we derive analytical expressions for the bound states and the dynamical evolution within this single-excitation Friedrichs model by using the projection operator formalism. First, we establish explicit criteria to determine the number of bound states, whose existence suppresses the complete spontaneous decay of the system. Second, we derive the open system's dissipative dynamics, which is naturally described by an energy-independent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in the Markovian limit. As an example, we apply our framework to an atomic chain embedded in a photonic crystal waveguide, uncovering a rich variety of decay dynamics and realizing an anti-$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian in the system's evolution.

Motivation: To investigate the universal dynamics of dissipative quantum systems with dipole moment conservation, motivated by recent experimental advances.

Method: An effective field theory description and a concrete quantum spin model were developed to analyze the universal dynamics of dissipative quantum systems.

Result: Unveiled a novel strongly interacting non-equilibrium fixed point governing phase fluctuations, with charge transport being subdiffusive for strong dipole symmetry and diffusive for weak symmetry.

Conclusion: The results reveal the intricate interplay between kinetic constraints and dissipation in quantum many-body systems, highlighting the novel non-equilibrium fixed point and differing charge transport behaviors based on dipole symmetry strength.

Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains one of the grand challenges of modern physics. In particular, increasing attention has been devoted to the emergence of non-equilibrium universality classes that have no equilibrium counterparts. A prominent example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class realized in dissipative Bose-Einstein condensates. In this Letter, motivated by recent experimental advances, we investigate the universal dynamics of dissipative quantum systems with dipole moment conservation. We develop an effective field theory description, supported by a concrete quantum spin model, to capture the resulting universal behaviors. Our analysis unveils a novel strongly interacting non-equilibrium fixed point that governs the equal-time phase fluctuations in systems with either strong or weak dipole symmetries. Moreover, charge transport becomes subdiffusive in the presence of strong dipole symmetry, while it remains diffusive in the weakly symmetric case. Our results reveal the intricate interplay between kinetic constraints and dissipation in quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel edge-based encoding technique for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) on a quantum computer, reducing the required number of qubits. For implementation in real quantum devices, we applied the subspace reduction encoding to further reduce the dimension of the TSP solution space. We attack the TSP for 4-, 5-, and 6-city instances in both simulators and real quantum computers across different encoding frameworks. Optimal solutions of the 4-city TSP instance are obtained on state-of-the art IQM quantum computer. Our study presents a comparative analysis between edge-based encoding scheme and the node-based encoding methodology in the literature. Our findings indicate that the proposed encoding scheme outperforms conventional methods in terms of statistical measures, quantum resource utilization, and computational efficiency when applied to smaller TSP instances.

Motivation: To investigate the minimum uncertainty states associated with an information-theoretic refinement of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation in general spin systems, providing insights into quantumness and its applications.

Method: Two approaches were used: the matrix formulation and the Wick symbol representation, to derive explicit expressions for the states that saturate the uncertainty bound.

Result: Spin coherent states achieve minimum uncertainty, and additional classes of minimum uncertainty states beyond the coherent family are identified. Comparisons with the bosonic case reveal differences in the two settings.

Conclusion: The study concludes that spin coherent states achieve minimum uncertainty, consistent with their classical identification, and identifies additional classes of minimum uncertainty states. It also compares these findings with the bosonic case, explaining the differences.

Abstract: Minimum uncertainty states of the conventional Heisenberg uncertainty relation have been extensively studied and are often regarded as the most classical quantum states from the perspective of uncertainty, providing valuable insight into the nature of quantumness and its potential applications. In this work, we investigate the minimum uncertainty states associated with an information-theoretic refinement of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation in general spin systems. Using two different approaches, the matrix formulation and the Wick symbol representation, we derive explicit expressions for the states that saturate the uncertainty bound. We show that spin coherent states indeed achieve minimum uncertainty, consistent with their conventional identification as the classical states of spin systems. Moreover, we also identify additional classes of minimum uncertainty states beyond the coherent family. Finally, we compare the spin-system results with the previously studied bosonic case and elucidate the origin of the differences between the two settings.

TL;DR: The paper links quantum entanglement with spacetime emergence and gauge symmetries, proposing a dimensional reduction framework that mirrors the Standard Model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the emergence of spacetime and gauge symmetries from quantum entanglement, bridging quantum gravity and quantum information theory.

Method: The study associates entangled qubit systems with higher-dimensional spacetimes and demonstrates their dimensional reduction to 3+1 dimensions, revealing Standard Model gauge symmetries.

Result: The paper shows how entangled qubit systems correspond to higher-dimensional spacetimes, with dimensional reduction yielding the Standard Model gauge group and a possible explanation for the weak force's chirality.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a novel framework integrating quantum gravity and quantum information theory, suggesting that entangled qubit systems can explain the emergence of spacetime and gauge symmetries. It also hints at potential applications in quantum simulations of the Standard Model.

Abstract: Research at the intersection of quantum gravity and quantum information theory has seen significant success in describing the emergence of spacetime and gravity from quantum states whose entanglement entropy approximately obeys an area law. In a different direction, the Kaluza-Klein proposal aims to recover gauge symmetries by means of dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional gravitational theories. Integrating both, gravitational and gauge degrees of freedom in $3+1$ dimensions may be obtained upon dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional emergent gravity. To this end, we show that entangled systems of two and three qubits can be associated with $5+1$ and $9+1$ dimensional spacetimes respectively, which are reduced to $3+1$ dimensions upon singling out a preferred complex direction. In the latter case, this reduction is invariant under a residual $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) /\mathbb{Z}_6$ symmetry, the Standard Model gauge group. This motivates a picture in which spacetime emerges from the area law-contribution to the entanglement entropy, while gauge and matter degrees of freedom are due to area law-violating terms. We remark on a possible natural origin of the chirality of the weak force in the given construction. Furthermore, we highlight the possibility of using this construction in quantum simulations of Standard Model fields.

Abstract: Coincidence-count discrimination have turned utterly practical in the characterization of photon-pair processes and heralded single photons. Here, we implement a heralded single photon source based on parametric down-conversion (PDC) in a PP-KTP waveguide in the telecom wavelength range involving a low number of optical modes. We extend the toolbox for the loss-tolerant state characterization by combining conventional figures-of-merit in order to access the heralded state's mean photon number and its photon-number parity. Our experiment demonstrates that an accurate determination of these characteristics is possible just through simple photon-correlation measurements. We believe that our results can find usage in the calibrated creation of heralded single photons and in determining the expectation values of observables that are crucial for denoting a single quantum.

Abstract: Rydberg atom-based RF sensors offer distinct advantages over conventional dipole antennas for electric field detection.

Simulations show that the quantum radar achieves higher SNR and lower RMSE in velocity estimation than conventional radar.

Abstract: This work investigates single-photon scattering in a one-dimensional coupled-resonator waveguide coupled to a giant atom with a complex on-site energy. Within the generalized projection operator formalism, we derive analytical expressions for the scattering coefficients. We find that a lossy giant atom absorbs the incident wave, whereas a gain giant atom not only amplifies the incident wave but also leads to scattering divergence at certain energies, corresponding to spectral singularities. We explore the critical scattering dynamics associated with these singularities, and attribute the persistent wave emission to the existence of a stationary bound state in the continuum. Due to the presence of this bound state, the conventional time-independent scattering theory proves inadequate for such a non-Hermitian system. Furthermore, we show that the system with gain always features at least one time-growing bound state, which dominates the long-time dynamics, and we verify our time-dependent theoretical predictions via numerical simulations of Gaussian wave packet scattering.

Abstract: The efficient transfer of quantum states into a long-lived storage unit such as solid-state spin ensembles is widely recognized as a critical challenge with significant implications for quantum communication, sensing and computing applications. Here, we experimentally investigate the interaction of propagating squeezed microwaves with an electron spin resonance transition in order to evaluate the use of spin ensembles as quantum memories for GHz signals. We generate continuous variable microwave states with a squeezing of up to 5dB below the vacuum level and let this signal interrogate a spin ensemble, which is inductively coupled to a lumped element superconducting microwave resonator with a cooperativity of C=0.3. Analyzing this signal using Wigner tomography, we observe a transfer efficiency of around 61% between the squeezed microwaves and the spin excitation. We successfully model our experimental results with a dedicated steady-state model based on the quantum input-output formalism and provide guidance for design parameters required to enable spin-based quantum memories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a simple scheme for cooling a one-dimensional gas of microwave photons in a superconducting transmission line below typical dilution refrigerator temperatures.

Method: A nonlinear Josephson element is used to shunt one end of the transmission line to engineer a cooling mechanism that transfers photons from high- to low-frequency modes while preserving their total number.

Result: The system achieves a nonequilibrium steady state with potential sub-millikelvin temperatures and exhibits a novel condensation transition not seen in equilibrium scenarios.

Conclusion: The scheme can prepare photonic gases at sub-millikelvin temperatures and introduces a new type of condensation transition, with potential applications in quantum simulation schemes.

Abstract: We discuss a conceptually simple scheme for cooling a one dimensional gas of microwave photons in a superconducting transmission line. By shunting one end of the transmission line by a nonlinear Josephson element, we show how a cooling mechanism can be engineered that transfers photons from high- into low-frequency modes, while preserving their total number. We evaluate the resulting nonequilibrium steady state of the photon gas, which arises from a competition between this engineered cooling process and the natural, number non-conserving thermalization with the surrounding bath. Our analysis predicts that for realistic experimental parameters, this mechanism can be used to prepare photonic gases at sub-millikelvin temperatures, considerably below the typical base temperature of a dilution refrigerator. In addition, the system exhibits a new type of condensation transition that does not occur in the corresponding equilibrium scenario. As an outlook, we discuss potential applications of this cooling approach for quantum simulation schemes with interacting microwave photons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand what can be inferred about the bias class of a Boolean function using a fixed Universal QRAM interface, extending beyond perfect-discrimination cases like Deutsch-Jozsa.

Method: The study employs coherent, addressable queries to a quantum memory storing a Boolean function and analyzes the two-eigenspace structure of the induced single-query ensemble state.

Result: The paper shows that the single-copy Helstrom-optimal measurement and success probability can be derived in closed-form for exact-weight bias classes, leveraging the phase-bias magnitude for discrimination.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that a fixed Universal QRAM interface can discriminate Boolean memory configurations by analyzing the phase-bias magnitude of the quantum state, providing closed-form solutions for optimal measurement strategies.

Abstract: We study the discrimination of Boolean memory configurations via a fixed Universal QRAM (U-QRAM) interface. Given query access to a quantum memory storing an unknown Boolean function $f:[N]\to\{0,1\}$, we ask: what can be inferred about the bias class of $f$ (its imbalance from $1/2$, up to complement symmetry) using coherent, addressable queries? We show that for exact-weight bias classes, the induced single-query ensemble state on the address register has a two-eigenspace structure that yields closed-form expressions for the single-copy Helstrom-optimal measurement and success probability. Because complementing $f$ changes the state $|ψ\rangle$ only by a global phase, hypotheses $p$ and $1-p$ are information-theoretically identical in this model; thus the natural discriminand is the phase-bias magnitude $|μ|$ (equivalently $μ^2$). This goes beyond the perfect-discrimination case of Deutsch-Jozsa and complements exact-identification settings such as Bernstein-Vazirani.

Motivation: MDI-QKD eliminates detector side-channel attacks but requires precise temporal synchronization, which is challenging without auxiliary optical channels or shared clock references.

Method: The method utilizes round-trip optical pulse propagation and statistical signal detection in Gaussian noise conditions, deriving analytical expressions for false-alarm probabilities and quantifying detection reliability.

Result: Numerical modeling shows synchronization accuracy better than 10 ps for channel lengths up to 100 km with realistic optical power levels.

Conclusion: The proposed autonomous synchronization algorithm enhances the scalability and robustness of MDI-QKD networks, making it suitable for metropolitan and backbone quantum networks.

Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) eliminates detector side-channel attacks by relocating all measurements to an untrusted intermediate node. However, its practical implementation critically relies on picosecond-level temporal synchronization between spatially separated users. In this work, we present a physically motivated autonomous synchronization algorithm for fiber-based MDI-QKD networks that does not require auxiliary optical channels or shared clock references. The method exploits round-trip optical pulse propagation and statistical signal detection in the presence of Gaussian noise. We derive analytical expressions for false-alarm probabilities, quantify detection reliability, and demonstrate through numerical modeling that synchronization accuracy better than 10~ps is achievable for channel lengths up to 100~km with realistic optical power levels. The proposed approach improves the scalability and robustness of MDI-QKD architectures and is directly applicable to metropolitan and backbone quantum networks.

Abstract: Ge/SiGe heterostructures represent a promising platform for hosting various quantum devices such as hole spin qubits and Andreev spin qubits. However, the compatibility of such heterostructures with high-quality-factor microwave superconducting cavities remains a challenge due to defects in the material stack. In this work, we present an approach to enhance the coherence of cavity modes on a reverse-graded Ge/SiGe heterostructure, which consists of etching the full $\sim 1.6~\mathrm{μm}$-thick Ge/SiGe stack down to its starting high-resistivity Si substrate, in order to pattern superconducting cavities directly on it. We engineer the mesa step to be tapered, so that it can be easily climbed by the superconducting cavities to reach the quantum devices potentially hosted in the Ge quantum well. Using this approach, we observe internal quality factors of $Q_\mathrm{i} \approx 10000-20000$ for high-impedance frequency-tunable Josephson junction array resonators, limited by the junctions' fabrication, and $Q_\mathrm{i} \approx 100000$ for $50~\mathrmΩ$ coplanar waveguide Nb lift-off resonators. These $Q_\mathrm{i}$ are preserved despite the overlap with the mesa structure in the climbing region, and are comparable to the ones obtained for identical resonators fabricated on a high-resistivity Si wafer reference. Thereby, this work paves a practical path toward superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, immediately applicable to emerging technologies on planar Ge.

Abstract: We investigate a phase-controllable mechanism for generating optical torque in a five-level double-tripod (DT) atom-light coupling scheme interacting with four strong coherent control fields as well as two weak optical vortex probe beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM). The spatial phase gradients of the OAM-carrying probes induce a quantized torque that is transferred to the atoms, rotating them and generating a directed atomic flow within an annular geometry. Analytical solutions of the optical Bloch equations under steady-state conditions show that the induced torque and resulting rotational motion exhibit high sensitivity to phase variations. We show that the DT system coherently reconfigures into either coupled Λ or double-Λ schemes depending on the relative phases, with each configuration exhibiting distinct quantized torque characteristics. This enables precise phase control of the atomic current flow, with potential applications in quantum control, precision measurement, and quantum information processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the dynamics of closed quantum systems in the Bloch vector representation by leveraging classical mechanics concepts, aiming to establish integrability and stability criteria for quantum dynamics.

Method: The paper employs methods from rigid body dynamics and integrable systems theory to derive equations of motion for Bloch components from the von Neumann equation. It also uses the Heisenberg equation to form an Euler-Poinsot system, drawing connections to classical Hamiltonian models.

Result: The results include the derivation of integrable systems from quantum dynamics, stability criteria analogous to classical mechanics, and specific solutions for oscillating entangled states.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by demonstrating the physical relevance of the formalism through the derivation of an analogue of the intermediate axis theorem and the discussion of oscillating entanglement effects. It highlights the utility of the derived framework in predicting and analyzing quantum dynamics.

Abstract: This work investigates the dynamics of closed quantum systems in the Bloch vector representation using methods from rigid body dynamics and the theory of integrable systems. To this end, equations of motion for Bloch components are derived from the von Neumann equation, which are mathematically equivalent to equations of motion for a distribution of point masses from classical mechanics. Furthermore, using the Heisenberg equation, another system of Bloch vector equations is derived, which forms an Euler-Poinsot system, as is commonly encountered in the theory of torque-free spinning tops. This is used to prove the Liouville integrability of the corresponding Hamilton equations of motion, whereby formal connections to the Neumann model of classical Hamiltonian dynamics and the Hamiltonian Euler-Poinsot model are drawn to identify the first integrals of motion. Within the same framework, stability criteria for quantum dynamics are then derived which correspond to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion resp. other criteria following from the Energy-Casimir method of classical Newtonian mechanics. Following that, specific solutions to the equations of motion are constructed that encode the complex dynamics of composite quantum systems. Eventually, to show that this formalism provides concrete physical predictions, an analogue of the intermediate axis theorem is derived and the effect of oscillating entanglement is discussed. As a basis for this, special types of solutions to the equations of motion are derived that constitute oscillating entangled states, i.e., dynamical quantum states that change their entanglement structure from maximally entangled to separable and vice versa.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent rapid development of complexity theory applied to quantum mechanical processes we present the complete derivation of Nielsen's complexity of unitaries belonging to the representations of oscillator group. Our approach is based on the observation that the whole problem refers to the structure of the underlying group. The questions concerning the complexity of particular unitaries are solved by lifting the abstract structure to the operator level by considering the relevant unitary representation. For the class of right-invariant metrics obeying natural invariance condition we solve the geodesic equations on oscillator group. The solution is given explicitly in terms of elementary functions. Imposing the boundary conditions yield a transcendental equation and the length of the geodesic is given in terms of the solutions to the latter. Since the unitary irreducible representations of oscillator group are classified this allows us to compute, at least in principle, the complexity of any unitary operator belonging to the representation.

TL;DR: Study of a 3D spherical wedge model reveals non-integer angular momentum quantization and spectral reorganization under symmetry-breaking boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effects of symmetry-breaking boundary conditions on angular momentum quantization and spectral properties in constrained domains.

Method: Solving the stationary Schrödinger equation for a particle in a 3D spherical wedge with Dirichlet boundary conditions and analyzing the resulting spectral properties.

Result: 1. Stationary states are not eigenstates of angular momentum, showing genuine quantum uncertainty. 2. Azimuthal quantum numbers are non-integer, with hierarchical constraints. 3. Demonstration of how boundary conditions reorganize the Coulomb potential's spectrum.

Conclusion: The model provides insights into the roles of single-valuedness and polar regularity in the standard quantization of orbital angular momentum, demonstrating how boundary conditions can reorganize the spectrum.

Abstract: We solve the stationary Schrödinger equation for a particle confined to a 3D spherical wedge -- the region $\{(r,θ,φ): 0 \leq r \leq R,\, 0 \leq θ\leq π,\, 0 \leq φ\leq Φ\}$ with Dirichlet BCs on all surfaces. This exactly solvable constrained-domain model exhibits spectral reorganisation under symmetry-breaking BCs and provides an operator-domain viewpoint on angular momentum quantisation. We obtain three main results. First, the stationary states are standing waves in the azimuthal coordinate and consequently are \emph{not} eigenstates of $\hat{L}_z$; we prove $\langle L_z \rangle = 0$ with $ΔL_z = \hbar n_φπ/Φ\neq 0$, demonstrating that angular momentum projection becomes an observable with genuine quantum uncertainty rather than a good quantum number. Second, the effective azimuthal quantum number $μ= n_φπ/Φ$ is generically non-integer, and square-integrability of the polar wavefunctions at both poles requires the angular eigenvalue parameter $ν$ to satisfy $ν- μ\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. This regularity constraint yields a hierarchy: sectoral solutions ($ν= μ$, satisfying the first-order highest-weight condition) exist for any real $μ> 0$, while tesseral and zonal solutions require integer steps, appearing only when $μ$ itself is integer. Third, application to a Coulomb potential shows that the familiar integer angular momentum spectrum of hydrogen arises from the periodic identification $φ\sim φ+ 2π$ that defines the full-sphere Hilbert space domain; modified boundary conditions yield a reorganised spectrum with non-integer effective angular momentum. The model clarifies the distinct roles of single-valuedness (selecting integer $m$ via azimuthal topology) and polar regularity (selecting integer $\ell \geq |m|$ via analytic constraints) in the standard quantisation of orbital angular momentum.

We investigate two encoding methods that require fewer than one qubit per grid point: the previously developed Pauli correlation encoding (PCE) and a novel single-qubit operator encoding (SQOE). These methods are tested on three windfarm configurations - two from prior WFLO scaling studies and a new real-world model based on an existing windfarm in Wales. The improved encoding methods allow us to solve WFLO problems on $9\times 9$ grids using up to 20 qubits on a quantum computer simulator. The results show that both encoding methods perform competitively and demonstrate favorable scaling characteristics across the tested systems.

Abstract: Scaling superconducting quantum processors is fundamentally limited by the escalating complexity of cryogenic wiring and the debilitating effects of microwave crosstalk and Purcell decay. This paper proposes the concept of frequency-multiplexed millimeter-wave superconducting qubits and demonstrates a novel architecture that integrates an on-chip cryogenic nonreciprocal space-time-periodic superconducting frequency multiplier as a universal control bus for a frequency-multiplexed qubit array. The bus replaces multiple high-frequency XY drive lines with a single low-frequency input tone, which the multiplier converts into a comb of high-order harmonics, each resonantly addressing a distinct qubit. Crucially, the dynamic and nonreciprocal nature of the bus provides signal gain and intrinsic isolation that simultaneously suppresses Purcell decay, enhancing T1 times across all distinct-frequency qubits, and reduces coherent crosstalk by more than two orders of magnitude. The spatiotemporal modulation enables parametric frequency multiplication and creates wave-propagation dynamics analogous to cosmological expansion, with observed redshift-like broadening and deceleration of magnetic-field wavepackets. Theoretical modeling based on a non-Markovian master equation confirms that the engineered memory kernel extends coherence while reshaping the noise spectrum. Full error-budget analysis shows that the architecture maintains gate errors below the fault-tolerance threshold for arrays exceeding 25 qubits, converting a crosstalk-dominated error budget into one limited by intrinsic material coherence. This integrated, frequency-multiplexed, and nonreciprocal control bus therefore offers a path toward unprecedented I/O simplification, noise resilience, and scalable high-coherence quantum processin

Conclusion: 本研究通过构造一个明确的Lindbladian系统，证明了D～ħ^{4/3}是量子-经典对应性在Ehrenfest时间之后的阈值，解决了此前关于此问题的争论。

Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems, an initially localized quantum state can deviate strongly from the corresponding classical phase-space distribution after the Ehrenfest time $t_{\mathrm{E}} \sim \log(\hbar^{-1})$, even in the limit $\hbar \to 0$. Decoherence by the environment is often invoked to explain the persistence of the quantum-classical correspondence at longer timescales. Recent rigorous results for Lindblad dynamics with phase-space diffusion strength $D$ show that quantum and classical evolutions remain close for times that are exponentially longer than the Ehrenfest time whenever $D \gg \hbar^{\frac43}$, in units set by the classical Hamiltonian. At the same time, some heuristic arguments have suggested the weaker condition $D \gg \hbar^{2}$ always suffices. Here we construct an explicit Lindbladian that demonstrates that the scaling $D \sim \hbar^{\frac43}$ is indeed the threshold for quantum-classical correspondence beyond the Ehrenfest time. Our example uses a smooth time-dependent Hamiltonian and linear Lindblad operators generating homogeneous isotropic diffusion. It exhibits an $\hbar$-independent quantum-classical discrepancy at the Ehrenfest time whenever $D \ll \hbar^{\frac43}$, even for $\hbar$-independent "macroscopic" smooth observables.

Abstract: The advent of high-intensity ultrafast laser pulses has opened new opportunities for controlling and designing quantum materials. In particular, terahertz (THz) pulses can resonantly drive optical phonon modes, enabling dynamic manipulation of lattice degrees of freedom. In this work, we investigate the ultrafast quantum thermodynamics of optical phonon mode driven by a THz pulse by treating the phonon as an open quantum system coupled to a thermal environment within a Caldeira-Leggett-type framework. We derive the quantum heat current between the phonon and the bath and analyze its behavior under realistic pulse protocols. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast laser driving can reveal and even induce significant deviations from the commonly adopted Markovian approximation, thereby providing a pathway to probe and control non-Markovian dissipation in driven solid-state systems.

Abstract: Entanglement is central to quantum theory, yet detecting it reliably in non-Gaussian systems remains a long-standing challenge. In continuous-variable platforms, inseparability tests based on Gaussian statistics - such as those of Duan and Simon - fail when quantum correlations are encoded in higher moments of the field quadratures. Here we introduce an inseparability criterion that exposes non-Gaussian entanglement that escapes covariance-based criteria by incorporating higher-order quadrature cumulants. The criterion extends Gaussian theory without requiring full state tomography and can be evaluated directly from homodyne and heterodyne data and is possible to extend to arbitrary superpositions of Fock states in two modes. This provides an experimentally viable approach for identifying non-Gaussian resources in continuous-variable platforms.

Abstract: Digital-analog quantum computing with two-level systems is a computational paradigm that combines an analog Hamiltonian with single-qubit gates to achieve universality. We extend this framework to $d$-level systems by conjugating an analog Hamiltonian block with single-qudit gates drawn from the Weyl-Heisenberg basis, which provides a natural set of operations for qudit architectures. More specifically, we propose a protocol to simulate arbitrary two-body Hamiltonians with at most $O(d^4 n^2)$ analog blocks. The power of this approach is illustrated by the simulation of many-body qudit spin Hamiltonians including magnetic quadrupolar terms.

Motivation: To address the lack of general methods for computing inclusion constants in free spectrahedra, despite their importance in quantifying the quality of relaxations for spectrahedral inclusion problems.

Method: Utilized non-commutative polynomial optimization and detailed analysis of extreme points of free spectrahedra.

Result: Developed a method to compute inclusion constants for Cartesian products of free simplices, yielding new analytic expressions. Applied results to quantum information theory, proving new bounds on white noise tolerance for incompatible measurements.

Conclusion: The paper provides a method to compute inclusion constants for Cartesian products of free simplices using non-commutative polynomial optimization and analysis of extreme points. It also derives new closed-form expressions for these constants and applies them to quantum information theory, specifically to bound the white noise tolerance of incompatible measurements.

Abstract: Building on the matrix cube problem, inclusions of free spectrahedra have been used successfully to obtain relaxations of hard spectrahedral inclusion problems. The quality of such a relaxation is quantified by the inclusion constant associated with each free spectrahedron. While optimal values of inclusion constants were known in certain highly symmetric cases, no general method for computing them was available. In this work, we show that inclusion constants for Cartesian products of free simplices can be computed using methods from non-commutative polynomial optimization, together with a detailed analysis of the extreme points of the associated free spectrahedra. This analysis also yields new closed-form analytic expressions for these constants. As an application to quantum information theory, we prove new bounds on the amount of white noise that incompatible measurements can tolerate before they become compatible. In particular, we study the case of one dichotomic and one $k$-outcome measurement, as well as the case of four dichotomic qubit measurements.

Abstract: Semidefinite relaxations of polynomial optimization have become a central tool for addressing the non-convex optimization problems over non-commutative operators that are ubiquitous in quantum information theory and, more in general, quantum physics. Yet, as these global relaxation methods rely on floating-point methods, the bounds issued by the semidefinite solver can - and often do - exceed the global optimum, undermining their certifiability. To counter this issue, we introduce a rigorous framework for extracting exact rational bounds on non-commutative optimization problems from numerical data, and apply it to several paradigmatic problems in quantum information theory. An extension to sparsity and symmetry-adapted semidefinite relaxations is also provided and compared to the general dense scheme. Our results establish rational post-processing as a practical route to reliable certification, pushing semidefinite optimization toward a certifiable standard for quantum information science.

Abstract: We derive the continuous spacetime limit of the one dimensional lazy discrete time quantum walk, obtaining explicit macroscopic evolution equations for a three state model in the presence of decoherence. While continuum limits of two state quantum walks are well established, an explicit continuous spacetime formulation for the lazy three state walk, particularly including noise, has not previously been constructed. Using an SU(3) representation of a Grover type coin together with a Lindblad formulation of decoherence acting either on the coin or the spatial subspace, we systematically expand the discrete dynamics in both space and time to obtain continuum master equations governing the coarse grained evolution. The resulting generators yield a genuine partial differential equation description of the walk, going beyond purely probabilistic or spectral correspondences. We show that the unitary limit is governed by a Dirac-type SU(3) Hamiltonian describing ballistic advection of left and right moving modes coupled by local symmetric mixing, with the rest state acting as an additional internal degree of freedom. Coin dephasing selectively damps internal coherences while preserving coherent spatial transport, whereas spatial dephasing suppresses long range spatial interference and rapidly drives the dynamics toward classical behaviour. This continuum framework clarifies how internal symmetry, rest state coupling, and distinct decoherence channels shape large scale transport in lazy open quantum walks, and provides a foundation for future extensions toward multichannel quantum transport models and quantum-inspired algorithms.

Motivation: To address the computational challenges in modular arithmetic by demonstrating quantum comparison of integer pairs, a fundamental arithmetic operation.

Method: Utilizing the Reimei quantum computer's trapped-ion architecture with all-to-all qubit connectivity and high gate fidelities to compare integer pairs.

Result: High success probabilities were observed for bit widths n = 3, 5, 7, and 9, with 95% success under conventional criteria and 69% under stricter criteria at n=9.

Conclusion: The demonstration of reliable quantum comparison at scales far beyond previous experimental achievements showcases the potential of quantum computing for arithmetic operations.

Abstract: Quantum computers are believed to solve a class of computational problems that are based on modular arithmetic faster than classical computers. Among the arithmetic building blocks, comparison of integer pairs is a primitive. Here we report its demonstration in the Reimei quantum computer at RIKEN, whose trapped-ion architecture provides all-to-all qubit connectivity together with high gate fidelities. We observe high success probabilities for bit widths n = 3, 5, 7, and 9: Under a conventional output-only success criterion we obtain 95% at n=9; under a stricter criterion additionally requiring the ancilla to be correct, the success is 69% at n=9. These results demonstrate reliable quantum comparison at scales far beyond those previously achieved experimentally, not only for comparators but also in the broader context of quantum arithmetic circuits.

Motivation: To explore methods for reducing transfer errors in quantum systems during adiabatic evolution, especially around quantum phase transitions, by optimizing the scheduling functions of the Hamiltonian.

Method: Numerical calculations and simulations on a Rydberg atom quantum simulator, focusing on the adiabatic evolution of many-body quantum systems. The study examines a one-dimensional mixed-field Ising model and a chain of Rydberg atoms, comparing results with different schedule functions.

Result: The infidelity with respect to the final adiabatic eigenstate scales as $1/T^{n+1}$ when the time-dependent Hamiltonian is $n$ times differentiable with vanishing $1^{st}$ to $n^{th}$ order derivatives at the boundaries, indicating significant error suppression.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that using smooth scheduling functions for the Hamiltonian can effectively suppress the end-to-end transfer error in quantum simulators, particularly around quantum phase transitions.

Abstract: We present numerical calculations, and simulations performed on a Rydberg atom quantum simulator, of the adiabatic evolution of many-body quantum systems around a quantum phase transition. We demonstrate that the end-to-end transfer error, for a given process duration and dissipative losses, can be suppressed by adopting smooth initial and final scheduling functions for the Hamiltonian. We consider a one-dimensional mixed-field Ising model, as well as a chain of Rydberg atoms, and compare numerical calculations and experimental results for the end-to-end transfer error with different schedule functions. We show, in particular, that if the time dependent Hamiltonian is $n$ times differentiable with vanishing $1^{st}$ to $n^{th}$ order derivatives in the beginning and in the end, the infidelity with respect to the final adiabatic eigenstate scales as $1/T^{n+1}$ when evolving for time $T$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-Gaussian states are essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing and enhanced metrology, but their generation is typically faint and post-selective. This work aims to deterministically generate bright non-Gaussian states.

Method: The authors introduced a Kerr nonlinearity to bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) and used a single-shot f-2f interferometer to sample the Husimi function for state characterization.

Result: The study observed a clear transformation from a 2D Gaussian distribution to an 'S'-shaped non-Gaussian profile, indicating intensity-dependent nonlinear phase. While Wigner-function negativity is not directly observable, the work shows that BSV can be considered a mixture of squeezed coherent states with Kerr-induced negativity tolerant to loss.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the deterministic generation of bright non-Gaussian states using Kerr nonlinearity in bright squeezed vacuum (BSV), bridging quantum optics and ultrafast nonlinear optics. It opens new possibilities for quantum applications requiring high photon flux.

Abstract: Non-Gaussian states of light are a critical resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing and enhanced metrology, but are typically faint and often obtained via post-selection. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic generation of a bright non-Gaussian state by introducing a Kerr nonlinearity to a macroscopic state of light called bright squeezed vacuum (BSV). To characterize the resulting state, we use a single-shot f-2f interferometer to sample its Husimi function. We observe a clear transformation from a 2D Gaussian distribution to an 'S'-shaped non-Gaussian profile, which is the direct statistical evidence of the intensity-dependent nonlinear phase. The negativity of the Wigner function, which is an intrinsic property of any pure non-Gaussian state, cannot be observed because BSV is a mixed state even under minute optical loss. However, we show that BSV can be considered as a mixture of pure squeezed coherent states, for some of which Kerr-induced Wigner-function negativity is quite tolerant to loss. This work bridges the gap between quantum optics and ultrafast nonlinear optics, opening a path to quantum applications that require high photon flux.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of designing PQCs for QML on NISQ devices by balancing expressiveness, trainability, and noise robustness.

Method: The design employs interleaved encode-entangle-train cycles with locality-preserving information flow, focusing on short-range correlations and reducing long-range two-qubit operations.

Result: DAQC performs competitively with classical models like ResNet-18/50 and significantly better than QCS baselines on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and PneumoniaMNIST datasets.

Conclusion: DAQC achieves competitive performance with classical baselines and outperforms Quantum Circuit Search baselines on real quantum hardware, marking the best reported performance for QML-based image classification tasks.

Abstract: Designing parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) that are expressive, trainable, and robust to hardware noise is a central challenge for quantum machine learning (QML) on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We present a Domain-Aware Quantum Circuit (DAQC) that leverages image priors to guide locality-preserving encoding and entanglement via non-overlapping DCT-style zigzag windows. The design employs interleaved encode-entangle-train cycles, where entanglement is applied among qubits hosting neighboring pixels, aligned to device connectivity. This staged, locality-preserving information flow expands the effective receptive field without deep global mixing, enabling efficient use of limited depth and qubits. The design concentrates representational capacity on short-range correlations, reduces long-range two-qubit operations, and encourages stable optimization, thereby mitigating depth-induced and globally entangled barren-plateau effects. We evaluate DAQC on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and PneumoniaMNIST datasets. On quantum hardware, DAQC achieves performance competitive with strong classical baselines (e.g., ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) and substantially outperforming Quantum Circuit Search (QCS) baselines. To the best of our knowledge, DAQC, which uses a quantum feature extractor with only a linear classical readout (no deep classical backbone), currently achieves the best reported performance on real quantum hardware for QML-based image classification tasks.

Motivation: The quantum Wasserstein distance is expected to have applications in quantum state discrimination and quantum metrology, motivating the need for a general formula for Gaussian states.

Method: Following the formalism introduced by De Palma and Trevisan, the authors compute the optimal transport plan between two quantum states and derive a general formula for the Wasserstein distance for one-mode Gaussian states.

Result: The authors present a general formula for the Wasserstein distance between one-mode Gaussian states, which can recover classical Gaussian distributions and thermal states as special cases.

Conclusion: This work provides a general formula for the Wasserstein distance of order 2 between any two one-mode Gaussian states, extending previous results and enabling direct comparison with other distance measures.

Abstract: Optimal transport between classical probability distributions has been proven useful in areas such as machine learning and random combinatorial optimization. Quantum optimal transport, and the quantum Wasserstein distance as the minimal cost associated with transforming one quantum state to another, is expected to have implications in quantum state discrimination and quantum metrology. In this work, following the formalism introduced in [De Palma, G. and Trevisan, D. Ann. Henri Poincaré, {\bf 22} (2021), 3199-3234] to compute the optimal transport plan between two quantum states, we give a general formula for the Wasserstein distance of order 2 between any two one-mode Gaussian states. We discuss how the Wasserstein distance between classical Gaussian distributions and the quantum Wasserstein distance by De Palma and Trevisan for thermal states can be recovered from our general formula for Gaussian states. This opens the path to directly compare various known distance measures with the Wasserstein distance through their closed-form solutions.

Abstract: We introduce an entanglement witness that identifies off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) -- a distinctive form of entanglement -- in systems containing both fermionic and bosonic particles. By analyzing the particle-hole reduced density matrices of each subsystem, the approach detects ODLRO independently in both fermionic and bosonic sectors and identifies when long-range order develops across the entire mixed-particle system. The witness also quantifies the magnitude of ODLRO within each particle type, revealing how fermionic and bosonic correlations combine to form the total entanglement of the system, including a bosonic condensation of particle-hole pairs driven by many-body correlations rather than particle statistics. Using the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick spin model, we show how the transition from ODLRO localized to one particle type to ODLRO shared by both particle types captures the onset of collective entanglement in a mixed-particle environment, providing new insight into systems where fermionic and bosonic correlations coexist.

Abstract: Realizing and controlling the unconventional pairing featured by topological superconductors remains a central challenge. We introduce a cavity QED quantum simulator that engineers competing chiral $p_x+ip_y$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ orders by tailoring cavity-mediated couplings between atomic pseudospins that emulate momentum-dependent pairing channels. The desired spatially inhomogeneous cavity-mediated couplings can be engineered in a 2D optical lattice using incommensurate cavity-lattice wavelengths naturally occurring in cavity QED systems. This minimal and fully tunable platform enables controlled state preparation and continuous measurement of superconducting order parameters, revealing phases in both equilibrium and sudden-quench settings with a single dominant pairing channel, as well as coexistence regimes with competing pairing channels. Crucially, our implementation allows direct observation of topological transitions in and out of equilibrium, providing a powerful route to the quantum simulation of competing topological superconducting phases that remain elusive in solid-state and ultracold-atom systems.

Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) use neural networks to represent wavefunctions of quantum many-body systems, but their performance depends on the choice of basis, yet the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. We use a fully solvable one-dimensional Ising model to show that local basis rotations leave the loss landscape unchanged while relocating the exact wavefunction in parameter space, effectively increasing its geometric distance from typical initializations. By sweeping a rotation angle, we compute quantum Fisher information and Fubini-Study distances to quantify how the rotated wavefunction moves within the loss landscape. Shallow architectures (with focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)) trained with quantum natural gradient are more likely to fall into saddle-point regions depending on the rotation angle: they achieve low energy error but fail to reproduce correct coefficient distributions. In the ferromagnetic case, near-degenerate eigenstates create high-curvature barriers that trap optimization at intermediate fidelities. We introduce a framework based on an analytically solvable rotated Ising model to investigate how relocating the target wavefunction within a fixed loss landscape exposes information-geometric barriers,such as saddle points and high-curvature regions,that hinder shallow NQS optimization, underscoring the need for landscape-aware model design in variational training.

Abstract: Many optical measurement techniques, such as light scattering from wavelength-scale particles or detecting motion from a surface with an optical lever, encode information in a complex radiation pattern. Extracting all available information is essential for many quantum-enhanced sensing protocols but is often impractical, as it requires many channels to spatially resolve the scattered signal. We present a new method to visualize how efficiently a practical measurement scheme captures the information available in the scattered light by mapping out the local contribution to the detection efficiency on the detector surface. We use this tool to experimentally optimize the free space measurement of the amplitude of motion of an optomechanical resonator with a quadrant photodiode. We show that blocking sections of the photodetector enhances sensitivity, counterintuitively yielding a significant improvement in detecting higher-order mechanical modes in the system. We also show how our method can be applied to light scattering measurements of small particles.
