Abstract: Creating precise timing devices at ultra-short time scales is not just an important technological challenge, but confronts us with foundational questions about timekeeping's ultimate precision limits. Research on clocks has either focused on long-term stability using an oscillator stabilized by a level transition, limiting precision at short timescales, or on making individual stochastic ticks as precise as possible. Here, we prove the viability of a conceptually different avenue: the autonomous self-correction of consecutive ticks by quantum correlations. This provides a new paradigm that integrates the advantages and insights from quantum transport theory to operate clocks at ultra-short timescales. We fully solve a model of coupled quantum systems and show how the emergent Pauli exclusion principle correlates the clock at the quantum level yielding an exponential advantage in precision. We furthermore demonstrate through simulations with realistic imperfections that this remarkable gain in precision remains stable providing a roadmap for implementation with contemporary quantum technologies.

Abstract: Biased-noise qubits, in which one type of error (e.g. $X$- and $Y$-type errors) is significantly suppressed relative to the other (e.g. $Z$-type errors), can significantly reduce the overhead of quantum error correction. Codes such as the rectangular surface code or XZZX code substantially reduce the qubit overhead under biased noise, but they still face challenges. The rectangular surface code suffers from a relatively low threshold, while the XZZX code requires twice as many physical qubits to maintain the same code distance as the surface code. In this work, we introduce a 2D local code construction that outperforms these codes for noise biases $η\ge 7\times10^{4}$, reducing the qubit overhead by over 50% at $p_Z=10^{-3}$ and $η= 2 \times 10^6$ to achieve a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$. Our construction relies on the concatenation of two classical codes. The inner codes are repetition phase-flip codes while the outer codes are high-rate bit-flip codes enabled by their implementation at the logical level, which circumvents device connectivity constraints. These results indicate that under sufficiently biased noise, it is advantageous to address phase-flip and bit-flip errors at different layers of the coding scheme. The inner code should prioritize a high threshold for phase-flip errors, while the bit-flip outer code should optimize for encoding rate efficiency. In the strong biased-noise regime, high-rate outer codes keep the overhead for correcting residual bit-flip errors comparable to that of the repetition code itself, meaningfully lower than that required by earlier approaches.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of an extended non-equilibrium critical phase, characterized by sub-exponential decay of conditional mutual information (CMI), in the surface code subject to heralded random Pauli measurement channels. By mapping the resulting mixed state to the ensemble of completely packed loops on a square lattice, we relate the extended phase to the Goldstone phase of the loop model. In particular, CMI is controlled by the characteristic length scale of loops, and we use analytic results of the latter to establish polylogarithmic decay of CMI in the critical phase. We find that the critical phase retains partial logical information that can be recovered by a global decoder, but not by any quasi-local decoder. To demonstrate this, we introduce a diagnostic called punctured coherent information which provides a necessary condition for quasi-local decoding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) have attracted considerable interest due to their role in weak ergodicity breaking in many-body systems. We present a general construction that embeds stabilizer states as QMBS of local Hamiltonians. The method relies on a notion of factorizability of Pauli strings on a lattice, which is used to convert stabilizer elements into local, few-body operators that annihilate the stabilizer state. This enables the systematic construction of parent Hamiltonians with zero-energy stabilizer QMBS typically near the middle of the spectrum. The method reproduces several known results in a unified framework, including recent examples of volume-law entangled QMBS, such as the ``rainbow'' QMBS and the entangled antipodal Bell pair state. We also apply the framework to construct examples of stabilizer QMBS with a more complex entanglement structure, such as the cluster state, the toric code state, and a volume-law entangled state we dub the antipodal toric code (ATC) state. Exact diagonalization confirms our results and reveal the stabilizer states as exact eigenstates of their parent Hamiltonian.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We reconsider the quantum energetics and quantum thermodynamics of the charging process of a simple, two-component quantum battery model made up of a charger qubit and a single--cell battery qubit. We allow for the initial quantum state of the charger to lie anywhere on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and find the generalized analytical expressions describing the stored energy, ergotropy and capacity of the battery, all of which depend upon the initial Bloch sphere polar angle in a manner evocative of the quantum area theorem. The origin of the ergotropy produced, as well as the genesis of the battery capacity, can be readily traced back to the quantum coherences and population inversions generated (and the balance between these two mechanisms is contingent upon the starting Bloch polar angle). Importantly, the ergotropic charging power and its associated optimal charging time display notable deviations from standard results which disregard thermodynamic considerations. Our theoretical groundwork may be useful for guiding forthcoming experiments in quantum energy science based upon coupled two-level systems.

Abstract: The quantum Fourier transform and quantum wavelet transform have been cornerstones of quantum information processing. However, for non-stationary signals and anomaly detection, the Hilbert transform can be a more powerful tool, yet no prior work has provided efficient quantum implementations for the discrete Hilbert transform. This letter presents a novel construction for a quantum Hilbert transform in polylogarithmic size and logarithmic depth for a signal of length $N$, exponentially fewer operations than classical algorithms for the same mapping. We generalize this algorithm to create any $d$-dimensional Hilbert transform in depth $O(d\log N)$. Simulations demonstrate effectiveness for tasks such as power systems control and image processing, with exact agreement with classical results.

Abstract: We introduce a two-tooth bosonic quantum comb that captures the sequential interactions between a thermal absorber and a long-lived coherent probe. The comb provides a causal, multi-time description of coherence transport, tracking how the probe records both instantaneous fluctuations and their temporal correlations. Using a process-tensor formulation, we derive closed form expressions showing that interference between the two interaction windows generates a non-monotonic memory response that reflects a fundamental competition between the absorbers thermal population and its dynamical correlations. By sweeping the temporal separation between the interaction windows, the probe directly samples the absorbers population correlator, enabling bosonic noise spectroscopy that discriminates Markovian temperature noise from slow or spectrally structured fluctuations. The approach is readily compatible with circuit-QED platforms and offers a general method for probing fluctuating bosonic environments.

Abstract: Quantum trajectories are dynamical equations for quantum states conditioned on the results of a time-continuous measurement, such as a continuous-in-time current $\vec y_t$. Recently there has been renewed interest in dynamical maps for quantum trajectories with time-intervals of finite size $Δt$. Guilmin \emph{et al.} (unpublished) derived such a dynamical map for the (experimentally relevant) case where only the average current $I_t$ over each interval is available. Surprisingly, this binned data still generates a conditioned state $ρ_\text{\faFaucet}$ that is almost pure (for efficient measurements), with an impurity scaling as $(Δt)^{3}$. We show that, nevertheless, the typical distance of $ρ_\text{\faFaucet}$ from $\hatψ_{\text{F}; \vec y_t}$ -- the projector for the pure state conditioned on the full current -- is as large as $(Δt)^{3/2}$. We introduce another finite-interval dynamical map (``$Φ$-map''), which requires only one additional real statistic, $φ_t$, of the current in the interval, that gives a conditioned state $\hatψ_Φ$ which is only $(Δt)^{2}$-distant from $\hatψ_{\text{F}; \vec y_t}$. We numerically verify these scalings of the error (distance from the true states) for these two maps, as well as for the lowest-order (Itô) map and two other higher-order maps. Our results show that, for a generic system, if the statistic $φ_t$ can be extracted from experiment along with $I_t$, then the $Φ$-map gives a smaller error than any other.

Abstract: The dynamics of quantum systems are generally described by a family of quantum channels (linear, completely positive and trace preserving maps). In this note, we mainly study the range of all possible values of $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2^2+\|\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}\|_2^2$ for quantum channels $\mathcal{E}$ and give the equivalent characterizations for quantum channels that achieve these maximum and minimum values, respectively, where $\|\mathcal{E}\|_2$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of $\mathcal{E}$ and $\widetilde{\mathcal{E}}$ is a complementary channel of $\mathcal{E}.$ Also, we get a concrete description of completely positive maps on infinite dimensional systems preserving pure states. Moreover, the equivalency of several matrix integrals over the unit sphere is demonstrated and some extensions of these matrix integrals are obtained.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the two-time Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities of a quantum optical model that appears in the Josephson-junction quantum bit (qubit) interacting with an external magnetic flux. This model is a natural extension of an exactly solvable model whose interaction between a qubit and single-mode photons is given by a product of the Pauli $z$ operator of the qubit and a linear combination of annihilation and creation operators of the photons. By contrast, a photon's part of the interaction of our model is given by the square of the linear combination. Because our model is not solvable, we approximately investigate its time evolution up to the second-order perturbation. Our numerical calculations show that violation of the LG inequality diminishes as the temperature increases. Moreover, it exhibits power laws of the temperature, whose exponents vary depending on the coupling constant of the interaction between the qubit and photons. The violation of the LG inequality decreases and becomes less sensitive to the temperature as the coupling constant of the interaction gets larger.

Abstract: Superconducting quantum circuits derive their nonlinearity from the Josephson energy-phase relation. Besides the fundamental $\cosφ$ term, this relation can also contain higher Fourier harmonics $\cos(kφ)$ corresponding to correlated tunneling of $k$ Cooper pairs. The parity of the dominant tunneling process, i.e.~whether an odd or even number of Cooper pairs tunnel, results in qualitatively different properties, and controlling this opens up a wide range of applications in superconducting technology. However, access to even-dominated regimes has remained challenging and has so far relied on complex multi-junction or all-hybrid architectures. Here, we demonstrate a simple "harmonic parity qubit" (HPQ); an element that combines two aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions in parallel to a gate-tunable InAs/Al nanowire junction forming a SQUID, and use spectroscopy versus flux to reconstruct its energy-phase relation at 85 gate voltage points. At half flux quantum, the odd harmonics of the Josephson potential can be suppressed by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the even harmonics, producing a double-well potential dominated by even harmonics with minima near $\pmπ/2$. The ability to control harmonic parity enables supercurrent carried by pairs of Cooper pairs and provides a new building block for Fourier engineering in superconducting circuits.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation allows quantum computations to be carried out while resisting unwanted noise. Several error correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures known for their robustness against perturbations. Their topological stability makes them robust information carriers, ideal for tackling a key challenge in quantum computing: creating reliable, one-way links between different types of qubits. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce a novel device - the skyrmion quantum diode - based on skyrmion qubits. Our approach combines classical micromagnetic simulations, achieving skyrmion diameters as small as 3 nm, with quantum circuit models inspired by superconducting qubits. In this work, we demonstrate: (i) unidirectional skyrmion transport via the skyrmion Hall effect in asymmetric junctions, spanning length scales from 20 nm down to 3 nm; (ii) potential compatibility with flux-tunable quantum architectures; and (iii) preliminary insights into anharmonicity in skyrmion-based qubit systems. These results establish both the operational feasibility and the scaling behavior necessary for a hybrid skyrmion-quantum platform. Our work outlines a path toward integrating skyrmion based quantum components into practical device architectures, enabling low-dissipation, unidirectional quantum information transport. This capability is crucial for scalable quantum computing, spintronic logic, and hybrid quantum systems, and opens opportunities for chipscale, pump-free isolators and directional quantum links that enhance readout fidelity, reduce cryogenic load, and support modular skyrmion-superconducting processors

Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) has emerged to automate the design of high-performance quantum circuits under specific tasks and hardware constraints. We propose a noise-aware quantum architecture search (NA-QAS) framework based on variational quantum circuit design. By incorporating a noise model into the training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) , the proposed framework identifies the noise-robust architectures. We introduce a hybrid Hamiltonian $\varepsilon$ -greedy strategy to optimize evaluation costs and circumvent local optima. Furthermore, an enhanced variable-depth NSGA-II algorithm is employed to navigate the vast search space, enabling an automated trade-off between architectural expressibility and quantum hardware overhead. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through binary classification and iris multi-classification tasks under a noisy condition. Compared to existing approaches, our framework can search for quantum architectures with superior performance and greater resource efficiency under a noisy condition.

Abstract: We study the nonlocal advantage of quantum imaginarity (NAQI) and distillable imaginarity of assistance (DIA), which treat imaginarity as a resource in distributed scenarios. For two qubits interacting with a lossy cavity, it is shown that both the NAQI and DIA can be well preserved for long times in the presence of large and symmetric detuning between the qubits and the cavity. Moreover, the off-resonant interaction generates a high degree of NAQI and DIA from the initial product states of two qubits having the same detunings and unequal couplings to the cavity. Based on the effective coupling of the qubits induced by the cavity mode, we explain the physical mechanism underlying the validity of this strategy. Our findings shed light on the role that off-resonant interactions have in the efficient control of imaginarity in distributed scenarios.

By utilizing local pseudorandom unitaries, we ensure the worst case can be transformed into the average-case with high probability. This work establishes a scalable approach to high-dimensional entanglement certification and introduces a proof framework for random Pauli sampling.

Abstract: Qubits that experience predominantly erasure errors offer distinct advantages for fault-tolerant operation. Indeed, dual-rail encoded erasure qubits in superconducting cavities and transmons have demonstrated high-fidelity operations by converting physical-qubit relaxation into logical-qubit erasures, but this comes at the cost of increased hardware overhead and circuit complexity. Here, we address these limitations by realizing erasure conversion in a single fluxonium operated at zero flux, where the logical state is encoded in its 0-2 subspace. A single, carefully engineered resonator provides both mid-circuit erasure detection and end-of-line (EOL) logical measurement. Post-selection on non-erasure outcomes results in more than four-fold increase of the logical lifetime, from $193~μ$s to $869~μ$s. Finally, we characterize measurement-induced logical dephasing as a function of measurement power and frequency, and infer that each erasure check contributes a negligible error of $7.2\times 10^{-5}$. These results establish integer-fluxonium as a promising, resource-efficient platform for erasure-based error mitigation, without requiring additional hardware.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for quantum key distribution (QKD) using orbital angular momentum (OAM) encoded BB84 on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. A unified channel model captures Kolmogorov turbulence, pointing induced misalignment, and finite aperture clipping, enabling quantitative predictions of inter mode crosstalk and the resulting quantum bit error rate (QBER). Using a weak plus vacuum decoy state formulation, we derive composable finite key lower bounds on the secret key rate that incorporate statistical fluctuations, detector dark counts, efficiency mismatch, and error correction leakage. To stabilize performance under non stationary flight conditions, we introduce a lightweight physics informed learning module that combines physical priors with measured link statistics to classify valid pulses, reject corrupted data, and recommend decoding strategies. We outline a complete evaluation pipeline including UAV system architecture, turbulence driven QBER maps, decoy optimization, finite key scaling, and AI calibration metrics. Simulations indicate that under moderate turbulence and milliradian level pointing jitter, the proposed AI assisted method can improve the secret key rate by 10 percent to 30 percent while preserving composable security.

Abstract: We investigate the formation of three-body bound states in the continuum by tracing pole trajectories in the complex energy plane under variation of system parameters. Using a one-dimensional model of two identical bosons and a distinguishable particle interacting via Gaussian potentials, we systematically vary the interaction strength, interaction range, and mass ratio. Our results confirm the parametric nature of few-body bound states in a continuum (BIC) and extend this characterization to a broader set of system parameters. Specifically, we find that variations of both interaction parameters and the mass ratio can lead to the formation of at least one three-body BIC. However, the exact shape of trajectories differs, and for the mass ratio variation we find a more regular pattern with multiple BIC locations. These results suggest that the mechanism of few-body BIC formation is more sensitive to the kinematic structure of the problem than to the specific details of the two-body interaction.

Abstract: The rate of coherence loss is lower for a qubit under Rabi drive compared to a freely evolving qubit, $T_{2}^{\rm{Rabi}}>T_{2}^*$.
  Building on this principle, concatenated continuous driving (CCD) keeps the qubit under continuous drive to suppress noise and manipulate dressed states by either phase or amplitude modulation.
  In this work, we propose a new variant of CCD which simultaneously modulates both the amplitude and phase of the driving field to generate a circularly-polarized field in the rotating frame of the carrier frequency.
  This circular-modulated (CM)-CCD cancels the counter-rotating term in the second rotating frame, eliminating a systematic pulse-area error that arises from an imperfect rotating wave approximation for fast gates.
  Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed CMCCD achieves higher gate fidelity than conventional CCD schemes.
  We further implement and compare different CCD protocols using an electron spin-qubit in an isotopically purified $^{28}$Si-MOS quantum dot and evaluate its robustness by applying static detuning and Rabi frequency errors.
  The robustness is significantly improved compared to standard Rabi-drive, showing the effectiveness of this scheme for qubit arrays with variation in qubit frequency, coupling to Rabi drive, and low frequency noise.
  The proposed scheme can be applied to various physical systems, including trapped atoms, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and NV-centers.

Abstract: We analyze shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) and their completions for the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) with time-dependent frequency, as well as for quantum field theory (QFT) in non-stationary backgrounds. We exploit the analogy with one-dimensional quantum mechanics, and the well known correspondence between Bogoliubov coefficients in the QHO and transmission/reflection amplitudes in scattering theory. Within this framework, STA protocols for the QHO are equivalent to transmission resonances, while STA in QFT with homogeneous backgrounds correspond to reflectionless potentials. Moreover, using the connection between particle creation and squeezed states, we show how STA completions can be understood in terms of the anti-squeezing operator.

Abstract: Understanding error mechanisms in two-qubit gate operations is essential for building high-fidelity quantum processors. While prior studies predominantly treat dephasing noise as either Markovian or predominantly low-frequency, realistic qubit environments exhibit structured, frequency-dependent spectra. Here we demonstrate that noise at frequencies matching the dressed-state energy splitting--set by the inter-qubit coupling strength g--induces a distinct relaxation channel that degrades gate performance. Through combined theoretical analysis and experimental verification on superconducting qubits with engineered noise spectra, we show that two-qubit gate errors scale predictably with the noise power spectral density at frequency 2g, extending the concept of $T_{1ρ}$ relaxation to interacting systems. This frequency-selective relaxation mechanism, universal across platforms, enriches our understanding of decoherence pathways during gate operations. The same mechanism sets coherence limits for dual-rail or singlet-triplet encodings.

Abstract: We combine the study of resources in measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) with that of quantum solutions to linear constraint systems (LCS). Contextuality of the input state in MBQC has been identified as a key resource for quantum advantage, and in a stronger form, underlies algebraic relations between (measurement) operators which obey classically unsatisfiable (linear) constraints. Here, we compare these two perspectives on contextuality, and study to what extent they are related. More precisely, we associate a LCS to certain MBQC which exhibit strong forms of state-dependent contextuality, and ask if the measurement operators in such MBQC give rise to state-independent contextuality in the form of quantum solutions of its associated LCS. Our main result rules out such quantum solutions for a large class of MBQC. This both sharpens the distinction between state-dependent and state-independent forms of contextuality, and further generalises results on the non-existence of quantum solutions to LCS in finite odd (prime) dimension.

Abstract: We showcase the recently developed double transmon coupler (DTC) circuit as a compact, drop-in, tunable and transition-selective link between an otherwise coherent transmon and the continuum of modes in a waveguide. We use these transmon-DTC devices as transmon emitter/dectectors (TEDs) for microwave photons. We highlight the flexibility of these devices by sending photons from a source TED to a measurement TED using a meter of coaxial cable and a circulator, each TED with nominally identical circuit parameters. We detect $60\,\%$ of the photons using this setup where we infer that $95\,\%$ of the photons at the input of the measurement TED are detected. Reset and photon emission/detection each require about $2\,μ$s, for a minimum protocol duration of $4\,μ$s, for our choice of TED parameters. Transmon-waveguide links like the DTC serve an important role in quantum information processors: they provide a mechanism for unconditional fast reset, metrology, and as nascent quantum communication interfaces for quantum networking.

Abstract: Clinical trials are notorious for their high failure rates and steep costs, leading to wasted time and resources spend, prolonged development timelines, and delayed patient access to new therapies. A key contributor to these failures is biological uncertainty, which complicates trial design and weakens the ability to detect true treatment effects. In particular, inadequate patient stratification often results in covariate imbalances across treatment arms, masking treatment effects and reducing statistical power, even when therapies are effective for specific patient subpopulations. This work presents an optimization-based, quantum-enhanced approach to patient stratification that explicitly minimizes covariate imbalance across numerical and categorical variables, without altering protocol design or trial endpoints. Using real clinical trial data, we demonstrate that hybrid quantum-classical optimization methods achieve high-quality stratification while scaling efficiently to larger cohorts. In our benchmark study, the quantum-enhanced pipeline delivered over a 100x improvement in computational efficiency compared to classical approaches, enabling faster iteration and practical deployment at scale. This report shows how improved stratification can lead to decision-relevant gains, including up to a fivefold increase in statistical significance in treatment effect estimation, reducing treatment-effect dilution and increasing trial sensitivity. Together, these results show that optimization-driven stratification can strengthen clinical trial design, improve confidence in downstream decisions, and reduce the risk of costly late-stage failure.

Abstract: In this work, we present a new algorithm for generating quantum circuits that efficiently implement continuous time quantum walks on arbitrary simple sparse graphs. The algorithm, called matching decomposition, works by decomposing a continuous-time quantum walk Hamiltonian into a collection of exactly implementable Hamiltonians corresponding to matchings in the underlying graph followed by a novel graph compression algorithm that merges edges in the graph. Lastly, we convert the walks to a circuit and Trotterize over these components. The dynamics of the walker on each edge in the matching can be implemented in the circuit model as sequences of CX and CRx gates. We do not use Pauli decomposition when implementing walks along each matching. Furthermore, we compare matching decomposition to a standard Pauli-based simulation pipeline and find that matching decomposition consistently yields substantial resource reductions, requiring up to 43% fewer controlled gates and up to 54% shallower circuits than Pauli decomposition across multiple graph families. Finally, we also present examples and theoretical results for when matching decomposition can exactly simulate a continuous-time quantum walk on a graph.

Abstract: Freely propagating electrons may serve as quantum probes that can become coherently correlated with other quantum systems, offering access to advanced metrological resources. We propose a setup that coherently couples free electrons in an electron microscope to a trapped-ion quantum processor, enabling non-destructive, quantum-coherent detection and the accumulation of information across multiple electrons. Our analysis shows that single electrons can induce resolvable qubit excitations, establishing a platform for practical applications such as quantum-enhanced, dose-efficient electron microscopy.

Abstract: A central building block of a heat engine is the working fluid, which mediates the conversion of heat into work. In nanoscale heat engines, the working fluid can be a quantum system whose behavior and dynamics are non-classical. A particularly versatile realization is a quantum resonator, which allows for precise control and coupling to thermal reservoirs, making it an ideal platform for exploring quantum thermodynamic processes. Here, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of a driven quantum resonator whose temperature is controlled by modulating its natural frequency. We evaluate the work performed by the external drive and the resulting heat flow between the resonator and its environment, both within linear response and beyond. To further elucidate these processes, we determine the full distribution of photon exchanges between the resonator and its environment, characterized by its first few cumulants. Our results provide quantitative insights into the interplay between heat, work, and fluctuations, and may help in designing future heat engines.

Abstract: The Lévy flight foraging hypothesis states that organisms must have evolved adaptations to exploit Lévy walk search strategies. Indeed, it is widely accepted that inverse square Lévy walks optimize the search efficiency in foraging with unrestricted revisits (also known as non-destructive foraging). However, a mathematically rigorous demonstration of this for dimensions $D \geq 2$ is still lacking. Here we study the very closely related problem of a Lévy walker inside annuli or spherical shells with absorbing boundaries. In the limit that corresponds to the foraging with unrestricted revisits, we show that inverse square Lévy walks optimize the search. This constitutes the strongest formal result to date supporting the optimality of inverse square Lévy walks search strategies.

Abstract: Despite extensive study of the liquid-gas phase transition, accurately determining the critical point and the critical exponents in fluid systems through direct simulation remains a challenge. We employ the eigen microstate theory (EMT) to investigate the liquid-gas continuous phase transition in the Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid within the canonical ensemble. In EMT, the probability amplitudes of eigen microstates serve as the order parameter. Using finite-size scaling of probability amplitudes, we simultaneously determine the critical temperature, $T_c = 1.188(2)$, and critical density, $ρ_c = 0.320(4)$. Furturemore, we obtain critical exponents of the LJ fluid, $β= 0.32(2)$ and $ν= 0.64(3)$, which demonstrate a great agreement with the Ising universality class. This method also reveals the mesoscopic structure of the emergent phase, characterizing the three-dimensional (3D) spatial configuration of the fluid in the critical region. This work also confirms the finite-size scaling behavior of the probability amplitudes of the eigen microstates in the critical region. The EMT provides a powerful tool for studying the critical phenomena of complex fluid system.

Abstract: The exact solution of a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with the next nearest interactions at zero magnetic field is derived. At first, the transfer matrices are analyzed in three representations, i.e., Clifford algebraic representation, transfer tensor representation and schematic representation, to inspect nontrivial topological structures in this system. The system is equivalent to a triangular Ising model plus an interaction along the z axis, so that the approaches developed for the 3D Ising model are modified to be appropriable for solving the exact solution of the 2D Ising model with the next nearest interactions. The partition function and the spontaneous magnetization are obtained. The comparison with the exact solutions of other Ising lattices reveals that either the increase of the number of interactions in a unit cell or the presence/increase of topological contributions enhances the critical point of the Ising lattices. The results obtained in this work are helpful for understanding the physical properties of the 2D magnetic materials.

Abstract: A probabilistic formulation of irreversible kinetics is introduced in which incrementally admissible histories are weighted by a Gibbs-type measure built from an energy-dissipation action and observation constraints, with Theta controlling epistemic uncertainty. This measure can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior over histories. In the zero-uncertainty limit, it concentrates on maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) histories, recovering classical deterministic evolution by incremental minimization in the convex generalized-standard-material setting, while allowing multiple competing MAP histories for non-convex energies or temporally coupled constraints. This emergence is demonstrated across seven distinct forward-in-time examples and an inverse inference problem of unknown histories from sparse observations via a global constrained minimum-action principle.

Abstract: We study a variety of stochastic contact processes -- directly related to models of rumor and disease spreading -- from the viewpoint of their constants of motion, either exact or approximated. Much as in deterministic systems, constants of motion in stochastic dynamics make it possible to reduce the number of relevant variables, confining the set of accessible states, and thus facilitating their analytical treatment. For processes of rumor propagation based on the Maki-Thompson model, we show how to construct exact constants of motion as linear combinations of conserved quantities in each elementary contact event, and how they relate to the constants of motion of the corresponding mean-field equations, which are obtained as the continuous-time, large-size limit of the stochastic process. For SIR epidemic models, both in homogeneous systems and on heterogeneous networks, we find that a similar procedure produces approximate constants of motion, whose average value is preserved along the evolution. We also give examples of exact and approximate constants of motion built as nonlinear combinations of the relevant variables, whose expressions are suggested by their mean-field counterparts.

Abstract: The spatial distribution of a magnetic field can be determined with micrometer resolution using widefield nitrogen vacancy (NV) center magnetic imaging. Nevertheless, reconstructing the magnetic field from the raw data can be challenging due to the degeneracy of the four possible NV axes and the tremendous amount of data. While a qualitative approach is sufficient for most analyses, a quantitative analysis offers deeper insight into the physical system. Here, we apply NV widefield magnetic imaging to a HgBa$_{2}$Ca$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{8+δ}$ (Hg-1223) superconducting microcrystal at a pressure of 4 GPa. We fit the results with solutions from the Hamiltonian describing the NV center ground state and take into account the relative intensities of the resonances to determine the local magnetic field magnitude and angle. Thus, we reconstruct the temperature-dependent expulsion of the magnetic field due to the Meissner effect around the superconductor. By comparing the resulting parameters to Brandt's model, which describes the magnetic behavior of a type-II superconductor, we extract the critical current density $j_c$. Overall, this work showcases the first widefield quantitative reconstruction of the Meissner effect under pressure and an optical method to study critical current density. Thus, it provides new insights into the application of NV magnetometry to superconductivity research at high pressures.

Abstract: Superconductivity has been observed for the 2D electron gas (2DEG) at the interface of KTaO3 with other oxides, with a transition temperature about an order of magnitude higher than its 3d cousin SrTiO3. The superconducting transition temperature is strongly dependent on the orientation of the interface. Motivated by this observation, we study pairing due to exchange of the soft transverse optic phonon mode characteristic of quantum paraelectrics and use the resulting theory to comment on the nature of superconductivity of this 2DEG. We find (1) an orientation dependence consistent with experiment along with an anisotropic gap function, but (2) a BCS coupling constant that is smaller than needed and so must be augmented by contributions from other phonons to be consistent with the observed values of Tc.

Abstract: Electronic nematic and smectic liquid crystals are spontaneous symmetry-breaking phases that are seen to precede or coexist with enigmatic unconventional superconducting states in multiple classes of materials. In this Letter we describe scanning tunneling microscopy observations of a short ranged charge stripe (smectic) order in NaAlSi, whose superconductivity is speculated to have an unconventional origin. As well as this we resolve a clear spatial modulation of the superconducting gap amplitude, which arises due to the intertwined superconducting and smectic orders. Numerical calculations help to understand the possible driving mechanism as a suppression of kinetic energy on the Fermi surface formed in part by two large, flat-topped hole pockets of p-orbital character.

Abstract: In this work, we report that Bi2Ta3S6-family superconductors exhibit nontrivial band topology. They possess a natural quantum-well structure consisting of alternating stacks of TaS2 and honeycomb Bi layers, which contribute superconducting and topological properties, respectively. Symmetry-based indicators $(\mathbb{Z}_4;\mathbb{Z}_{2}\mathbb{Z}_{2}\mathbb{Z}_{2})=(2;000)$ reveal that the topological nature arises entirely from the Bi layers, which belong to a quantum spin Hall phase characterized by a $p_x-p_y$ model on a honeycomb lattice. The topological zigzag (ZZ) and armchair (AC) edge states are obtained. Using VASP2KP, the in-plane $g$ factors of these topological edge states are computed from the ab initio calculations: $g_{x/y}^{\mathrm{ZZ}}=2.07/1.60$ and $g_{x/y}^{\mathrm{AC}}=0.50/0.06$. The strong anisotropy of the edge-state $g$ factors allows us to explore Majorana zero modes in the Bi monolayer on a superconductor, which can be obtained by exfoliation or molecular beam epitaxy. The relaxed structures of the Bi2Ta3Se6, Bi2Nb3S6 and Bi2Nb3Se6 are obtained. Their superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ are estimated based on the electron-phonon coupling and the McMillan formula. Furthermore, using the experimental superconducting gap $Δ$ and the computed $g$ factors, we obtain the phase diagram, which shows that the in-plane field $B_y>2.62\mathrm{ T}$ can generate corner Majorana zero modes in the Bi monolayer of the superconductor Bi2Ta3S6. A similar paradigm also applies to the Bi2Ta3S6 bulk with the emergence of Majorana hinge states. These natural quantum-well superconductors therefore offer ideal platforms for exploring topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes.

Abstract: Using constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo, we map the ground-state phase diagram versus the nearest-neighbor (NN) attraction $V$ and spin-dependent hopping anisotropy $α$ for the two-dimensional attractive $t$--$U$--$V$ Hubbard model at filling $n\simeq0.85$. We identify an onsite $s$-wave superfluid, a Cooper pair Bose metal with an uncondensed Bose surface, and an oriented equal-spin triplet $p$-wave pairing phase. The NN attraction activates the odd-parity channel, while hopping anisotropy suppresses the competing $s$-wave coherence and selects a $p_x/p_y$ polar axis, and thus lowers the critical $|V_c|$ for the onset of triplet-dominant $p$-wave pairing. A channel-resolved Landau analysis provides a criterion for the Landau $p$-wave scale $V_c^{\mathrm L}(α)$, consistent with the observed anisotropy dependence of $|V_c|$. Our results establish how NN interaction and Fermi surface anisotropy cooperate to generate the oriented triplet $p$-wave pairing, and suggest that cold-atom and altermagnetic platforms could potentially realize this mechanism.

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the intrinsic timescale of a Josephson junction can be controlled through dynamical vacuum selection. By applying a Kapitza-like high-frequency drive to the system, the effective Josephson potential is reshaped, allowing for the stabilization of inphase or antiphase configuration. As a result, the Josephson plasma frequency, that is, the clock frequency of the junction, becomes a tunable property of the selected vacuum. Our findings establish a vacuum-controlled Josephson clock principle, in which the dynamical vacuum acts as an internal reference that fixes the operational timescale of Josephson oscillations, rather than this scale being imposed externally.

Abstract: A phase transition is an example of a ``topological defect'' in the space of parameters of a quantum or classical many-body systems. In this paper, we consider phase diagram topological defects of higher codimension. These have the property that equilibrium states undergo some kind of non-trivial winding as one moves around the defect. We show that such topological defects exist even in classical statistical mechanical systems, and describe their general structure in this context. We then introduce the term ``diabolical critical point'' (DCP), which is a higher-codimension analog of a continuous phase transition, with the proximate phases of matter replaced by the non-trivial winding of the proximate equilibrium states. We propose conditions under which a system can have a stable DCP. We also discuss some examples of stable DCPs in (1+1)-dimensional quantum systems.

Abstract: We present an extension to the two-dimensional functional renormalization group to efficiently treat interactions on the surface or at interfaces of three-dimensional systems. As an application, we consider a semi-infinite stack of two-dimensional square lattices, including a Hubbard interaction on the surface layer and an alternating interlayer coupling. We investigate how strongly correlated states of the decoupled two-dimensional Hubbard model on the surface evolve under inclusion of such an SSH-like interlayer coupling. For large parts of the phase diagram as a function of the interlayer hopping parameters, the physics of the two-dimensional system prevails, with antiferromagnetic, superconducting d-wave, and ferromagnetic correlations taking center stage. However, for intermediate interlayer couplings the superconducting state at intermediate interaction strengths separates into two regimes by a small region of incommensurate spin-density-wave and spin-bond order, enabling the potential realization of chiral spin-bond order.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that certain antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials with the same symmetry breaking as ferromagnets can generate sufficiently large ferromagnetic (FM) responses. Here, we report that the new AFM material NbMnAs exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) at zero field and at room temperature, despite having only a small net magnetization. A polycrystalline sample of NbMnAs, likely close to stoichiometric composition, exhibited an AFM state with a small spontaneous magnetization of approximately $6 \times 10^{-3} μ_{\rm B}$/Mn and the AHE below $T_{\rm N}=354\,{\rm K}$. In contrast, single crystals of NbMnAs obtained by a flux method exhibited a deficiency at the As site, {which resulted} in a decrease in $T_{\rm N}$ and an increase in spontaneous magnetization. Although improvement of the single-crystal growth is still required, our study reveals that NbMnAs is a novel material capable of exhibiting significant FM responses derived from antiferromagnetism at room temperature.

Abstract: The exploration of novel topological insulators (TIs) beyond binary chalcogenides has been accelerated in pursuit of exotic quantum states and device applications. Here, the layered ternary chalcogenide Ge2Bi2Te5 is identified as a three-dimensional TI. The bulk electronic structure of Ge2Bi2Te5 features a hole-type Fermi surface at Fermi level EF, which dominates the transport properties. Moreover, an unoccupied topological surface state with a Dirac point located at 290 meV above EF has been observed. Theoretical calculations confirm a bulk bandgap and a nontrivial Z2 topological invariant (000;1). The present study demonstrates that the material family of layered tetradymite-like ternary compounds is an important platform to explore exotic topological phenomena.

Abstract: Monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ has emerged as an attractive material platform to study intriguing phenomena related to topology and strong electron correlations. Recently, strong interactions have been demonstrated to induce strain and dielectric screening tunable topological phases such as quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), trivial insulator, higher-order topological insulator, and metallic phase, in the ground state of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$. Moreover, charge dosing has been demonstrated to convert the QSHI into a dual QSHI state. Although the band structure of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ is central to interpreting its topological phases in transport experiments, direct experimental access to its intrinsic electronic structure has so far remained elusive. Here we report direct measurements of the monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ band structure using spatially resolved micro-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) with micrometre-scale resolution. The observed dispersions show quantitative agreement with density functional theory calculations using the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional, establishing the insulating ground state and revealing no evidence for strong electronic correlations. We further uncover a pronounced electron-hole asymmetry in the doping response. Whereas hole doping is readily induced by electrostatic gating, attempts to introduce electrons via gating or alkali metal deposition do not yield a rigid upward shift of the Fermi level. Fractional charge calculations demonstrate that added electrons instead drive band renormalization and shrink the band gap. Taken together, our experimental and theoretical results identify the microscopic mechanism by which induced charges reshape the band topology of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$, showing that doping can fundamentally alter the electronic structure beyond the rigid band behaviour that is typically assumed.

Abstract: We establish a rigorous mathematical framework connecting graphene nanoribbon quantum sensing to the Lambert W function through the finite square well (FSW) analogy. The Lambert W function, defined as the inverse of $f(W) = We^W$, provides exact analytical solutions to transcendental equations governing quantum confinement. We demonstrate that operating near the branch point at $z = -1/e$ yields sensitivity enhancement factors scaling as $η_{\text{enh}} \propto (z - z_c)^{-1/2}$, achieving 35-fold enhancement at $δ= 0.001$. Comprehensive numerical verification confirms: (i) all seven bound states for strength parameter $R = 10$ satisfying the constraint $u^2 + v^2 = R^2$; (ii) exact agreement between theoretical band gap formula $E_g = 2π\hbar v_F/(3L)$ and empirical relation $E_g = 1.38/L$ eV$\cdot$nm; (iii) universal sensitivity scaling across biomedical (SARS-CoV-2, inflammatory markers, cancer biomarkers), environmental (CO$_2$, CH$_4$, NO$_2$, N$_2$O, H$_2$O), and physical (strain, magnetic field, temperature) sensing modalities. This unified framework provides design principles for next-generation graphene quantum sensors with analytically predictable performance.

Abstract: In this work we report a new and simple method that combines the pulsed laser ablation in liquids (PLAL) and the Sol-Gel techniques to obtain nanocomposite glasses and gelatins. Gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) are generated by PLAL using the corresponding target. The target is submerged in a transparent liquid solution made previously with tetraetylorthosilicate (TEOS) adding diluted hydrochloric acid as catalyzer. In the case of gelatins commercial gelatin and tap water are used. The laser source is a Nd:YAG laser emitting at 1064 nm, with an energy of 100 mJ and 8 ns pulse duration at 10 Hz repetition rate focused on the target in a 2 mm diameter laser spot. The ablation time is 10 min for the glasses and gelatins. The Au-NPs are uniformly dispersed in the solution. After the ablation process the gels are sealed and stored at room temperature for several days. The samples are characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, HRTEM, ellipsometry and AFM microscopy, these measurements reveal optical transparency and a refractive index near 1.45 for the pure glass, whereas a colorful aspect, a refractive index of 1.42, and a small surface roughness of 1.92 nm for the glass containing Au-NPs. In the case of gelatins self-sustained flexible films are obtained.

Abstract: Control of collective spin excitations by static or dynamic strain is an emerging phenomenon that requires in-depth understanding for design of future spin-wave-regulated devices. Here, we explore mutually interacting spin waves and acoustic wave modes in addition to few non-interactive modes through all optical excitation in ordered arrays of Ni80Fe20 nanomagnets. The acoustic wave originated from elastic deformation resonantly couple to the spin wave via magnetoelastic effect at their overlapping frequency. We demonstrate that the choice of the lattice type in which the magnetic nanodots are arranged is crucial for the observation of the magnetoelastic interaction. Therefore, the study shows that the simultaneous existence of elastic wave and spin wave offer ingeneously advantageous features to pave the way of energy-efficient magnetoacoustic devices.

Abstract: Compared to the study of graphene itself, the study of nano-structured graphene is rather limited because it is difficult to prepare atomically ordered edges. In this study, we have fabricated a periodically patterned mesh structure of graphene with atomically precise zigzag edges (zGNM: zigzag graphene nanomesh) and studied its thermal conductivity ($κ$) by opto-thermal Raman measurement. Unintuitively, it is found that the $κ$ of zGNM of 2,3 monolayers (MLs) thick is inversely proportional to the nanoribbon width ($W$), while that of zGNM of 5$\sim$10 MLs thick is independent of $W$ down to 30 nm. Since the $κ$ of suspended zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) is suppressed by decreasing $W$, this nonclassical behavior of zGNM is due to the mesh structure. In addition, zGNRs show a higher $κ$ than GNRs with atomically rough edges. This is probably due to the atomically ordered zigzag edges.

Abstract: We present the fabrication of nanoscale superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) at the apex of wireframe tips on self-aligned superconducting cantilever probes. The probes are made on silicon wafers using molding techniques in combination with corner lithography, which results in a nanowire frame tip with a tuneable apex structure. A shadow effect deposition using magnetron sputtering of Nb creates self-aligned superconducting wireframes on cantilevers with accompanying device circuitry. Superconducting weak links are realized at the apex of the wireframes with the use of focused ion beam nanopatterning. The realized SQUIDs have effective diameters ranging from several micrometers down to 100 nm and can be operated in magnetic fields up to 1 T. Furthermore, the nanowires in the wireframe can be used to flux modulate the SQUID locally. This fabrication process enables the production of wafer-scale templates for probes based on on-tip superconducting devices.

Abstract: We report on the observation on proximity-induced superconductivity in the topological insulator BiSbTeSe2 coupled to a disordered superconductor, amorphous indium oxide (a-InO). Resistance temperature measurements reveal superconducting signatures at low temperatures, even when InO is in an insulating state, indicating the persistence of superconducting correlations. Differential conductance spectra reveal nearly periodic oscillations at higher bias, together with a pronounced zero-bias conductance peak. Both effect disappears at high temperature, marking the critical temperature (T*) of the superconducting islands in InO. These results underscore the influence of topological surface states on proximity-induced superconductivity and highlight the role of superconducting fluctuations in disordered superconductor/topological-insulator hybrid interfaces.
