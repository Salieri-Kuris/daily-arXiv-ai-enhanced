Abstract: Entangling interactions between distant qubits can be mediated via an additional degree of freedom. In conventional trapped-ion schemes, realizing a well-defined, coherent gate typically requires spectrally addressing a specific bus mode. As the ion number increases, the coupling to each individual motional mode becomes weaker, so gates on large ion strings mediated by a single mode are necessarily slow. Moreover, addressing a large number of modes demands complex driving schemes, and the fundamentally perturbative character of these approaches imposes constraints on achievable gate speed and fidelity.
  Here, we introduce a scheme for entangling trapped-ion qubits using a time-dependent magnetic-field gradient, in which all axial motional modes participate in mediating the interaction and the gate construction is nonperturbative. The framework can be used to implement both multi-qubit gates and two-qubit gates between arbitrary pairs in a linear ion string. Through several explicit examples, we highlight the advantages over existing magnetic-gradient schemes and show how gates on multiple ion pairs can be carried out simultaneously.

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has been developed to target near term Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers as a method to find the eigenvalues of Hamiltonians. Unlike fully quantum algorithms such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), VQE based methods are hybrid algorithms that utilize both quantum and classical hardware to combat issues with the near term quantum hardware such as small numbers of available qubits and the decoherence of qubits. Different adaptations (flavors) of VQE have been implemented to combat these scalability issues on NISQ devices compared to standard VQE. These different flavors are modifications of the underlying VQE ansatz to reduce the computational workload on the quantum hardware. In this review we focus on 3 main areas related to VQE. The first focus is on flavors of VQE that fall under the categories of circuit complexity reduction, chemistry inspired ansatz, and extensions of VQE to excited states. The remaining portion of the review focuses on benchmarking the accuracy of VQE methods and an overview of the current state of quantum simulators.
