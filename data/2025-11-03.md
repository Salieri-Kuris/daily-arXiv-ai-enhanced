TL;DR: The paper demonstrates competitive quantum simulation of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model on Google's quantum processor, validating results against classical methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman was to simulate quantum many-body systems, which remains a promising application for understanding materials and molecules.

Method: The research implements simulations of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model on lattice sizes up to 6×6 using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, studying phenomena like magnetic polarons and thermalisation.

Result: The simulations achieved a scale beyond exact classical methods, studying various physical parameters and phenomena, with results validated against exact calculations and classical approximations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art quantum hardware, validating results against exact calculations and classical simulations.

Abstract: Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original
use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of
quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and
molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising
applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the
parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity
output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a
scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency
of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate
programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard
model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline
solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical simulation. We implement
simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to $6\times 6$ using 72 qubits on
Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters,
including on-site electron-electron interaction strength and magnetic flux, and
study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons, i.e. charge carriers
surrounded by local magnetic polarisation, dynamical symmetry breaking in
stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled state
known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through
thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter
regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical
simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods.
Our results demonstrate that programmable digital quantum simulation of
many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art
quantum hardware.

### [2] [The Particle in a Box in Koopman--von Neumann Mechanics: A Hilbert Space representation of Classical Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26856)
*Abhijit Sen,Lev Kaplan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文用KvN力学重新分析“盒子中的粒子”，发现能量可以连续分布，纠正了传统量子力学中的误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量子力学中“盒子中的粒子”问题通常导致能量量子化的结论，而KvN力学作为一种描述经典动力学的框架，可能提供不同的视角。本文旨在澄清这一差异并纠正常见的误解。

Method: 采用KvN力学的方法，通过正确的边界条件（描述弹性反射而非“在边界消失”）来研究粒子在盒子中的行为。

Result: 研究表明，在KvN力学中，粒子被限制在理想壁之间时，能量可以连续分布，而非量子化。同时，纠正了将KvN波函数仅视为位置概率振幅的错误边界条件。

Conclusion: 本文通过Koopman-von Neumann (KvN)力学重新审视了经典的“盒子中的粒子”问题，澄清了传统量子力学中能量量子化的误解，并展示了在KvN框架下，即使粒子被限制在理想壁之间，能量仍然可以连续分布。

Abstract: This paper revisits the textbook 'particle in a box', but from the point of
view of Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) mechanics. KvN mechanics is a way to describe
\emph{classical} dynamics in a Hilbert space. That simple fact changes the
usual expectation: hard walls do \emph{not} force energy quantization here. We
show, in a clear and physical way, why a KvN particle confined between two
ideal walls still has a continuous range of energies. With the correct wall
condition, one that captures ordinary elastic reflection rather than 'vanishing
at the boundary,' the KvN description naturally produces spatial confinement
without discrete energy levels. Beyond establishing this result, we also clean
up common misunderstandings: for example, treating the KvN wavefunction like a
quantum probability amplitude in position alone leads to the wrong boundary
picture and, with it, the wrong conclusion about quantization.

### [3] [Single-Photon-Level Atomic Frequency Comb Storage in Room Temperature Alkali Vapour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26870)
*Zakary Schofield,Vanderli Laurindo Jr,Ori Ezrah Mor,Patrick M. Ledingham*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Room-temperature rubidium vapor was used to store and retrieve single-photon-level light with the atomic frequency comb protocol, achieving notable efficiency and paving the way for qubit storage applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to advance quantum memory capabilities by exploring coherent light storage at room temperature, which is crucial for practical quantum communication and computing applications.

Method: Velocity-selective optical pumping was employed to prepare an atomic frequency comb within the rubidium vapor's hyperfine ground state. The comb's peak spacing matched half the hyperfine splitting of the excited state, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of weak coherent states.

Result: The protocol achieved storage efficiencies of 6.59% for single-photon-level light and 2.6% for two temporally distinct modes. The efficiency was polarization-independent, suggesting potential for polarization qubit storage.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrated coherent storage and retrieval of single-photon-level light in room-temperature rubidium vapor using the atomic frequency comb protocol. The method supports time-bin and potential polarization qubit storage, indicating versatility in quantum memory applications.

Abstract: We have demonstrated the coherent storage and retrieval of
single-photon-level light using the atomic frequency comb protocol in a room
temperature rubidium vapour. Velocity-selective optical pumping is used to
prepare the comb within the $F=2$ hyperfine ground state of rubidium, with the
spacing between peaks coinciding with half the $F = 2 - F =3$ hyperfine
splitting of the $5^2$P$_{3/2}$ excited state. Weak coherent states of average
photon number $\mu_\mathrm{in} = 0.083(5)$ are stored with pre-programmed
recall time of $7.5\,$ns with an efficiency of $\eta_{\textrm{AFC}} =
6.59(5)\,\%$, while two temporally distinct modes have been stored and recalled
with $\eta_{\textrm{AFC}} = 2.6(1)\,\%$, allowing for time-bin qubit storage.
Finally, the efficiency is observed to be independent of the input pulse
polarisation, paving the way for polarisation qubit storage.

### [4] [Exact and approximate conditions of tabletop reversibility: when is Petz recovery cost-free?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26895)
*Minjeong Song,Hyukjoon Kwon,Valerio Scarani*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores conditions for 'tabletop time-reversibility' (TTR) in quantum channels, showing exact TTR needs time-sensitive control, while approximate TTR does not, and derives Lindbladian TTR conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the conditions under which the Petz recovery map and the original quantum channel require similar or identical resources, focusing on the concept of 'tabletop time-reversibility' (TTR).

Method: The study employs systematic analysis of the Petz recovery map, examining exact and approximate TTR conditions, and derives Lindbladian TTR conditions under a random-time collision model.

Result: The results show that exact TTR necessitates time-sensitive control of an ancilla system, whereas approximate TTR relaxes this requirement. The Lindbladian TTR conditions further extend the understanding of resource requirements.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that exact tabletop reversibility (TTR) requires time-sensitive control of an ancilla system, while approximate TTR does not. Additionally, Lindbladian TTR conditions are derived under a random-time collision model, providing insights into the resources needed for quantum channel recovery.

Abstract: Channels $\mathcal{N}$ that describe open quantum dynamics are inherently
irreversible: it is impossible to undo their effect completely, but one can
study partial recovery of the information. The Petz recovery map
$\hat{\mathcal{N}}_{\gamma}^{(\texttt{P})}$ is a systematic construction that
depends only on $\mathcal{N}$ and on a reference state $\gamma$, which will be
recovered exactly. If the real input state was different from $\gamma$, the
recovery is partial, with a guarantee of near-optimality. Generically, an
implementation of the Petz recovery map would look very different from the
implementation of the channel. It is natural to study under which conditions
the two maps require similar or even identical resources. The noisy forward
channel $\mathcal{N}$ is called ``tabletop time-reversible'' for a given
$\gamma$ when the corresponding Petz recovery map is realizable in such a way.
First, we study the exact tabletop reversibility (TTR) conditions. We show in
particular that a time-sensitive control of an ancilla system is needed.
Second, we present the approximate TTR conditions, which do not require such a
time-sensitive control. Third, we derive Lindbladian TTR conditions under a
random-time collision model.

TL;DR: 周期性驱动的量子系统可作为高选择性参数滤波器，通过三量子比特系统中的周期倍增相实现磁场和耦合强度的不对称测量敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究周期性驱动量子系统在量子传感中的应用潜力，特别是通过周期倍增相实现参数选择性测量。

Method: 使用横向场Floquet Ising模型描述的三量子比特系统，分析周期倍增相的动力学特性及其对磁场和耦合强度的敏感性差异。

Result: 周期倍增相显著提高了Ising相互作用强度的测量精度，同时抑制了对横向磁场的敏感性；非周期倍增相则适用于横向磁场测量。

Conclusion: 有限尺寸Floquet系统的不同动力学机制可用于针对性量子传感，实验可观测量的经典Fisher信息可量化这一效应。

Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems can function as highly selective
parameter filters. We demonstrate this capability in a finite-size, three-qubit
system described by the transverse-field Floquet Ising model. In this system,
we identify a period-doubling (PD) dynamical phase that exhibits a stark
asymmetry in metrological sensitivity to the magnetic field applied on the
qubits and to the coupling strength between the qubits. The PD phase originates
from $\pi$-pairing, where the initial state exhibits strong overlap with
$\pi$-paired Floquet eigenstates, leading to robust period-doubled dynamics and
enhanced metrological sensitivity. The analysis of quantum Fisher information
reveals that the PD regime significantly enhances precision for estimating the
Ising interaction strength while simultaneously suppressing sensitivity to the
transverse magnetic field. Conversely, non-PD regimes are optimal for sensing
the transverse field. This filtering effect is robust for larger system sizes
and is quantifiable using experimentally accessible observables, such as
magnetization and two-qubit correlations, via the classical Fisher information.
Our work shows that distinct dynamical regimes in finite-size Floquet systems
can be harnessed for targeted quantum sensing.

*Emil Otis Rosanowski,Jurek Eisinger,Lena Funcke,Ulrich Poschinger,Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: SKQD方法通过混合量子-经典方法模拟Schwinger模型，准确捕捉相结构并减少有效希尔伯特空间，显示出在更大体积模拟中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SKQD方法在晶格规范理论中的应用，特别是Schwinger模型中的θ项对基态能量和粒子数的影响。

Method: 采用混合量子-经典方法：(i) 从时间演化的量子态中采样比特串构建克雷洛夫空间，(ii) 在该子空间中对哈密顿量进行经典对角化。

Result: SKQD准确捕捉了模型的相结构，并在不同量子处理器上表现一致，有效减少了希尔伯特空间的维度。

Conclusion: SKQD方法在模拟晶格规范理论中表现出色，尤其是在减少有效希尔伯特空间方面，尽管克雷洛夫空间维度仍呈指数增长，但其较慢的增长速度显示出在更大体积模拟中的潜力。

Abstract: We apply the recently proposed Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization
(SKQD) method to lattice gauge theories, using the Schwinger model with a
$\theta$-term as a benchmark. SKQD approximates the ground state of a
Hamiltonian, employing a hybrid quantum-classical approach: (i) constructing a
Krylov space from bitstrings sampled from time-evolved quantum states, and (ii)
classically diagonalizing the Hamiltonian within this subspace. We study the
dependence of the ground-state energy and particle number on the value of the
$\theta$-term, accurately capturing the model's phase structure. The algorithm
is implemented on trapped-ion and superconducting quantum processors,
demonstrating consistent performance across platforms. We show that SKQD
substantially reduces the effective Hilbert space, and although the Krylov
space dimension still scales exponentially, the slower growth underscores its
promise for simulating lattice gauge theories in larger volumes.

Motivation: 光互连是扩展原子量子计算机的关键技术，但现有方法中状态准备步骤耗时过长，限制了性能。

Conclusion: 通过电子杂耍技术，光互连的远程纠缠生成速率显著提高，有望实现每秒超过1,000个贝尔对的生成速率。

Abstract: Photonic interconnects are a key technology for scaling up atomic based
quantum computers. By facilitating the connection of multiple systems,
high-performance modular quantum processing units may be constructed to perform
deeper and more useful algorithms. Most previous implementations of photonic
interconnects in trapped ions utilize the scheme of preparing a state, exciting
it, and collecting single photons from decays of the excited state. State
preparation is responsible for the vast majority of the total attempt time,
often taking hundreds of nanoseconds to several microseconds. Here, we describe
and analyze a novel technique called ``electron juggling" to speed up photonic
interconnects by reducing the state preparation step substantially. Using a
theoretical framework, we illustrate how this scheme can significantly increase
remote entanglement generation rates, approaching the atomic physics limit of
the attempt rate in trapped-ion photonic interconnects. Our results indicate
that this scheme holds the possibility of achieving remote entanglement
generation rates of over 1,000 Bell pairs per second.

*Noah Gorgichuk,Mohammad Ayyash,Matteo Mariantoni,Sahel Ashhab*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A protocol using multiphoton interactions for preparing symmetric oscillator states improves bosonic codes, validated by simulations with realistic hardware parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency and robustness of bosonic quantum error correction codes by reducing state preparation time and improving control over oscillator states.

Method: The protocol utilizes multiphoton interactions between an oscillator and an auxiliary qubit, combined with different interaction orders for arbitrary control over the oscillator's Hilbert space.

Result: Numerical simulations with realistic parameters confirm the protocol's robustness, showing substantial time reduction compared to linear interactions.

Conclusion: The protocol for preparing oscillator states with $n$-fold rotational symmetry significantly improves the performance of bosonic codes on planar superconducting hardware, advancing scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: We present a protocol for preparing oscillator states with $n$-fold
rotational symmetry, which include many logical codewords for bosonic quantum
error correction codes. The protocol relies on a multiphoton interaction
between the oscillator and an auxiliary qubit. Further, we achieve arbitrary
control over the oscillator's Hilbert space by using a combination of different
multiphoton interaction orders. We also discuss the preparation of
rotationally-symmetric multi-oscillator states using a generalized variant of
the protocol. We show that the use of multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions
can substantially reduce the state preparation time, in comparison to the
linear qubit-oscillator interactions that are usually employed. Furthermore, we
perform numerical simulations that take into account qubit and oscillator
relaxation and dephasing using realistic planar superconducting circuit
parameters that validate the robustness of our protocol. Our findings can
significantly improve the performance of bosonic codes on planar
superconducting hardware, which are an almost inevitable necessity for scalable
bosonic fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers.

*Abhishek Muhuri,Tanoy Kanti Konar,Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju,Aditi Sen De*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The Bell operator effectively detects dynamical quantum phase transitions in a long-range XY spin chain, outperforming traditional correlators in identifying critical boundaries after sudden quenches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of identifying equilibrium criticalities and phases from system dynamics, especially when relying solely on local observables, by leveraging the Bell operator's ability to detect nonlocal correlations.

Method: The research employs sudden quench protocols of the magnetic field strength and interaction fall-off rate in a long-range XY spin chain, analyzing the behavior of the Bell operator and comparing it with classical and quantum correlators.

Result: The Bell operator exhibits a distinct drop at critical boundaries following sudden quenches, defining a threshold between intra-phase and inter-phase quenches, robust against variations in interaction strength, anisotropy, and system size.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the two-body Bell operator is an effective witness for dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in a long-range XY spin chain, outperforming conventional correlators like entanglement in detecting critical boundaries.

Abstract: Identifying equilibrium criticalities and phases from the dynamics of a
system, known as a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), is a challenging
task when relying solely on local observables. We exhibit that the
experimentally accessible two-body Bell operator, originally designed to detect
nonlocal correlations in quantum states, serves as an effective witness of
DQPTs in a long-range (LR) XY spin chain subjected to a magnetic field, where
the interaction strength decays as a power law. Following a sudden quench of
the system parameters, the Bell operator between nearest-neighbor spins
exhibits a distinct drop at the critical boundaries. In this study, we consider
two quenching protocols, namely sudden quenches of the magnetic field strength
and the interaction fall-off rate. This pronounced behavior defines a
threshold, distinguishing intra-phase from inter-phase quenches, remaining
valid regardless of the strength of long-range interactions, anisotropy, and
system sizes. Comparative analyses further demonstrate that conventional
classical and quantum correlators, including entanglement, fail to capture this
transition during dynamics.

Motivation: 研究多光子Kerr参量振荡器中能级间跃迁的干涉效应及其对光谱的影响，填补了先前理论中忽略的密度矩阵非对角元作用的空白。

Method: 扩展了先前的反射测量理论，引入了能级间跃迁与密度矩阵非对角元之间的相互作用，并推广到透射测量。

Result: 发现能级间跃迁的干涉效应显著改变了光谱，并确定了干涉条件及密度矩阵非对角元影响光谱的条件。

Conclusion: 该研究通过理论分析，揭示了多光子Kerr参量振荡器中能级间跃迁的干涉效应对反射和透射光谱的显著影响，并提出了适用于更广泛系统的理论框架。

Abstract: We theoretically investigate reflection and transmission measurements of
two-photon and four-photon Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), introducing
interference effects between inter-level transitions. Due to the level
degeneracy of a KPO, a probe field can be resonant with multiple inter-level
transitions. We extend the previous theory of reflection measurements by
incorporating the interaction between inter-level transitions and off-diagonal
elements of the density matrix which had previously been neglected. We
demonstrate that interference among these transitions substantially modifies
the spectrum. We identify the conditions for the interference, as well as those
under which the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix affect the
spectrum. The theory is also generalized to transmission measurements, and is
applicable to a broad class of systems beyond KPOs.

*Partha Ghose*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper shows how the KvN classical mechanics formulation arises from the $\lambda \to 1$ limit of a stochastic framework, unifying quantum, stochastic, and classical dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics by exploring the $\lambda \to 1$ limit of a stochastic framework.

Method: The study uses the $\lambda$ parameter in Ghose's interpolating equation to transition between quantum and classical regimes, showing how the KvN formulation emerges naturally.

Result: The KvN Hilbert-space formulation of classical mechanics emerges as the $\lambda \to 1$ limit, providing a continuous transition between quantum and classical dynamics.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a unified framework linking quantum, stochastic, and classical dynamics through the $\lambda \to 1$ limit of the stochastic $\sigma$--$\lambda$ hierarchy, with the KvN phase-space amplitude representing the classical Liouville equation.

Abstract: Nelson's stochastic mechanics links quantum mechanics to an underlying
Brownian motion with the identification $\hbar = m\sigma$. Ghose's
interpolating equation introduces a continuous parameter $\lambda$ that
suppresses the quantum potential $Q[\psi]$ and yields a smooth transition
between quantum ($\lambda=0$) and classical ($\lambda=1$) regimes. In this
short note, we show that the Koopman--von Neumann (KvN) Hilbert-space
formulation of classical mechanics emerges naturally as the $\lambda \to 1$
limit of this stochastic $\sigma$--$\lambda$ hierarchy. The KvN phase-space
amplitude provides an operator representation of the classical Liouville
equation, while the $\lambda$ parameter acts as a projection flow from the
complex projective Hilbert manifold $\mathbb{C}P^n$ to its classical quotient
$\mathbb{C}P^*/U(1)$, implementing phase superselection. This unified picture
links quantum, stochastic, and classical dynamics within a single continuous
framework.

TL;DR: Analytical derivation of zitterbewegung effects in non-Hermitian systems, showing novel corrections to group velocity and spin dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the qualitatively different spin dynamics in non-Hermitian systems compared to Hermitian ones, particularly the zitterbewegung effects arising from non-Hermitian spin dynamics.

Method: The work generalizes the description of zitterbewegung effects to non-Hermitian systems, focusing on spin dynamics and the induced nonlinear terms from the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

Result: The study reveals novel non-Hermitian corrections to the group velocity and demonstrates the impact of non-Hermitian spin dynamics on zitterbewegung effects.

Conclusion: The study analytically derives a semi-classical equation of motion for zitterbewegung effects in non-Hermitian systems, highlighting novel non-Hermitian corrections to group velocity and the role of the non-Hermitian quantum metric tensor.

Abstract: In this work, we analytically derive a semi-classical equation of motion
describing the zitterbewegung effects arising in the dynamics of wavepackets in
non-Hermitian systems. In Hermitian non-relativistic quantum systems, the
zitterbewegung effects can arise due to the spin precession and spin-orbit
coupling. Interestingly, the spin dynamics in non-Hermitian systems are
qualitatively different because of the effective nonlinear terms induced by the
non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show the effects from
the non-Hermitian spin dynamics by generalising the description of
zitterbewegung effects to non-Hermitian systems. We also uncover novel
non-Hermitian correction to the group velocity, which can be expressed in terms
of the non-Hermitian quantum metric tensor in the absence of out-of-plane
effective field.

Motivation: 研究纠缠的单配性（monogamy of entanglement）及其逆命题（CMoE）在多体量子系统中的表现，以深化对量子纠缠共享特性的理解。

Method: 通过分析多体纯态中的纠缠层次，并利用可分离性标准和可蒸馏性条件，扩展了CMoE的概念。

Conclusion: 本文通过扩展Hayashi和Chen以及Singh和Datta的工作，证明了在更广泛条件下CMoE的存在性，并表明这些扩展在考虑的层次上是最大的。

Abstract: Unlike classical correlations, entanglement cannot be freely shared among
multiple parties. This unique feature of quantum systems is known as the
monogamy of entanglement. While it holds for all multipartite pure states, its
converse -- weak entanglement between two parties enforces strong entanglement
with a third party -- occurs only under specific conditions. In particular,
Hayashi and Chen [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{84}, 012325 (2011)] demonstrated a
qualitative version of the converse monogamy of entanglement (CMoE) for
tripartite pure states by employing a hierarchy of bipartite entanglement
defined through the relations among various separability criteria, and Singh
and Datta [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory \textbf{69}, 6564 (2023)] later extended
this notion of the CMoE from the viewpoint of distillability under one-way or
two-way classical communication. In this work, we extend their results to the
CMoE with broader conditions, and furthermore show that our extensions are
maximal with respect to the hierarchies they considered.

Conclusion: ID-MAC 是一种可扩展且高效的 MAC 解决方案，适用于未来的多芯片量子架构，显著提升了系统性能和一致性。

Abstract: Scalable quantum computing requires modular multi-chip architectures
integrating multiple quantum cores interconnected through quantum-coherent and
classical links. The classical communication subsystem is critical for
coordinating distributed control operations and supporting quantum protocols
such as teleportation. In this work, we consider a realization based on a
wireless network-on-chip for implementing classical communication within
cryogenic environments. Traditional token-based medium access control (MAC)
protocols, however, incur latency penalties due to inefficient token
circulation among inactive nodes. We propose the instruction-directed token MAC
(ID-MAC), a protocol that leverages the deterministic nature of quantum circuit
execution to predefine transmission schedules at compile time. By embedding
instruction-level information into the MAC layer, ID-MAC restricts token
circulation to active transmitters, thereby improving channel utilization and
reducing communication latency. Simulations show that ID-MAC reduces classical
communication time by up to 70% and total execution time by up to 30-70%, while
also extending effective system coherence. These results highlight ID-MAC as a
scalable and efficient MAC solution for future multi-chip quantum
architectures.

*I Gusti Ngurah Yudi Handayana,Ya-Tang Yu,Wei-Hsuan Chung,H. H. Jen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) framework to control excitation transport via engineered emitter coupling directionality, revealing four distinct dynamical behaviors and robust transport characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore and control collective light-matter interactions in low-dimensional photonic environments by moving beyond conventional wQED systems that rely on uniform chirality or reciprocal emitter-waveguide coupling.

Method: The authors propose a structured wQED framework where the coupling directionality of each emitter is engineered locally. They analyze four representative configurations with distinct dynamical behaviors and use spectral analysis of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to understand the dynamics. Variance analysis is employed to quantify excitation spreading.

Result: The results show that the proposed structured wQED framework exhibits four distinct dynamical behaviors (centering, wave-like, leap-frog, and dispersion excitations) due to interferences among subradiant eigenmodes. The transport characteristics remain robust for realistic coupling efficiencies (beta >= 0.99), even with nonguided losses.

Conclusion: The study establishes structured waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) as a practical method for manipulating excitation localization, coherence, and transport through programmable directionality patterns. This paves the way for controllable subradiant transport and chiral quantum information routing.

Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) has become a central platform for
studying collective light-matter interactions in low-dimensional photonic
environments. While conventional wQED systems rely on uniform chirality or
reciprocal emitter-waveguide coupling, we propose a structured wQED framework,
where the coupling directionality of each emitter can be engineered locally to
control excitation transport in an atom-nanophotonic interface. For different
combinations of patterned coupling directionalities of the emitters, we
identify four representative configurations that exhibit distinct dynamical
behaviors: centering, wave-like, leap-frog, and dispersion excitations.
Spectral analysis of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian reveals that these
dynamics originate from interferences among subradiant eigenmodes. Variance
analysis further quantifies the spreading of excitation as functions of
interatomic spacing and global chirality, showing tunable
localization-delocalization transitions. Including nonguided losses, we find
that the transport characteristics remain robust for realistic coupling
efficiencies (beta >= 0.99). These results establish structured wQED as a
practical route to manipulate excitation localization, coherence, and transport
through programmable directionality patterns, paving the way for controllable
subradiant transport and chiral quantum information routing.

Abstract: Quantum simulation aims to recreate complex many-body phenomena in controlled

typically requiring ultra-pure vacuum or low temperatures. Here, we realize a
room-temperature quantum simulator using a thin ${}^{13}\text{C}$ nuclear spin

and, combined with radio-frequency fields, coherent control of the nuclear
spins. We demonstrate strong, tunable interactions among the nuclear spins and
use the system to investigate discrete time-crystalline order. By combining
ease of use with operation at ambient temperatures, our work opens new
opportunities for investigating strongly correlated many-body effects.

*Jan Wójcik*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum and classical walks show identical MHT in symmetric conditions, but stochastic resetting reveals a quantum advantage in MHT reduction, useful for noisy quantum devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to address the limitations of using MSD as the sole metric for comparing quantum and classical random walks, as it may not fully capture non-Gaussian features of quantum walks. The study explores MHT as a complementary metric with operational significance for search algorithms.

Method: Analytical calculations were used to compare quantum and classical walks, focusing on MHT and MSD metrics. The impact of stochastic resetting and noise was also analyzed.

Result: Quantum and classical walks yield identical MHT for symmetric initial conditions with two detectors, indicating context-dependent quantum advantages. Stochastic resetting reveals a quantum advantage in MHT reduction due to quasi-momentum redistribution, which degrades with noise.

Conclusion: The study highlights that different metrics, such as mean hitting time (MHT) and mean squared displacement (MSD), can reveal distinct aspects of quantum-classical comparisons in walk-based algorithms. MHT reduction under stochastic resetting serves as a signature of quantum behavior, useful for characterizing noisy quantum devices.

Abstract: The mean squared displacement has been widely used as the primary metric for
comparing quantum and classical random walks, with quantum walks showing
quadratic scaling versus linear scaling for classical walks. However, this
comparison may not capture the full picture: while the mean squared
displacement is well-suited for Gaussian distributions, quantum walk
distributions exhibit distinctly non-Gaussian features. We propose that the
mean hitting time offers a complementary perspective with clear operational
meaning for search algorithms. Through analytical calculations, we show that
quantum and classical walks yield identical MHT for symmetric initial
conditions with two detectors, suggesting that the apparent quantum advantage
seen in MSD comparisons may be context-dependent. Interestingly, introducing
stochastic resetting reveals new dynamics. We demonstrate analytically that
quantum walks can achieve reduced MHT under stochastic reset through
quasi-momentum redistribution, while classical walks see no benefit. This
quantum advantage naturally degrades with noise, the quantum walk converges to
classical behavior. We suggest that MHT reduction under stochastic reset can
serve as an additional signature of quantum behavior, particularly useful for
characterizing quantum walk implementations on noisy quantum devices. Our
results indicate that different metrics can reveal different aspects of
quantum-classical comparisons in walk-based algorithms.

Abstract: The precise measurement of spatial attitude parameters is critical for
applications in inertial navigation, industrial monitoring, instrument
calibration, quantum metrology, etc. In this work, we theoretically investigate
and experimentally realize the simultaneous measurement of the yaw and pitch
angles using a Hermite-Gaussian-postselected double weak value system
integrated with two sets of high-order-mode balanced homodyne detections,
thereby achieving a complete characterization of the beam deflection. Signals
of the yaw and pitch angles that are involved in TEM$_{10}$ and TEM$_{01}$
modes output from two dark ports of the system can be measured independently.
As a result, the obtained minimum measurable yaw and pitch angles of beam
deflection are 83 prad and 89 prad, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding
displacements are 0.79 pm and 0.85 pm, respectively. This work expands the beam
deflection measurement to two dimensions, which provides a new insight for
future high-precision multi-parameter spatial precise detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of prior work, which failed to yield classical perfect secret sharing schemes with optimal information rates for hypercyclic access structures with three hyperedges, and to extend the efficiency concept from quantum key distribution to QSS.

Method: The method combines Simmons' geometric method with Shamir's threshold scheme to construct classical perfect secret sharing schemes with optimal information rates, followed by building perfect QSS schemes using single photons in d-dimensional quantum systems.

Result: The results include the classification of hypercycles into 12 non-isomorphic types, the construction of efficient classical and quantum secret sharing schemes, and the establishment of a relationship between efficiency and idealized information rate.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the constructed quantum secret sharing (QSS) schemes for hypercyclic access structures with three hyperedges achieve the highest efficiency among existing solutions, with a clear relationship established between the efficiency of minimally authorized subsets and the idealized information rate.

Abstract: This paper investigates the construction of efficient quantum secret sharing
schemes for quantum access structures based on hypergraphs with three
hyperedges. We prove that hypercycles with three hyperedges are quantum access
structures if and only if they can be classified into 12 non-isomorphic types
under hypergraph isomorphism, and these hypercyclic quantum access structures
encompass all four hyperstars with three hyperedges.In prior work, efficient
and perfect quantum secret sharing schemes were constructed for hyperstar
access structures with three hyperedges using single photons in d -dimensional
quantum systems. These schemes correspond to classical perfect secret sharing
schemes with optimal information rates. However, for hypercyclic access
structures with three hyperedges, the method described above fails to yield
classical perfect secret sharing schemes with optimal information rates. In
this work, we explicitly construct classical perfect secret sharing schemes
with optimal information rates for these access structures by combining
Simmons' geometric method with Shamir's threshold scheme. Subsequently, we
employ single photons in d-dimensional quantum systems to build perfect QSS
schemes upon these classical constructions.We introduce the concept of
idealized information rate for minimal access structures in perfect QSS
schemes. By extending the notion of efficiency proposed by Cabello [Phys. Rev.
Lett., vol. 85, no. 26, p. 5635, 2000] for quantum key distribution protocols
to QSS, we define the efficiency of minimally authorized subsets. Furthermore,
we establish the relationship between the efficiency of minimally authorized
subsets and the idealized information rate of minimal access structures.
Finally, we rigorously prove that the QSS schemes constructed in this work
achieve the highest efficiency among existing solutions.

Motivation: The study aims to extend classical synchronization to the quantum domain, exploring fundamental physics and potential quantum technology applications.

Method: The research employs an effective spin-1 model realized by coupling three quantum states to auxiliary excited states. The model is benchmarked using master equation calculations for the full Hilbert space and analytical perturbation theory.

Result: Key findings include the controllability of phase synchronization via coupling phases, the critical role of dissipative decay out of the limit cycle state, and a parameter regime where synchronization is governed entirely by effective dissipators.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that phase synchronization in an effective spin-1 system can be controlled by adjusting coupling phases and is governed by a competition between dissipative decay into and out of the limit cycle state. The findings are validated through comparisons with master equation calculations and analytical perturbation theory, with potential applications in quantum technology.

Abstract: Extending classical synchronization to the quantum domain is of great
interest both from the fundamental physics point of view and with a view toward
quantum technology applications. This work characterizes phase synchronization
of an effective spin-1 system, which is realized by coupling three quantum
states with infinite lifetime to auxiliary excited states that have a finite
lifetime. Integrating out the excited states, the effective spin-1 model
features coherent and incoherent effective couplings. Our key findings are: (i)
Phase synchronization can be controlled by adjusting the phases of the
couplings to the excited states. (ii) Unlike in the paradigmatic spin-1 system
studied in the literature, where the dissipative couplings describe decay into
the limit cycle state, the effective spin-1 model investigated in this work is
governed by a competition between dissipative decay into and out of the limit
cycle state, with the dissipative decay out of the limit cycle state playing a
critical role. (iii) We identify a parameter regime where phase synchronization
of the effective spin-1 system is -- in the absence of coherent effective
couplings -- governed entirely by the effective dissipators. The effective
spin-1 model is benchmarked through comparisons with master equation
calculations for the full Hilbert space. Physical insights are gained through
analytical perturbation theory calculations. Our findings, which are expected
to hold for a broad class of energy level and coupling schemes, are
demonstrated using hyperfine states of $^{87}$Rb.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores entanglement's role in energy-constrained communication, showing it may not help classical tasks but can benefit quantum tasks via non-unitary encoding. Higher-dimensional entanglement boosts advantages, and quantum random number generation stays secure in low-energy settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand how shared entanglement functions in energy-constrained communication scenarios, particularly in classical and quantum contexts. It also seeks to evaluate the security implications for quantum random number generation in low-energy regimes.

Method: The paper investigates the role of shared entanglement in prepare-and-measure experiments with energy constraints. It derives a general correlation criterion for nonlocal resources in classical communication and examines non-unitary encoding schemes for quantum communication. Higher-dimensional entanglement is also explored. The study includes attacks on quantum random number generation protocols to assess security.

Result: For classical communication, entanglement can fail to be a resource in standard tasks. For quantum communication, non-unitary encoding schemes unlock entanglement's advantages, which are further enhanced by higher-dimensional entanglement. Quantum random number generation remains largely secure in low-energy regimes.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that entanglement's role in energy-constrained communication varies with the context. For classical communication, entanglement may not always be beneficial, while for quantum communication, non-unitary encoding schemes can unlock its advantages. Higher-dimensional entanglement further enhances these benefits. The findings also suggest that quantum random number generation remains secure in low-energy regimes, offering potential for improved security without complex setups.

Abstract: A promising platform for semi-device-independent quantum information is
prepare-and-measure experiments restricted only by a bound on the energy of the
communication. Here, we investigate the role of shared entanglement in such
scenarios. For classical communication, we derive a general correlation
criterion for nonlocal resources and use it to show that entanglement can fail
to be a resource in standard tasks. For quantum communication, we consider the
basic primitive for energy-constrained communication, namely the probabilistic
transmission of a bit, and show that the advantages of entanglement only can be
unlocked by non-unitary encoding schemes that purposefully decohere the
entangled state. We also find that these advantages can be increased by using
entanglement of higher dimension than qubit. We leverage these insights to
investigate the impact of entanglement for quantum random number generation,
which is a standard application of these systems but whose security so far only
has been established against classical side information. In the low-energy
regime, our attacks on the protocol indicate that the security remains largely
intact, thereby paving the way for strengthened security without more complex
setups and with negligible performance reductions.

Conclusion: 纠缠熵虽然是量子混沌的重要指标，但在某些特定约束条件下（如Rydberg-like blockade），即使系统表现出完全的混沌行为，纠缠熵仍可能严格遵循面积律。这表明纠缠熵不能单独作为多体量子混沌的诊断工具，希尔伯特空间的几何结构对量子动力学和热化有深远影响。

Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental diagnostic for quantum chaos, typically
exhibiting volume-law scaling in highly excited eigenstates of chaotic
many-body systems. In this work, we present a striking counterexample: a
Floquet-driven quantum many-body system with Rydberg-like blockade that,
despite being fully chaotic as indicated by its Wigner-Dyson level statistics
and local thermalization, exhibits a strict area-law entanglement entropy.
Specifically, the entanglement entropy of every Floquet eigenstate is bounded
by $\ln2$, independent of system size. We trace this anomaly to the specific
Hilbert space structure imposed by the blockades, which restricts the Schmidt
rank across a bipartition. Furthermore, we generalize this discovery by
establishing a duality between constrained many-body Hamiltonians and
single-particle quantum walks on median graphs, and we outline a general
procedure for constructing systems with an entanglement entropy bounded by a
predetermined constant. Our results demonstrate that entanglement entropy alone
is an insufficient diagnostic of many-body quantum chaos and highlight the
profound impact of Hilbert space geometry on quantum dynamics and
thermalization.

Conclusion: The experimental setup for efficient channel purification, utilizing spatial and polarization properties of photons, demonstrates superior noise suppression and entanglement preservation compared to conventional methods.

Abstract: Quantum networks, which integrate multiple quantum computers and the channels
connecting them, are crucial for distributed quantum information processing but
remain inherently susceptible to channel noise. Channel purification emerges as
a promising technique for suppressing noise in quantum channels without complex
encoding and decoding operations, making it particularly suitable for remote

an experimental setup for efficient channel purification, harnessing the

achieving effective noise suppression across a wide range of noise levels and

Conclusion: 纠缠在能量约束的SDI场景中具有显著影响，可能降低随机性认证的效果，并在量子通道区分任务中突破现有边界。

Abstract: Quantum information tasks are often analyzed under varying trust assumptions
about the devices involved. The semi-device-independent (SDI) framework offers
a balance between needed assumptions and experimental feasibility. In this
work, we study the energy-constrained SDI scenario, where the only assumption
in a prepare-and-measure setup is an upper bound on the energy of the prepared
quantum states. In contrast to previous studies that restricted the preparation
and measurement devices to be classically correlated, we show that allowing
entanglement strictly enlarges the set of achievable correlations. We identify
two operational consequences of this result. The first concerns randomness
certification, where we show that allowing the adversary to employ entangled
strategies may significantly reduce the amount of certifiable randomness. This
includes situations where the amount of randomness drops to zero in the
presence of entanglement, while it remains positive when entanglement is
excluded. Second, for the task of distinguishing an arbitrary quantum channel
from the identity, we show that the known dimension-independent bound on the
advantage conferred by entanglement is violated under an energy constraint.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the quantum optical scattering of two-photon wavepackets by a lossy sphere, focusing on the interference effects arising from non-collinearity and spectral symmetry of the photons.

Method: The research employs macroscopic quantum electrodynamics via modified Langevin noise formalism to analyze the scattering of two-photon wavepackets by a macroscopic lossy sphere. It explores the impact of matter dispersion and losses on quantum interference effects.

Result: The findings reveal strong constructive and destructive interference effects at Mie resonance frequencies, with scattering probabilities of two, one, and zero photons showing sensitivity to the input wavepacket's spectral symmetry.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that quantum interference effects in the scattering of two-photon wavepackets by a lossy sphere are highly sensitive to the spectral symmetry of the input wavepacket. This suggests a potential spectral technique for identifying entanglement, assisted by matter losses.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum optical scattering of two-photon wavepackets by a
macroscopic lossy sphere by means of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics in the
form of modified Langevin noise formalism. The two ingoing photons with
arbitrary frequency-polarization spectrum impinge onto the sphere along two
different directions and, as consequence of matter losses, their scattering
involves the three independent processes where two, one and zero outgoing
photons survive. Non-collinearity of ingoing photons causes the existence of
two different quantum paths they can follow upon scattering, this producing
interference effects in the detection of the above three processes which is
governed by the wavepacket spectral symmetry. By exploiting rotational
invariance, we show that different classes of scattering geometries exist such
that the coincidence detection of the scattered photons shows perfect
constructive or destructive (Hong-Ou-Mandel) interference, both for symmetric
and antisymmetric wavepackets. To assess the impact of matter dispersion/losses
on quantum interference effects accompanying photons detection, we analyze the
scattering of narrow band two-photon wavepackets by high-index dielectric lossy
spheres. We show that classical Mie resonance peaks, due to their Fano-like
traits, yield very strong constructive and destructive interference effects,
occurring when the wavepacket carrier frequency matches the resonance frequency
and side Fano dip frequency, respectively. In addition we consider the overall
scattering probabilities of two, one and zero photons and we prove that, at the
Mie resonance frequencies, they exhibit quantum interference effects which are
extremely sensitive to the spectral symmetry of the input wavepacket, thus
suggesting an efficient spectral technique assisted by matter losses to
identify entanglement.

TL;DR: A 4-wave-mixing scheme in Rydberg arrays enables efficient, directional terahertz-to-optical photon transduction, with potential applications in quantum sensing and spectroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an efficient and highly directional single-photon transduction method for terahertz-to-optical conversion, addressing the need for quantum-coherent THz detection and processing in various applications.

Method: The scheme utilizes 4-wave-mixing and quantum scattering in planar, cooperative Rydberg arrays, with two lasers driving the system to coherently trap it in a dark ground-state and couple signal and idler transitions. A scattering-operator formalism is used to derive resonance and criticality conditions.

Result: For infinite lattices, transduction efficiencies of up to 50% into specific spatial directions are predicted, with higher overall efficiencies. Finite arrays show collimated output into narrowing lobes as emitter count increases.

Conclusion: The proposed single-photon transduction scheme combines the advantages of free-space 4-wave mixing with cooperative metasurfaces, offering a promising route for quantum-coherent THz detection and processing in applications like astronomical spectroscopy and quantum sensing.

Abstract: We present a single-photon transduction scheme using 4-wave-mixing and
quantum scattering in planar, cooperative Rydberg arrays that is both efficient
and highly directional and may allow for terahertz-to-optical transduction. In
the 4-wave-mixing scheme, two lasers drive the system, coherently trapping the
system in a dark ground-state and coupling a signal transition, that may be in
the terahertz, to an idler transition that may be in the optical. The
photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions between emitters generate collective
super-/subradiant dipolar modes, both on the signal and the idler transition.
As the array is cooperative with respect to the signal transition, an incident
signal photon can efficiently couple into the array and is admixed into dipolar
idler modes by the drive. Under specific criticality conditions, this admixture
is into a superradiant idler mode which primarily decays into a specific,
highly directional optical photon that propagates within the array plane.
Outside of the array, this photon may then be coupled into existing quantum
devices for further processing. Using a scattering-operator formalism we derive
resonance and criticality conditions that govern this two-step process and
obtain analytic transduction efficiencies. For infinite lattices, we predict
transduction efficiencies into specific spatial directions of up to 50%, while
the overall, undirected transduction efficiency can be higher. An analysis for
finite arrays of $N^2$ emitters, shows that the output is collimated into lobes
that narrow as $1/\sqrt{N}$. Our scheme combines the broadband acceptance of
free-space 4-wave mixing with the efficiency, directionality and tunability of
cooperative metasurfaces, offering a route towards quantum-coherent THz
detection and processing for astronomical spectroscopy, quantum-networked
sparse-aperture imaging and other quantum-sensing applications.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the proposed squeezing gate, utilizing amplitude transmission coefficients of unbalanced beam splitters and homodyne detection with feed-forward, outperforms current methods. This approach paves the way for low-noise squeezing gates in practical cluster state implementations.

Abstract: The one-way quantum computation utilizing bosonic modes of light offers
unmatched scalability of light modes, and it has seen rapid experimental
development recently. Scalability requires robust and low-error gates and
measurements. Squeezing gate is one of the necessary Gaussian operations. We
find the optimal squeezing gate in cluster state architecture. Our approach
newly uses amplitude transmission coefficients of unbalanced beam splitters and

Result: The results show that private randomness can be locally extracted from residual states in QKD protocols, with achievable rates provided for the Gottesman-Lo protocol.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that repurposing residual states in quantum information tasks can significantly enhance resource utility, as demonstrated through the extraction of private randomness from discarded states in QKD protocols.

Abstract: We propose a framework for quantum residual management, in which states
discarded after a resource distillation process are repurposed as inputs for
subsequent quantum information tasks. This approach extends conventional
quantum resource theories by incorporating secondary resource extraction from
residual states, thereby enhancing overall resource utility. As a concrete
example, we investigate the distillation of private randomness from the
residual states remaining after quantum key distribution (QKD). More
specifically, we quantitatively show that after performing a well-known
coherent Devetak-Winter protocol one can locally extract private randomness
from its residual. We further consider the Gottesman-Lo QKD protocol, and
provide the achievable rate of private randomness from the discarded states
that are left after its performance. We also provide a formal framework that
highlights a general principle for improving quantum resource utilization

Motivation: Inspired by deterministic oscillator models, the study aims to explore stochastic interactions in a chain of particles, particularly focusing on how local interactions can induce long-range effects and the role of different baths in governing particle dynamics.

Method: The model consists of $N$ oscillators performing continuous-time random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ with exponentially distributed waiting times. The oscillators interact through quadratic or Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type couplings, and hopping rates are governed by the Metropolis rule or a modified version that breaks detailed balance.

Result: The model shows that local interactions in index space can result in effective long-range interactions on the spatial lattice, with particle dynamics significantly affected by the choice of hopping rates and bath conditions.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a stochastic one-dimensional model for interacting particles, demonstrating how local interactions in index space can lead to effective long-range interactions on the spatial lattice. The model's behavior is influenced by the choice of hopping rates and the presence of baths with different inverse temperatures.

Abstract: Inspired by recent studies on deterministic oscillator models, we introduce a
stochastic one-dimensional model for a chain of interacting particles. The
model consists of $N$ oscillators performing continuous-time random walks on
the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ with exponentially distributed waiting times.
The oscillators are bound by confining forces to two particles that do not
move, placed at positions $x_0$ and $x_{N+1}$, respectively, and they feel the
presence of baths with given inverse temperatures: $\beta_L$ to the left,
$\beta_B$ in the middle, and $\beta_R$ to the right. Each particle has an index
and interacts with its nearest neighbors in index space through either a
quadratic potential or a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type coupling. This local
interaction in index space can give rise to effective long-range interactions
on the spatial lattice, depending on the instantaneous configuration. Particle
hopping rates are governed either by the Metropolis rule or by a modified
version that breaks detailed balance at the interfaces between regions with
different baths.

### [30] [When Normality Tests Detect Equilibrium Distributions of Finite N-Body Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26821)
*Jae Wan Shim*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper uses particle number $N$ to measure non-Gaussianity in finite systems, tests normality with Monte-Carlo simulations, and provides detection guidelines for finite-size effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore how non-Gaussianity in finite particle systems can be measured using the particle number $N$, and to determine when finite-size effects remain detectable in such systems.

Method: A large-scale Monte-Carlo study was conducted to analyze the statistical power of five standard normality tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cramér-von Mises, Jarque-Bera, and Shapiro-Wilk) across varying system sizes $N$ and sample sizes $n$.

Result: The velocity distribution of an ideal gas with finite $N$ deviates from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form, and the study maps the statistical power of normality tests to detect these deviations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that finite-size effects in particle systems can be quantitatively gauged using the particle number $N$, and provides practical reference tables for detecting these effects through standard normality tests.

Abstract: The particle number $N$ can be used as a quantitative gauge of
non-Gaussianity. This idea extends to systems that are not literally finite by
assigning them a notional $N $that captures the same deviation. For an ideal
gas with $N$ insufficiently large for the thermodynamic limit, the velocity
distribution that maximises Havrda-Charv\'at entropy departs markedly from the
Maxwell-Boltzmann (Gaussian) form obtained in that limit. We explore how five
standard normality tests-Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cram\'er-von
Mises, Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilk-respond to samples drawn from this
finite-$N$ equilibrium distribution. A large-scale Monte-Carlo study maps the
tests' statistical power across system size $N$ and sample size $n$, providing
practical reference tables for deciding when finite-size effects remain
detectable.

TL;DR: Time-reversal symmetry breaking in integrable chiral spin ladders leads to superdiffusive transport but not full KPZ universality, suggesting missing dynamics features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of time-reversal symmetry breaking on transport and its universal aspects in integrable systems.

Method: Study of integrable chiral spin ladders and introduction of an integrable quantum circuit to investigate the role of conserved quantities.

Result: Superdiffusive spin transport with a dynamical critical exponent z = 3/2, matching KPZ universality, but deviations in magnetization transfer fluctuations and adherence to fluctuation symmetry despite broken symmetries.

Conclusion: Time-reversal symmetry breaking is compatible with superdiffusion but insufficient to stabilize the KPZ universality in integrable systems, indicating missing fundamental features for such dynamics in quantum matter.

Abstract: Symmetries strongly influence transport properties of quantum many-body
systems, and can lead to deviations from the generic case of diffusion. In this
work, we study the impact of time-reversal symmetry breaking on the transport
and its universal aspects in integrable chiral spin ladders. We observe that
the infinite-temperature spin transport is superdiffusive with a dynamical
critical exponent z = 3/2 matching the one of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
universality class, which also lacks the time reversal symmetry. However, we
find that fluctuations of the net magnetization transfer deviate from the KPZ
predictions. Moreover, the full probability distribution of the associated spin
current obeys fluctuation symmetry despite broken time-reversal and
space-reflection symmetries. To further investigate the role of conserved
quantities, we introduce an integrable quantum circuit that shares the
essential symmetries with the chiral ladder, and which exhibits analogous
dynamical behaviour in the absence of energy conservation. Our work shows that
time-reversal symmetry breaking is compatible with superdiffusion, but
insufficient to stabilize the KPZ universality in integrable systems. This
suggests that additional fundamental features are missing in order to identify
the emergence of such dynamics in quantum matter.

Conclusion: 本文通过几何视角提出了新的概念，如扰动梯度流系统的模空间和热力学面积，这些概念对于理解速度限制至关重要。作者希望鼓励两个领域的研究者进一步扩展和促进这两个领域的互动。

Abstract: This article serves to concisely review the link between gradient flow
systems on hypergraphs and information geometry which has been established
within the last five years. Gradient flow systems describe a wealth of physical
phenomena and provide powerful analytical technquies which are based on the
variational energy-dissipation principle. Modern nonequilbrium physics has
complemented this classical principle with thermodynamic uncertaintly
relations, speed limits, entropy production rate decompositions, and many more.
In this article, we formulate these modern principles within the framework of
perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs. In particular, we discuss the
geometry induced by the Bregman divergence, the physical implications of dual
foliations, as well as the corresponding infinitesimal Riemannian geometry for
gradient flow systems. Through the geometrical perspective, we are naturally
led to new concepts such as moduli spaces for perturbed gradient flow systems
and thermodynamical area which is crucial for understanding speed limits. We
hope to encourage the readers working in either of the two fields to further
expand on and foster the interaction between the two fields.

Method: 分析了包含热力学力的非线性广义朗之万方程，并展示了其自相关函数的非平稳性。

Conclusion: 在向朗之万方程中添加热力学驱动力时需要谨慎处理，以避免预测结果与原始微观过程不符。

Abstract: We analyze the non-linear generalized Langevin equation which contains a
thermodynamic force. We show that even for systems in thermal equilibrium the
presence of the thermodynamic force implies that the auto-correlation function
of the fluctuating force becomes non-stationary. We further illustrate that a
standard coarse-graining procedure that neglects this fact predicts
waiting-time distributions incompatible with the original, microscopic process.
We conclude that one needs to proceed with care when adding thermodynamic
driving forces to the Langevin equation.

Abstract: This research provides a framework for describing the averaged modulus of the
velocity reached by an accelerated self-propelled Brownian particle diffusing
in a thermal fluid and constrained to a harmonic external potential. The system
is immersed in a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators at a constant
temperature, where its constituents also interact with the external field. The
dynamics is investigated for a sphere and a disk, and is split into two
stochastic processes. The first describes the gross-grained inner
time-dependent self-velocity generated from a set of independent
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes without the influence of the external field. This
internal mechanism provides the initial velocity for the particle to diffuse in
the fluid, which is implemented in a modified generalized Langevin equation as
the second process. We find that the system exhibits spontaneous fluctuations
in the diffusive velocity modulus due to the inner mechanism; however, as
expected, the momentary diffusive velocity fluctuations fade out at large
times. The internal propelled velocity module in spherical coordinates is
derived, as well as the simulation of the different modules for both the sphere
and the already known equations for a disk in polar coordinates.

TL;DR: A real-space path-integral Monte Carlo method for dipole polarizability in Coulomb plasma shows promise for optical and quantum applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional dynamic structure factor methods in reciprocal space, especially for long wavelengths and small cell sizes, including finite clusters.

Method: The approach is based on the real-space dipole autocorrelation function, simulating thermal equilibrium in imaginary time with exact Coulomb interactions and Boltzmann quantum statistics.

Result: The method demonstrates perfect agreement with the Drude model in finite temperature and density ranges, with modest effects from finite time-step and finite-size parameters.

Conclusion: The presented path-integral Monte Carlo estimator is validated against an exactly solvable reference and shows potential for broader applications in higher-order optical response, quantum confinements, and nonlinear optics.

Abstract: We present a path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for calculating the dipole
polarizability of interacting Coulomb plasma in the long-wavelength limit,
i.e., the optical region. Unlike the conventional dynamic structure factor in
reciprocal space, our approach is based on the real-space dipole
autocorrelation function and is suited for long wavelengths and small cell
sizes, including finite clusters. The simulation of thermal equilibrium in
imaginary time has exact Coulomb interactions and Boltzmann quantum statistics.
For reference, we demonstrate analytic continuation of the Drude model into the
imaginary time and Matsubara series, showing perfect agreement with our data
within ranges of finite temperatures and densities. Method parameters, such as
the finite time-step and finite-size effects prove only modestly significant.
Our method, here carefully validated against an exactly solvable reference,
remains amenable to more interesting domains in higher-order optical response,
quantum confinements and quantum statistical effects, and applications in
plasmonics, heterogeneous plasmas and nonlinear optics, such as
epsilon-near-zero materials.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum processors have potential to scale to modular quantum
computers, in which qubit registers are coupled by quantum links, enabling high
connectivity and space for control circuitry. Individual spin-qubit registers
have progressed to two-dimensional systems and execution of small quantum
algorithms. Separately, high-fidelity spin shuttling has been demonstrated in
linear channels defined by individual gate electrodes. Here, we realize the
first shared-control shuttling link integrated between distant qubit registers
to demonstrate quantum entanglement in a basic modular quantum processor based
on hole spin qubits in germanium. We develop a protocol to compensate for
spin-orbit-induced rotations during qubit transfer, allowing for shuttling
between qubit registers separated by more than one micrometer in approximately
a hundred nanoseconds. Combining local qubit operation with coherent shuttling,
we generate Bell states formed by spins residing in separate registers.
Characterizing them using quantum state tomography, we demonstrate entanglement
between spin qubits in distant registers.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper investigates Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O under varying temperature and excitation power, finding P excitons more sensitive to power changes than D excitons, likely due to internal electric fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to explore the response of Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O to different experimental conditions, specifically temperature and excitation power, to understand their sensitivity and underlying mechanisms.

Method: The researchers extended the experimental parameter space by varying temperature and excitation power, observing the absorption lines of excitons with principal quantum numbers up to n=29 at low laser intensities.

Result: The results showed that P excitons near the band gap are more sensitive to increased excitation power compared to D excitons, despite the latter being at higher energy. Absorption lines for excitons with n=29 were observed at laser intensities below 1 $\mu$W/cm$^2$.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the behavior of P excitons and D excitons under varying temperature and excitation power is influenced by internal electric fields generated by optically ionized charged impurities. This is analogous to the effects observed under external electric fields.

Abstract: Rydberg excitons in the semiconductor Cu$_2$O have been observed in
absorption experiments up to a principal quantum number of n = 28 at
millikelvin temperatures [1]. Here, we extend the experimental parameter space
by variing both temperature and excitation power. In particular, we show that
the P excitons close to the band gap react more sensitively to an increase of
the excitation power than states of the associated D exciton multiplet, even
though the latter are located at comparatively higher energy. This finding is
similar to the one observed when applying an external electric field,
suggesting that the observed behavior arises from internal electric fields
created by charged impurities that are optically ionized. At laser intensities
below 1 $\mu$W/cm$^2$, absorption lines of excitons with n=29 are observed.

Conclusion: PCA技术通过分析非对称特征向量，能够更精确地识别非平衡系统中的无序相，并且可以扩展到其他具有时间依赖动态的非平衡系统。

Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful method that can identify
patterns in large, complex data sets by constructing low-dimensional order
parameters from higher-dimensional feature vectors. There are increasing
efforts to use space-and-time-dependent PCA to detect transitions in
nonequilibrium systems that are difficult to characterize with equilibrium
methods. Here, we demonstrate that feature vectors incorporating the position
and velocity information of driven skyrmions moving through random disorder
permit PCA to resolve different types of disordered skyrmion motion as a
function of driving force and the ratio of the Magnus force to the dissipation.
Since the Magnus force creates gyroscopic motion and a finite Hall angle,
skyrmions can exhibit a greater range of flow phases than what is observed in
overdamped driven systems with quenched disorder. We show that in addition to
identifying previously known skyrmion flow phases, PCA detects several
additional phases, including different types of channel flow, moving fluids,
and partially ordered states. Guided by the PCA analysis, we further
characterize the disordered flow phases to elucidate the different microscopic
dynamics and show that the changes in the PCA-derived order parameters can be
connected to features in bulk transport measures, including the transverse and
longitudinal velocity-force curves, differential conductivity, topological
defect density, and changes in the skyrmion Hall angle as a function of drive.
We discuss how asymmetric feature vectors can be used to improve the resolution
of the PCA analysis, and how this technique can be extended to find disordered
phases in other nonequilibrium systems with time-dependent dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the optical phenomena and electro-optic responses in topological chiral crystals, particularly focusing on the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment textures around chiral band crossings.

Method: The research employs tight-binding models and first-principles calculations to analyze the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons across 37 materials in SG198.

Result: The findings reveal a nonzero Berry curvature dipole in SG198 materials, attributed to energetic misalignment of topologically charged point nodes, and identify BeAu as a candidate for observable magnetoelectric electro-optic effects under feasible electric biases.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that topological chiral crystals in SG198 exhibit nonzero Berry curvature dipole and accessible magnetoelectric electro-optic effects, challenging previous assumptions and expanding the potential applications of these materials.

Abstract: Topological chiral crystals have emerged as a fertile material platform for
investigating optical phenomena derived from the distinctive Fermi surface
Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment textures around multifold chiral
band crossings pinned at the time-reversal invariant momenta. In this work, by
means of tight-binding model and first principles based calculations, we
investigate metallic electro-optic (EO) responses stemming from the Berry
curvature and orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons across 37 materials
belonging to space group 198 (SG198). Previously thought to vanish in SG198,
our findings reveal a nonzero Berry curvature dipole attributed to the
energetic misalignment between topologically charged point nodes of opposite
chirality. Moreover, we find that the recently predicted magnetoelectric EO
effects, which arise from the interplay between the Berry curvature and
magnetic moment on the Fermi surface, are readily accessible in BeAu under
experimentally feasible electric biases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to deepen the understanding of chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) and explore its potential applications in advanced electronic devices.

Method: Time-dependent quantum-transport simulations were used to investigate the transient CISS dynamics in chiral molecules.

Result: The simulations revealed that spin polarization in chiral molecules is maintained in the steady state when connected to two leads, and the results qualitatively matched experimental data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a nonzero spin polarization in chiral molecules is due to spin-dependent electron group velocities, and this polarization persists in the steady state when connected to two leads. The findings align with experimental observations, supporting the potential application of CISS in devices like magnetoresistive memories and quantum computers.

Abstract: Chiral molecules are known to preferentially select electrons with a
particular spin state, an effect termed chirality-induced spin selectivity
(CISS). In this work, the transient CISS dynamics in a chiral molecule are
investigated through time-dependent quantum-transport simulations, an important
step toward further understanding CISS and its application in devices such as
magnetoresistive random access memories and spin-based quantum computers. We
show that a nonzero spin polarization throughout the chiral molecule can be
attributed to a spin-dependent group velocity of electrons. Contrary to the
case where a chiral molecule is connected to a single lead, this spin
polarization persists into the steady state when two leads are connected. We
show that the simulated spin polarization qualitatively agrees with a reference
experiment, as evidenced by the distinct magnetic-field signatures calculated
from the spin polarization within a monolayer of chiral molecules.

Motivation: To understand the anomalous Nernst and Hall conductance in Kagome metal potassium tri vanadium pentantimonide and explore the system's topological features.

Method: Theoretical analysis using a system Hamiltonian incorporating nearest neighbour and complex next nearest neighbour hopping, Rashba spin orbit coupling, an exchange field, and a charge density wave potential.

Result: The Nernst conductivity shows a non-monotonic temperature dependence, with a peak followed by a decline due to thermal broadening. Chemical potential shifts dramatically affect the Nernst signal. The system exhibits significant Berry curvature accumulation, with some bands acquiring opposite Chern numbers under momentum space winding.

Conclusion: The study highlights the sensitivity of the Nernst signal to chemical potential shifts and reveals significant Berry curvature accumulation in the system, with some bands acquiring opposite Chern numbers under specific conditions.

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the anomalous Nernst and Hall conductance
in the Kagome metal potassium tri vanadium pentantimonide, based on a system
Hamiltonian incorporating nearest neighbour and complex next nearest neighbour
hopping, Rashba spin orbit coupling, an exchange field induced by magnetic
proximity, and a charge density wave potential. Our analysis reveals that the
Nernst conductivity exhibits a non monotonic temperature dependence. It
increases with temperature, reaches a pronounced peak, and subsequently
declines at higher temperatures due to thermal broadening, which diminishes the
influence of Berry curvature. Notably, small shifts in the chemical potential
can lead to dramatic changes in the Nernst signal enhancing its magnitude or
even reversing its sign highlighting the system sensitivity to carrier density.
We further explore the anomalous Hall behaviour within this framework. The band
structure hosts multiple bands with nonzero Berry curvature, and preliminary
Chern number calculations suggest weak topological features, namely, while not
fully quantized, the system exhibits significant Berry curvature accumulation.
Upon introducing momentum space winding, implemented via a momentum dependent
phase in the complex hopping terms to mimic orbital magnetic flux, we observe
that two bands acquire opposite Chern numbers. The remaining bands remain
topologically trivial.

Abstract: Light pulses offer a faster, more energy-efficient, and direct route to
magnetic bit writing, pointing toward a hybrid memory and computing paradigm
based on photon transmission and spin retention. Yet progress remains hindered,
as deterministic, single-pulse optical toggle switching has so far been
achieved only with ferrimagnetic materials, which require too specific a
rare-earth composition and temperature conditions for technological use. In
mainstream ferromagnet--central to spintronic memory and storage--such bistable
switching is considered fundamentally difficult, as laser-induced heating does
not inherently break time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report coherent
magnetization switching in ferromagnets, driven by thermal anisotropy torque
with single laser pulses. The toggle switching behavior is robust over a broad
range of pulse durations, from femtoseconds to picoseconds, a prerequisite for
practical applications. Furthermore, the phenomenon exhibits reproducibility in
CoFeB/MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions with a high magnetoresistance
exceeding 110%, as well as the scalability down to nanoscales with remarkable
energy efficiency (17 fJ per 100-nm-sized bit). These results mark a notable
step toward integrating opto-spintronics into next-generation memory and

TL;DR: The paper presents a cavity electro-acoustic platform using phononic-crystal resonators on lithium niobate, achieving atomic-like transitions and non-reciprocal frequency conversions, with potential applications in quantum technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mechanical systems are crucial in quantum technologies due to their long coherent time and versatile coupling to qubit systems. The aim is to achieve coherent and dynamic control of gigahertz-frequency mechanical modes, which has previously relied on optomechanical and piezoelectric coupling to superconducting qubits.

Method: The study leverages the high dispersion of phononic-crystal (PnC) resonators to space phononic modes unevenly in the frequency spectrum, emulating atomic energy levels. Electrical fields are applied to modulate phononic modes via the nonlinear piezoelectricity of lithium niobate (LN), achieving atomic-like transitions between modes.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates Autler-Townes splitting (ATS), alternating current (a.c.) Stark shift, and Rabi oscillation between two modes with a maximum cooperativity of 4.18. Extending to three modes, non-reciprocal frequency conversions with isolation up to 20 dB are achieved, with nonreciprocity tunable by the time delay between modulating pulses.

Conclusion: The demonstrated cavity electro-acoustic platform, utilizing microwave-frequency electrically-modulated phononic-crystal resonators on lithium niobate, shows potential for broad applications in sensing, microwave signal processing, phononic computing, and quantum acoustics.

Abstract: Mechanical systems are pivotal in quantum technologies because of their long
coherent time and versatile coupling to qubit systems. So far, the coherent and
dynamic control of gigahertz-frequency mechanical modes mostly relies on
optomechanical coupling and piezoelectric coupling to superconducting qubits.
Here, we demonstrate on-chip cavity electro-acoustic dynamics using our
microwave-frequency electrically-modulated phononic-crystal (PnC) resonators on
lithium niobate (LN). Leveraging the high dispersion of PnC, our phononic modes
space unevenly in the frequency spectrum, emulating atomic energy levels.
Atomic-like transitions between different phononic modes are achieved by
applying electrical fields to modulate phononic modes via nonlinear
piezoelectricity of LN. Among two modes, we demonstrate Autler-Townes splitting
(ATS), alternating current (a.c.) Stark shift, and Rabi oscillation with a
maximum cooperativity of 4.18. Extending to three modes, we achieve
non-reciprocal frequency conversions with an isolation up to 20 dB.
Nonreciprocity can be tuned by the time delay between the two modulating
pulses. Our cavity electro-acoustic platform could find broad applications in
sensing, microwave signal processing, phononic computing, and quantum
acoustics.

### [44] [Engineering Biquadratic Interactions in Spin-1 Chains by Spin-1/2 Spacers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26956)

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to engineer unconventional spin interactions in quantum simulators using nanographene flakes, enabling control over exotic quantum states like the AKLT state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to realize exotic quantum states, such as the AKLT state, in practical quantum simulators by controlling unconventional spin interactions that do not naturally emerge from microscopic interactions.

Method: The researchers demonstrated a strategy to induce and tune a biquadratic term between spin-1 sites by placing pairs of spin-1/2 spacers, controlling the strength of the term via Heisenberg coupling ratios. Atomistic calculations were performed on nanographene flake chains.

Result: The study found that the biquadratic term's strength can be tuned, leading to a quantum phase transition between spin-liquid phases with hidden antiferromagnetic order. Nanographene flakes were identified as suitable materials for achieving the required couplings.

Conclusion: The study provides a blueprint for engineering unconventional spin interactions in quantum simulators using bottom-up synthesized materials, specifically nanographene flakes, to approach the AKLT state.

Abstract: Low-dimensional quantum systems host a variety of exotic states, such as
symmetry-protected topological ground states in spin-1 Haldane chains.
Real-world realizations of such states could serve as practical quantum
simulators for quantum phases if the interactions can be controlled. However,
many proposed models, such as the AKLT state, require unconventional forms of
spin interactions beyond standard Heisenberg terms, which do not naturally
emerge from microscopic (Coulomb) interactions. Here, we demonstrate a general
strategy to induce a biquadratic term between two spin-1 sites and to tune its
strength $\beta$ by placing pairs of spin-1/2 spacers in between them. $\beta$
is controlled by the ratio between Heisenberg couplings to and in between the
spacer spins. Increasing this ratio first increases the magnitude of $\beta$
and decreases the correlation length of edge states, but at a critical value of
the ratio, we observe a quantum phase transition between two spin-liquid phases
with hidden antiferromagnetic order. Detailed atomistic calculations reveal
that chains of nanographene flakes with 22 and 13 atoms, respectively, which
could be realized by state-of-the-art bottom-up growth technology, yield
precisely the couplings required to approach the AKLT state. These findings
deliver a blueprint for engineering unconventional interactions in bottom-up
synthesized quantum simulators.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Thermoelectric study on moiré heavy fermions reveals entropic insights through Seebeck coefficient changes, showing phase transitions and entropy accumulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of quantitative thermoelectric measurements in moiré materials, which can reveal entropic information of heavy fermions, this study aims to fill this gap.

Method: A comprehensive thermoelectric study was conducted on hole-doped angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers, focusing on the Kondo lattice region by electrical gating. The Seebeck coefficient was analyzed to observe phase transitions.

Result: A sign change in the Seebeck coefficient near the Kondo coherence temperature was observed, indicating a transition from a heavy fermion phase to an itinerant Fermi liquid. A strong peak in the Seebeck coefficient near the Zeeman breakdown of Kondo singlets was also noted, signaling entropy accumulation.

Conclusion: The study provides entropic insights into the formation and breakdown of heavy fermions in moiré semiconductors, revealing key thermodynamic signatures through thermoelectric measurements.

Abstract: Tunable Kondo lattice and heavy fermion physics have been recently reported
in moir\'e materials, but most of the studies have focused on the electrical
and magnetic properties. Quantitative thermoelectric measurements, which can
reveal entropic information of the heavy fermions, have yet to be achieved.
Here, we report a comprehensive thermoelectric study on the moir\'e heavy
fermion phase realized in hole-doped angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers. By
electrically gating the material to the Kondo lattice region of the phase
diagram, we observe a sign change in the Seebeck coefficient near the Kondo
coherence temperature, where the heavy fermion phase with an electron-like
Fermi surface evolves into an itinerant Fermi liquid with a hole-like Fermi
surface. We compare the results with the semiclassical Mott relation and
discuss the observed discrepancies. In addition to the thermal dissociation of
Kondo singlets in the heavy Fermi liquid, a sign change accompanied by a strong
peak in the Seebeck coefficient is also observed near a Zeeman breakdown of the
Kondo singlets, signaling an entropy accumulation. Our results provide entropic
information on both the formation and breakdown of heavy fermions in moir\'e
semiconductors.

*Hirohito Aizawa*

TL;DR: The paper studies λ-(BETS)₂GaCl₄'s magnetic properties, revealing a temperature-dependent shift from AFM to SDW-like fluctuations, consistent with experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the magnetic properties of the quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor λ-(BETS)₂GaCl₄ and understand the dominant magnetic fluctuations at different temperatures.

Method: A multi-band Hubbard model and the two-particle self-consistent method were used, employing both a four-band model (each BETS molecule as a site) and a two-band model (each BETS dimer as a site).

Result: The temperature dependence of the Stoner factor revealed a kink around 5 meV, indicating a change in magnetic fluctuations. Above this temperature, smeared AFM fluctuations were observed, while below it, SDW-like fluctuations dominated. Increasing the intra-dimer transfer integral eliminated the kink and enhanced AFM fluctuations.

Conclusion: The study's findings align with experimental observations, showing a transition from antiferromagnetic (AFM) to spin-density-wave (SDW)-like fluctuations as temperature decreases, with the disappearance of the kink as intra-dimer transfer integral increases.

Abstract: We have theoretically investigated the magnetic properties of the
quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor $\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$ using a
multi-band Hubbard model and the two-particle self-consistent method. We have
employed a four-band model, where each BETS molecule is considered as a site,
and a two-band model, treating each BETS dimer as a site. Our results for the
temperature dependence of the Stoner factor reveal a kink around
$T_\mathrm{kink} \approx 5 \mathrm{meV}$, indicating a change in the dominant
magnetic fluctuations. Above $T_\mathrm{kink}$, it shows a broad structure
indicating smeared antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations, while below
$T_\mathrm{kink}$, the spin susceptibility peaks at a wavevector corresponding
to spin-density-wave (SDW)-like fluctuations. As the intra-dimer transfer
integral increases, the kink disappears, and the AFM fluctuations are enhanced.
Our findings are consistent with experimental observations, which also report a
change in magnetic properties from AFM to SDW-like fluctuations upon cooling.

*Shun-Qing Shen*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper shows that half-quantized Hall conductivity is absent for massive Dirac fermions on a lattice, appearing only with massless Dirac cones, redefining the parity anomaly's scope.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the mechanism for half-quantized Hall responses in systems described by massive Dirac fermions.

Method: Reexamining the issue on a lattice with proper regularization and translational invariant symmetry.

Result: A single massive Dirac cone on a lattice leads to integer quantized Hall conductivity, while half-quantized Hall conductivity appears only with massless Dirac cones.

Conclusion: The parity anomaly is a property of massless Dirac fermions in a semimetal/metal, not of massive Dirac fermions in an insulator on a lattice.

Abstract: The parity anomaly for Dirac fermions in two spatial dimensions has shaped
perspectives in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. In condensed
matter it has evolved as a mechanism for half-quantized Hall responses in
systems described by massive Dirac fermions. Here we reexamine the issue on a
lattice and show that the half-quantized Hall conductivity is absent for
massive Dirac fermions when lattice regularization is properly implemented and
the translational invariant symmetry is taken into account. We realize that a
single massive Dirac cone on a lattice always leads to an integer quantized
Hall conductivity and to the half-quantized Hall conductivity only in the
unphysical limit of infinite momentum cut-off. The half-quantized Hall
conductivity appears with nonzero longitudinal conductance as a signature of a
single massless Dirac cone on a lattice. Consequently, the parity anomaly is a
property of massless Dirac fermions in a semimetal/metal, not of massive Dirac
fermions in an insulator on a lattice.

*Anuradha Jagannathan*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explores magnetic ordering in quasicrystals and approximants using cluster spin models, identifying novel magnetic phases and motivating further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To elucidate the role of quasiperiodicity in stabilizing or destabilizing long-range magnetic order by systematically studying magnetic alloys.

Method: The research employs cluster spin models that embody key features of real systems, focusing on both periodic and quasiperiodic cases.

Result: Two novel magnetic phases with quasiperiodic ordering are described for quasicrystals.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of cluster spin models in understanding magnetic ordering in approximants and quasicrystals, motivating further detailed numerical explorations.

Abstract: Many new families of quasicrystal-forming magnetic alloys have been
synthesized and studied in recent years. For small changes of composition, the
alloys can go from quasiperiodic to periodic (approximant crystals) while
conserving most of the local atomic environments. Experiments show that many of
the periodic approximants order at low temperatures, with clear signatures of
ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic transitions, and also in some cases undergo
non-equilibrium spin glass transitions. In contrast, the quasicrystals are
mostly found to be spin glasses. Systematically studying these alloys could
help elucidate the role played by quasiperiodicity in (de)stabilizing long
range magnetic order. In this work, we study cluster spin models with the aim
of understanding the mechanisms behind various types of long range magnetic
ordering in approximants and quasicrystals. These models embody key features of
real systems, and to some extent are analytically tractable, both for periodic
and quasiperiodic cases. For the quasicrystal, we describe two novel magnetic
phases with quasiperiodic ordering. Our results should serve to motivate
further studies with detailed numerical explorations of this family of models.

Conclusion: 通过简单模型解释了各向异性场的跳跃，并揭示了新的AFMR模式与长周期非共格态相关。

Abstract: The multiferroic ferroborate GdFe$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ with huntite-type structure
exhibits magnetic ordering below T$_N$ = 38 K and contains two magnetic
subsystems associated with Gd and Fe ions. Competing anisotropies of these
subsystems drive a spin reorientation transition at T$_{SR}$ = 10.7 K,
switching the ground state from easy-axis to easy-plane. Using
antiferromagnetic resonance, we investigate the spin dynamics across this
transition. The observed incomplete softening of a magnon mode during both
field- and temperature-induced spin-reorientation transitions indicates the
first-order nature of the phase transition, which is accompanied by a
discontinuous jump in the effective anisotropy field. We reproduce this
behavior using a simple model that attributes the jump in the anisotropy field
to the presence of an effective fourth-order anisotropy constant, responsible
for the discontinuous character of the transition. Remarkably, for in-plane
magnetic fields, we identify a new AFMR mode that persists from 12 K up to
T$_N$. This mode likely corresponds to the dynamics of a long period
incommensurate state, previously detected by resonant elastic X-ray scattering.

Abstract: Multiorbital Hubbard models with Hund coupling and crystal-field splitting
exhibit an instability toward spin-triplet excitonic order in the parameter
regime characterized by strong local spin fluctuations. Upon chemical doping,
two distinct types of excitonic ferromagnetism have been reported. Using
steady-state nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that
photo-doped half-filled systems can host nonthermal counterparts of these
excitonic phases and exhibit a rich phase diagram in the space of photo-doping
and crystal field splitting. Photo-doping a spin-triplet excitonic insulator
provides a route towards nonequilibrium control of magnetic order.

Abstract: Single crystals of $R$Rh$_6$Ge$_4$ ($R$ = Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd - Er) were
synthesized using a Bi flux and their physical properties were characterized by
magnetization, resistivity, and specific heat measurements. These compounds
crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric LiCo$_6$P$_4$-type structure (space group
$P\bar{6}m2$), where rare-earth atoms form a triangular lattice in the
$ab$-plane and chains along the $c$-axis. PrRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and ErRh$_6$Ge$_4$ do
not exhibit magnetic transitions above 0.4 K. NdRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and SmRh$_6$Ge$_4$
are ferromagnets, while GdRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and DyRh$_6$Ge$_4$ show
antiferromagnetic transitions, \red{whereas HoRh$_6$Ge$_4$ is a ferrimagnet}.
In addition, DyRh$_6$Ge$_4$ shows multiple transitions and magnetization
plateaus when a magnetic field is applied along the $c$-axis. In
SmRh$_6$Ge$_4$, like the Ce counterpart, the crystalline-electric field (CEF)
effect leads to an easy plane anisotropy, while in other compounds it gives
rise to a pronounced uniaxial anisotropy.
