TL;DR: Study shows tunable magnon-photon coupling in CrCl3 with magnetic field, revealing spin-flop transitions and low-loss spin wave modes for hybrid devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of magnetic reorientation of spins in CrCl3 on cavity-magnon-polariton interaction strength, which remains largely unexplored despite its potential for fast information transfer and reduced dissipation.

Method: The researchers analyzed the interaction between magnons in CrCl3 and photons in a coplanar waveguide resonator, focusing on how the coupling strength changes with the magnetic field.

Result: The magnon-photon coupling strength varies nonmonotonically with the magnetic field, and spin-flop transition signatures are observed. Standing spin wave modes with nonzero momentum show potential as low-loss propagation channels.

Conclusion: The study investigates the coupling between magnons in CrCl3 and cavity photons, revealing a nonmonotonic and distinct variation in coupling strength with magnetic field for both acoustic and optical magnons. It also identifies spin-flop transition signatures and low-loss propagation channels from standing spin wave modes.

Abstract: Cavity-magnon-polaritons are hybrid excitations from the interaction between cavity photons and magnons, the quanta of collective spin oscillations. Along with the tunability of the magnon-photon coupling strength, fast information transfer and conversion speed are desired in hybrid devices. This can be achieved utilizing the propagating nature of spin waves with non-zero momentum for their ultra-fast time dynamics and reduced ohmic dissipation. Antiferromagnets are particularly interesting as hosts for magnons since stray-field interactions are minimized, and they support multiple modes with distinctive magnetic-field behavior across the phase diagram. CrCl3 is a van der Waals antiferromagnet having a strong easy-plane anisotropy and a weak in-plane easy-axis anisotropy. Despite some magnetic resonance studies, the impact of magnetic reorientation of spins in CrCl3 on cavity-magnon-polariton interaction strength as a function of magnetic field remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the coupling between magnons in CrCl3 and photons in a coplanar waveguide resonator as a function of magnetic field. In particular, we find that the magnon-photon coupling strength varies nonmonotonically and distinctly with the magnetic field for both acoustic and optical magnons, enabling tuning of the coupling strength with an external magnetic field as a knob. We find the signature of spin-flop transition in two harmonics of the cavity due to a stronger dispersive coupling between optical magnons and cavity photons at lower fields. Additionally, we find standing modes formed by spin waves with nonzero momentum associated with the two hybrid magnons when the external field is applied at an angle with the crystal plane. These modes do not undergo substantial coupling with the cavity mode unlike the antiferromagnetic modes and can be used as low-loss propagation channels in hybrid devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InSb's narrow bandgap and high quantum efficiency make it ideal for infrared detectors, but further enhancement in absorption is needed for multi-color applications.

Method: A plasmonic structure is proposed to enhance infrared absorption in ultrathin InSb films.

Result: The plasmonic structure effectively enhances infrared absorption in InSb films, enabling potential for multi-color detection.

Conclusion: The proposed plasmonic structure significantly enhances infrared absorption in ultrathin InSb films, providing a foundation for highly sensitive multi-color detectors.

Abstract: Indium antimonide (InSb) is a fundamental material for infrared radiation detectors based on interband transitions. Its narrow bandgap enables detection of infrared radiation within the $3-5 μm$ atmospheric window, while its high quantum efficiency ensures excellent sensitivity in InSb-based detectors. We propose a plasmonic structure that significantly enhances infrared absorption in an ultrathin InSb film. The resonant characteristics of this plasmonic enhancement effect could serve as a foundation for developing highly sensitive multi-color detectors.

*Wenhao Li,Junyao Wu,Ning Han,Rui Zhao,Fujia Chen,Yuang Pan,Yudong Ren,Hongsheng Chen,Zhen Gao,Ce Shang,Yihao Yang*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: First experimental observation of custodial chiral symmetry in a memristive SSH circuit, confirming its role in protecting topological edge states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and experimentally observe custodial symmetry, a residual symmetry important in high-energy physics, in a classical analog system.

Method: The authors conducted experiments on a memristive SSH circuit, measuring the correction to the Lagrangian and observing the behavior of topological edge states.

Result: Direct experimental evidence for custodial symmetry was provided, showing the vanishing of Lagrangian corrections as perturbations were reduced, and the protection of topological edge states by the symmetry.

Conclusion: This work successfully demonstrates the first experimental observation of a classical analog of custodial chiral symmetry in a memristive SSH circuit, opening new avenues for studying field-theoretic symmetries in such platforms.

Abstract: The concept of custodial symmetry, a residual symmetry that protects physical observables from large quantum corrections, has been a cornerstone of high-energy physics, but its experimental observation has remained unexplored. Building on recent theoretical work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 097701 (2022)], we report the first experimental observation of classical analog of custodial chiral symmetry in a memristive Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit. We provide direct experimental evidence for custodial symmetry through the measurement of the correction to the Lagrangian. This Lagrangian correction, which mimics a mass term in field theory, vanishes smoothly as the perturbation is reduced. We also demonstrate that topological edge states in the memristive SSH circuit remain localized at the boundary, protected by custodial chiral symmetry. This work opens new avenues for emulating field-theoretic symmetries and nonlinear dynamics in memristive platforms.

TL;DR: This paper explores low-voltage operation of PeLEDs, analyzing data to optimize EQE and ECE at sub-bandgap voltages for high radiance and minimal power consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High radiance with minimal power consumption is desired for PeLEDs, but current performance metrics (EQE and ECE) peak at high biases with significant power consumption.

Method: The researchers analyzed scattered experimental data from literature to explore the possibility of achieving maximum EQE and ECE at sub-bandgap voltages.

Result: The analysis reveals the potential for optimizing PeLED performance at low voltages, achieving high radiance under sub-bandgap conditions.

Conclusion: The study successfully identifies the limits for low voltage operation of PeLEDs and provides optimization routes for achieving high radiance at sub-bandgap voltages.

Abstract: Ultra low voltage operation of Perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has been demonstrated in recent years as high radiance with minimal power consumption is a desired feature. However, the light output at such conditions from PeLEDs is typically very low, and the maximum in external quantum efficiency (EQE) and energy conversion efficiency (ECE) are achieved at large biases with significant power consumption. Here, we explore the possibility of achieving maximums in EQE and ECE at sub band gap voltages for PeLEDs. Our analysis consistently interprets otherwise scattered experimental data from literature, identifies the limits for low voltage operation, and elucidates optimization routes for sub band gap high radiance operation of PeLEDs.

Abstract: Quantum geometry is a differential geometry based on quantum mechanics. It is related to various transport and optical properties in condensed matter physics. The Zeeman quantum geometry is a generalization of quantum geometry including the spin degrees of freedom. It is related to electromagnetic cross responses. Quantum geometry is generalized to non-Hermitian systems and density matrices. Especially, the latter is quantum information geometry, where the quantum Fisher information naturally arises as quantum metric.

### [6] [Toward a Theoretical Roadmap for Organic Memristive Materials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05617)
*Salvador Cardona-Serra*

TL;DR: A computational framework is proposed to guide the design of organic memristors for neuromorphic systems, exploring ionic migration, redox switching, and chiral conduction as key mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a theoretical framework for understanding how molecular structure translates into memristive function in organic systems, with the goal of advancing neuromorphic computing.

Method: The study employs a multiscale computational perspective, integrating quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, and other approaches to analyze and design organic memristors.

Result: Identifies three mechanisms—ionic migration, redox-driven switching, and conduction interplay in chiral molecules—as promising routes for developing next-generation organic memristors.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a multiscale computational framework to guide the design of organic memristors for neuromorphic computing, discussing ionic migration, redox-driven switching, and conduction interplay in chiral molecules as key mechanisms. It highlights the potential of theoretically guided approaches to accelerate advancements in chemically engineered synaptic materials.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aspires to overcome the intrinsic inefficiencies of von Neumann architectures by co-locating memory and computation in physical devices that emulate biological neurons and synapses. Memristive materials stand at the core of this paradigm, enabling non-volatile, history-dependent electronic responses. While inorganic oxides currently dominate the field, molecular and polymeric systems can offer untapped advantages in terms of chemical tunability, structural flexibility, low-cost processing, and biocompatibility. However, progress has been hindered by the absence of a theoretical framework able to rationalize how molecular structure translates into memristive function. Here, a multiscale computational perspective is presented, outlining how quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics, among other approaches, can be integrated into a coherent methodology to design next-generation organic memristors. Three mechanisms, ionic migration, redox-driven switching, and conduction interplay in chiral molecules are examined as representative routes toward molecular neuromorphic hardware. The opportunities and challenges associated with each mechanism are discussed, together with a view on how a theoretically guided roadmap can accelerate the emergence of chemically engineered synaptic materials.

### [7] [Excitation of quasiparticle pairs in superconducting nanodevices by 1/f noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05644)
*Clare C. Yu,M. C. Goffage,Yifan Wang,A. Alase,M. C. Cassidy,S. N. Coppersmith*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Study links high-frequency 1/f noise to quasiparticle excitation in superconducting devices, proposing new experiments to analyze noise and defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origins of nonequilibrium quasiparticles in superconducting nanodevices, which cause decoherence and energy loss, despite shielding from background radiation.

Method: Analysis of high-frequency 1/f noise and its impact on quasiparticles in superconducting nanodevices, supported by experimental data.

Result: High-frequency 1/f noise is identified as a source of quasiparticle excitation, consistent with experimental observations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that high-frequency components of 1/f noise can excite quasiparticle pairs, explaining previously unexplained experimental results, and proposes new experiments to characterize noise and defects non-invasively.

Abstract: Superconducting nanodevices such as qubits, resonators, and photodetectors, have revolutionized our capabilities for probing and controlling quantum phenomena. Nonequilibrium quasiparticles, which are broken Cooper pairs that cause decoherence and energy loss, can limit their performance. The number of these quasiparticles is often tens of orders of magnitude greater than would be present in thermal equilibrium. Background radiation has been shown to excite quasiparticles, but quasiparticles are observed even when the devices are carefully shielded. Here we show that the high-frequency components of 1/f noise can excite quasiparticle pairs and that this mechanism is consistent with previously unexplained experimental results. We also propose new experiments that exploit this quasiparticle excitation mechanism to non-invasively characterize high-frequency charge noise as well as the locations and nature of the defects producing the noise. The proposed experiments would also investigate how this noise changes as the defects that give rise to it evolve towards thermal equilibrium.

*Alessandro Veneri,Francesco Quintavalle,Thierry Valet,Roberto Raimondi*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Investigating Rashba SOC under $C_{2v}$ and $C_{3v}$ symmetries reveals anisotropic effects and the importance of vertex corrections for spin-charge interconversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the effects of lowering in-plane rotational symmetry to $C_{2v}$ and $C_{3v}$ on the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and spin-charge interconversion.

Method: The research employs microscopic theory, including disorder and vertex corrections, using both the diagrammatic implementation of the Kubo formula and quantum kinetic theory.

Result: In the $C_{2v}$ case, the spin density deviates notably from the standard 90-degree rotation. In the $C_{3v}$ case, spin-charge interconversion depends on the warping intensity. Vertex corrections are shown to be critical for accurate results.

Conclusion: The study concludes that lowering the in-plane rotational symmetry to $C_{2v}$ and $C_{3v}$ groups significantly affects the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, leading to anisotropic electron spectra and deviations from the standard 90-degree rotation in spin density. Vertex corrections are highlighted as essential for accurately capturing the inverse spin galvanic effect.

Abstract: The Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is a well-known mechanism for the spin-charge interconversion via the inverse and direct spin galvanic effects. The lack of a full inversion symmetry allows the coupling of the charge current and spin density. In this paper we investigate this phenomenon when the in-plane rotational symmetry is lowered to the $C_{2v}$ and $C_{3v}$ symmetry groups, whereby the electron spectrum becomes anisotropic. We find that in the $C_{2v}$ case, depending on the ratio between the Rashba SOC strengths along the principal axes, the non-equilibrium spin density deviates notably from the $90^o$ degrees rotation, with respect to the applied electric field, familiar in the isotropic case. In the $C_{3v}$ case, when a warping cubic-in-momentum term is present, whereas the standard $90^o$ degrees rotation of the spin density remains, the spin-charge interconversion depends on the intensity of the warping itself. The microscopic theory takes into account disorder including vertex corrections, both via the diagrammatic implementation of the Kubo formula and via the quantum kinetic theory. We show that vertex corrections are crucial to capture the details of the inverse spin galvanic effect in contrast to previous treatments based on the constant broadening approximation.

TL;DR: Theoretical study shows weak quantum fluctuations in a non-symmetric environment can cause quantized transconductance, potentially enabling Quantum Hall-like effects without typical conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the possibility of realizing quantized transconductance and Quantum Hall phenomenology without conventional requirements like strong magnetic fields or topological states.

Method: Theoretical analysis of quantum fluctuations in a multi-terminal quantum contact under a non-symmetric electromagnetic environment.

Result: Weak quantum fluctuations can lead to quantized transconductance in a multi-terminal quantum contact, challenging traditional assumptions about Quantum Hall effects.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that weak quantum fluctuations in a non-symmetric electromagnetic environment can induce quantized transconductance, suggesting a novel pathway to achieve Quantum Hall-like behavior without traditional prerequisites.

Abstract: We show theoretically that weak quantum fluctuations induced by a non-symmetric electromagnetic environment may lead to a quantized transconductance of a multi-terminal quantum contact rather than to a blockade of transport in the contact. The result suggests the possibility to realize Quantum Hall phenomenology without its common ingredients and/or a topological quantum state.

### [10] [Boltzmann transport theory of magnon-exciton drag](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05835)
*Zakhar A. Iakovlev,Akashdeep Kamra,Mikhail M. Glazov1*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag in CrSBr shows efficient coupling and fast scattering, enabling enhanced exciton propagation in magnetic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and model the magnon-exciton drag effect in CrSBr for controlling exciton propagation.

Method: We develop a microscopic theory, derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, and solve the Boltzmann kinetic equation.

Result: Effective exciton-magnon coupling leads to highly efficient two-magnon processes and sub-ps scattering time, enabling large and isotropic exciton propagation.

Conclusion: Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems.

Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag effect in a bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors critically affect current flow and coherence, imposing limits on superconducting quantum technologies. Understanding vortex entry, motion, and pinning at micro- and mesoscopic scales is essential for device performance.

Method: The researchers used cavity-optomechanical platforms combining flux-tunable microwave resonators with superconducting nanomechanical elements to investigate vortex entry processes at the single-event level.

Result: Discrete jumps in mechanical resonance frequency were observed due to individual vortex entry, corresponding to attonewton-scale forces and enabling extraction of single-vortex pinning energies. These signatures were superimposed on a smooth power-law background.

Conclusion: The study establishes optomechanics-inspired sensing as a powerful method for exploring fundamental superconducting properties and identifying decoherence pathways in quantum circuits. It also opens new opportunities for integrating mechanical sensing into superconducting device architectures.

Abstract: Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors critically influence current flow and coherence, thereby imposing fundamental limits on superconducting quantum technologies. Quantum circuits employ superconducting elements at micro- and mesoscopic scales, where individual vortices can significantly impact device performance, necessitating investigation of vortex entry, motion, and pinning in these constrained geometries. Cavity-optomechanical platforms combining flux-tunable microwave resonators with superconducting nanomechanical elements offer a promising route to the single-photon strong-coupling regime and enable highly sensitive probing of the mechanical degree of freedom under elevated magnetic fields. Here, we exploit this platform to investigate vortex entry processes at the single-event level. We observe discrete jumps of the mechanical resonance frequency attributable to individual vortex entry, corresponding to attonewton-scale forces and allowing quantitative extraction of single-vortex pinning energies. These signatures are superimposed on a smooth power-law background characteristic of the collective Campbell-regime of vortex elasticity. Our results establish optomechanics-inspired sensing as a powerful method for exploring fundamental superconducting properties and identifying decoherence pathways in quantum circuits. Beyond advancing vortex physics, this work opens new opportunities for integrating mechanical sensing into superconducting device architectures, bridging condensed matter physics and quantum information science.

### [12] [Interaction-Induced Breakdown of Anderson Localization: Thermodynamic Segregation disguised as the Skin Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05393)
*Ali Tozar*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Strong repulsive interactions in the Fermi-Hubbard model can counteract disorder-induced localization, leading to boundary segregation, distinct from the NHSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the counter-intuitive breakdown of the paradigm where strong disorder and interactions typically localize states, focusing on the interplay between disorder and repulsive interactions.

Method: The research investigates the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model under open boundary conditions, utilizing rigorous control experiments in the Hermitian limit.

Result: Strong repulsive interactions can overcome disorder-induced localization, resulting in a macroscopically segregated phase with spin species accumulating at opposite boundaries. This phenomenon is distinct from the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect.

Conclusion: The study challenges the conventional understanding of disorder-interaction competition by demonstrating that strong repulsive interactions can overcome disorder-induced localization, leading to a macroscopically segregated phase. The interaction-induced segregation is a sharp thermodynamic crossover driven by many-body energy minimization.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between strong disorder and repulsive interactions in the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model under open boundary conditions. While uncorrelated disorder is widely accepted to localize all single-particle eigenstates, a phenomenon typically reinforced by interactions in the Many-Body Localization (MBL) regime, we report a counter-intuitive breakdown of this paradigm. We demonstrate that strong repulsive interactions can overcome disorder-induced localization, driving the system into a macroscopically segregated phase where spin species accumulate at opposite boundaries. Although this boundary accumulation phenomenologically mimics the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect (NHSE) observed in non-reciprocal systems, our comprehensive analysis reveals a fundamentally different origin. By performing a rigorous control experiment in the Hermitian limit, we prove that the segregation persists without non-reciprocity, identifying many-body energy minimization as the primary driver. This "interaction-induced segregation" manifests as a sharp thermodynamic crossover, characterized by a divergent energy susceptibility, challenging the conventional understanding of disorder-interaction competition in open quantum systems.

TL;DR: Rare-earth borates, especially Ba$_3$XB$_9$O$_{18}$ and Ba$_3$XB$_3$O$_9$ (X = Yb, Gd), show promise for ADR below 1 K due to stability and high entropy, addressing helium-3 scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the increasing scarcity of helium-3, there is a growing need for alternative refrigeration methods for temperatures below 1 K. The study explores rare-earth oxides as a viable option due to their higher entropy densities and stability under extreme conditions.

Method: The researchers investigated the structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of rare-earth borates Ba$_3$XB$_9$O$_{18}$ and Ba$_3$XB$_3$O$_9$ (X = Yb, Gd) through experimental measurements. The ADR performance was analyzed starting at 2 K under a 5 T magnetic field and compared to existing literature.

Result: The rare-earth borates Ba$_3$XB$_9$O$_{18}$ and Ba$_3$XB$_3$O$_9$ (X = Yb, Gd) exhibited paramagnetic behavior at low temperatures, except for Ba$_3$GdB$_9$O$_{18}$, which ordered at 108 mK. The ADR performance analysis demonstrated their potential as effective refrigerants under practical conditions.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of rare-earth borates, particularly Ba$_3$XB$_9$O$_{18}$ and Ba$_3$XB$_3$O$_9$ (X = Yb, Gd), as promising materials for adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) at temperatures below 1 K. The findings suggest practical advantages over traditional paramagnetic hydrated salts due to their stability and higher entropy densities.

Abstract: Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR) is regaining relevance for the refrigeration to temperatures below 1 K as global helium-3 supply is increasingly strained. While ADR at these temperatures is long established with paramagnetic hydrated salts, more recently frustrated rare-earth oxides were found to offer higher entropy densities and practical advantages since they do not degrade under heating or evacuation. We report structural, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the rare-earth borates Ba$_3$XB$_9$O$_{18}$ and Ba$_3$XB$_3$O$_9$ with X = (Yb, Gd). Except for Ba$_3$GdB$_9$O$_{18}$, which orders at 108 mK, the three other materials remain paramagnetic down to their lowest measured temperatures. ADR performance starting at 2 K in a field of 5 T is analyzed and compared to literature results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the contested magnetic structure of Cr1+δTe2 and understand the role of structural vacancies in determining its spin configuration.

Method: Combined single-crystal neutron diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations to investigate the magnetic structure and vacancy effects in Cr1.33Te2.

Result: Neutron diffraction confirmed a collinear spin alignment, while spectroscopic and computational analyses revealed that structural vacancies break local symmetry, modifying the orbital degeneracy of Cr 3d states and stabilizing the collinear magnetic state.

Conclusion: The collinear magnetic ground state in Cr1+δTe2 is stabilized by structural vacancies, which modify the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, offering a pathway to control spin anisotropy and magnetic ordering in layered ferromagnets.

Abstract: Cr$_{1+δ}$Te$_2$, a two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet, displays a contested magnetic structure, poised between collinear and non-collinear spin configurations. In this work, we investigate the magnetic structure of Cr$_{1.33}$Te$_2$ at the microscopic level by combining single-crystal neutron diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations. Neutron diffraction measurements reveal a distinct collinear spin alignment, whereas spectroscopic analyses reveal inherent structural vacancies at both Cr and Te sites. These vacancies lead to local symmetry breaking that elevates the orbital degeneracy of the Cr 3$d$ states, as demonstrated by our first-principles analysis. The resulting modification of magnetocrystalline anisotropy emerges as the key mechanism stabilising the collinear magnetic ground state over the non-collinear one in the presence of vacancies. Our findings uncover a vacancy-driven route to control spin anisotropy and magnetic ordering in layered ferromagnets, offering new insights into the design of tunable 2D magnetic materials.

Its low-energy excitations, the phason, are collective, gapless phase fluctuations. We study a half-filled, four-band ladder model where a shift $δ=p/q$ between the legs leads to a supercell of q composite cells. The moiré potential narrows minibands near the Fermi level, resulting in additional peaks in the density of states, whose separation is controlled by $δ$. The inclusion of short-range Coulomb interactions leads to an excitonic incommensurate CDW state. We identify the oscillations in its amplitude with a gapped Higgs collective mode and a lowest-energy Goldstone mode, realized by long-lived neutral phasons whose propagation velocity is governed by the shift δ and the inter-leg tunneling amplitude. Our results show that even the slightest interlayer mismatches can strongly modify both charge-ordering patterns and low-energy bosonic excitations in layered materials, and suggest that the enigmatic CDW phase in the quasi-one-dimensional compound HfTe3 is excitonic in nature.

Abstract: The discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has opened the door to a new route to high temperature superconductivity, distinct from that in cuprates and iron-based materials. Yet, despite intense recent activity, we lack experimentally testable protocols for distinguishing between different pairing scenarios. In this Letter, we construct a minimal two-band model that reproduces the Fermi-surface topology observed in recent ARPES measurements and DFT calculations, and we analyze superconductivity arising from two distinct pairing mechanisms. We show that these mechanisms yield sharply different responses to an applied perpendicular electric field. Thus, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ offers the unique opportunity to cleanly distinguish between different pairing scenarios. Finally, we propose three concrete experimental proposals designed to distinguish these scenarios and thereby identify the pairing mechanism most relevant to the real material.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the mechanism behind the onset of incommensurate charge order in layered materials.

Method: A half-filled, four-band tight-binding model on a ladder with a relative shift $δ=p/q$ between the legs is studied, including Coulomb interactions to analyze the incommensurate charge-density-wave phase.

Result: An incommensurate charge-density-wave phase with out-of-phase charge modulation between the legs is found, characterized by long-lived neutral, acoustic phasons.

Conclusion: This model highlights the impact of interlayer incongruities on the formation of excitonic charge-ordered phases in van der Waals and heterostructured materials, providing insights into the role of moiré potentials and inter-leg tunneling in such systems.

Abstract: An incommensurate charge density wave is a periodic modulation of charge that breaks translational symmetry at a momentum that does not coincide with the primitive lattice vectors. Its Goldstone excitation, the phason, comprises collective gapless phase fluctuations. Aiming to unveil the mechanism behind the onset of incommensurate charge order in layered materials, we study a half-filled, four-band tight-binding model on a ladder with a relative shift $δ=p/q$ between the legs, induced by the dimerization of one of them. The shift results in a moiré supercell comprising q composite cells and a modulated inter-leg tunneling. The moiré potential compresses the leg bands into flat minibands near the Fermi level, resulting in additional low-energy peaks in the density of states. Including Coulomb interactions, we find an incommensurate charge-density-wave phase in which the charge modulation is out of phase between the legs. The collective excitations of this state are long-lived neutral, acoustic phasons whose speed is controlled by the moiré parameter $δ$ and the inter-leg tunneling amplitude. This model sheds light on the role of interlayer incongruities in the formation of excitonic charge-ordered phases in van der Waals and heterostructured materials.

Result: Identified a regime of structural irreversibility and thermal memory effects, confirming the coupling between lattice distortions and electronic degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: The study advances the understanding of metastability and memory phenomena in strongly correlated materials, opening pathways for adaptive and neuromorphic functionalities in quantum materials.

Abstract: Phase separated manganites provide a unique platform to study the dynamics of competing electronic and structural orders in correlated systems. In $La_{0.275}Pr_{0.35}Ca_{0.375}MnO_{3}$ (LPCMO), we use temperature cycling Raman spectroscopy to uncover a previously unidentified regime of structural irreversibility, emerging from the interplay between lattice distortions and phase competition across the phase separation and charge and orbital ordering temperatures. This irreversible behavior encodes a thermal memory effect reflecting the system's history dependent energy landscape. Correlated magnetic and transport responses confirm the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom, revealing a nem form of nonequilibrium phase dynamics in mixed valence oxides. These results advance the understanding of metastability and memory phenomena in strongly correlated materials, opening pathways toward adaptive and neuromorphic functionalities in quantum materials.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to demonstrate the topological contribution to the magnetoelectric polarizability in 2D antiferromagnets, linking it to the electromagnetic response of topological semimetals in two dimensions.

Method: The authors compute the magnetoelectric polarizability microscopically using two minimal lattice models: a spin-orbit coupled Néel antiferromagnet and a spin-orbit-free noncollinear antiferromagnet with double-Q spin order.

Result: The results reveal that the topological origin of the magnetoelectric effect can be traced to a strong topological invariant in one dimension, with nontrivial crystalline topology signatures in 1D lattice models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the magnetoelectric response in 2D antiferromagnets is determined by the topology of the ground state, with potential applications in material realizations.

Abstract: In this paper we predict that the magnetoelectric response of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets is determined by the topology of the ground state. This topological magnetoelectric response, encoded in the spin magnetoelectric polarizability and its closely related spin multipolization, occurs when the electronic structure of the antiferromagnetic insulator is described by massive 2D Dirac fermions, and is therefore native to 2D, unlike the topological magnetoelectric effect of three-dimensional topological insulators. To demonstrate the topological contribution to the (spin) magnetoelectric polarizability, we compute the magnetoelectric polarizability microscopically for two distinct minimal lattice models: a spin-orbit coupled Néel antiferromagnet and a spin-orbit-free noncollinear antiferromagnet with double-$Q$ spin order. We show that the topological origin of the revealed magnetoelectric effect can be traced back to the electromagnetic response of topological semimetals in two dimensions, and hence is ultimately governed by a strong topological invariant in one dimension. Given this dimensional hierarchy, we further consider two minimal lattice models in one dimension, both one-dimensional variants of the 2D lattice models, and show that the magnetoelectric polarizability exhibits a clear signature of nontrivial crystalline topology. Possible material realizations are discussed.

Result: The layer dipole magnetoelectric polarizability exhibits a (quasi-)topological contribution in the buckled square lattice model, indicating a topological magnetoelectric response in 2D antiferromagnets.

Conclusion: The study identifies a topological magnetoelectric response in two-dimensional antiferromagnets linked to the layer pseudospin degree of freedom.

Abstract: In this paper we study magnetoelectric effects in two-dimensional magnetic bilayers and introduce the notion of a layer dipole magnetoelectric polarizability. This magnetoelectric polarizability describes the magnetization response to an applied electric field perpendicular to the bilayer. As such, it represents the electric analog of the spin magnetoelectric polarizability, governing the charge polarization response to an applied Zeeman field. Starting from the orbital magnetization produced by a perpendicular displacement field, we derive a microscopic expression for the layer dipole magnetoelectric polarizability and apply it to two minimal models for bilayer magnets, i.e., a buckled square lattice model and a magnetic topological insulator model. In the case of the buckled square lattice model we show that the layer dipole magnetoelectric polarizability has a (quasi-)topological contribution, revealing a topological magnetoelectric response of two-dimensional antiferromagnets associated with the layer pseudospin degree of freedom.

Abstract: BaMg2Bi2 is a Dirac semimetal characterized by a simple Dirac cone crossing the Fermi level at the center of the Brillouin zone, protected by C3 rotational symmetry. Together with its Sr-based analogue SrMg2Bi2, it has been proposed as a promising candidate for a chemically driven topological switch: while SrMg2Bi2 is an insulator, BaMg2Bi2 exhibits non-trivial topological features. A detailed understanding of its electronic structure is essential to elucidate its electronic and transport properties. Previous photoemission studies confirmed the Dirac nature of BaMg2Bi2, but were limited to high photon energies, which hindered direct comparison with density functional theory calculations (DFT), due to reduced resolution and higher-frequency matrix-element modulation in that regime. In this work, we combine high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT calculations to get full insight on the valence band states, providing a comprehensive picture of the low-energy electronic structure. Our measurements reveal the presence of previously unobserved surface states. We found that they are topologically trivial, but they unlock a more comprehensive understanding of the material's behavior, reconciling previous discrepancies between experiment and theory.

Motivation: To clarify whether the vanishing of heat capacities at $T\to0^+$ introduces new thermodynamic laws or aligns with existing stability criteria.

Method: Examining the relationship between the vanishing of heat capacities and thermal stability, focusing on states at the phase space boundary and comparing with marginal Fermi liquids.

Result: Heat capacities vanishing as fast as or faster than $T$ sustain thermal stability, while weakly vanishing capacities indicate a critical condition at $T=0$.

Conclusion: The vanishing of the heat capacities as $T\to0^+$ is a confirmatory result of the existing thermodynamic framework and not a new law.

Abstract: The relationship between the vanishing of the heat capacities as $T\to0^+$ and the thermal stability is examined. The heat capacities vanish as fast as or faster than $T$ as $T\to0^+$ for states at the phase space boundary ($T=0$) to sustain the standard thermal stability criterion $U_{ss}>0$. Conversely, weakly vanishing heat capacities, which signify a loss of curvature in $U(S)$ at $T=0$, are the signature of a critical condition precisely at $T=0$, as exemplified in marginal Fermi liquids. Therefore, the vanishing of the specific heat should be viewed not as a new law but as a confirmatory result of the existing framework of thermodynamics.

TL;DR: Asymmetry in bistable system potentials can control dynamic hysteresis and symmetry breaking, offering new technological applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how asymmetry in the potential of bistable systems can control dynamic hysteresis and symmetry breaking under periodic fields and noise, with applications in technology.

Method: The research investigates dynamic hysteresis in bistable systems under periodic fields and noise. It analyzes hysteresis loops and symmetry breaking, using an order parameter to quantify transitions. The study also examines the effect of potential asymmetry on hysteresis loop area and order parameter.

Result: The study finds that asymmetry in the potential can induce symmetry breaking in hysteresis loops even under moderate conditions. It quantitatively relates hysteresis loop area and order parameter to the degree of potential asymmetry.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that introducing asymmetry in the underlying potential can induce symmetry breaking in hysteresis loops under moderate conditions, providing a new method to control dynamic hysteresis for technological applications.

Abstract: The influence of an external periodic field in a bistable system gives rise to a very interesting phenomenon of dynamic hysteresis, which has extensive applications in technologies. Environmental noise also has a crucial role in controlling this class of hysteresis. The relaxational delay of the system's response towards the periodic drive manifests in the response function-field hysteresis loops. These hysteresis loops are generally symmetric in the range of the external force and the response function. Symmetry breaking is observed under extreme conditions of the noise strength, amplitude and frequency of the periodic force. This symmetric-asymmetric dynamic transition is interpreted in terms of the relevant order parameter defined for the system under study. In our present work, we importantly identify that it is possible to induce symmetry breaking in the hysteresis loops, and consequently to observe dynamic transitions under moderate conditions as well if appropriate asymmetry is implemented in the design of the underlying potential. We develop a quantitative understanding of the variation of the hysteresis loop area and the order parameter with respect to the degree of asymmetry in the potential. Our study suggests an ingenious way to get the desired outputs in the processes related to dynamic hysteresis by effectively controlling the asymmetry of the intrinsic potential governing the dynamics. These findings not only direct a new and impactful path for technological advances involving hysteresis but also provide the basic understanding of the precise role of the underlying potential in regulating this fundamental process, which manifests frequently in natural and designed systems.

Conclusion: 论文为蛋白质动力学转变提供了一个统一的非平衡解释，认为这种现象可以视为一个更普遍的交叉机制的实例。

Abstract: A dynamical transition -- seen as a sudden increase in the mean-squared displacement at a characteristic temperature that depends on the observation time -- is widely reported in neutron-scattering experiments and molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated proteins. However, its physical origin remains elusive. We show that fluctuating diffusivity in a Langevin framework leads to an observation-time-induced crossover, where the effective diffusion coefficient exhibits a temperature-dependent transition whose crossover point shifts with observation time. Analytical and numerical analyses reveal the mechanism of this crossover and delineate the conditions under which it emerges. Our findings provide a unified nonequilibrium interpretation for observation-time-induced crossover, and suggest that the protein dynamical transition can be viewed as an instance of this general crossover mechanism.

Motivation: To investigate mixed eigenstates and the contribution of dynamical tunneling in systems with sharply-divided phase space, generalizing predictions for hierarchical states in KAM systems.

Method: Analysis of mixed eigenstates using piecewise-linear maps with regular-chaotic boundaries formed by MUPOs or quasi-periodic orbits, employing the overlap index and entropy localization length.

Result: Dynamical tunneling scales as ∼ℏ exp(-b/ℏ); sticky eigenstates scale as ℏ^(1/2) for MUPO and oscillate around this behavior for quasi-periodic cases.

Conclusion: The study reveals a clear quantum signature of classical stickiness in non-KAM systems through the analysis of mixed eigenstates in piecewise-linear maps, with distinct scaling behaviors for MUPO and quasi-periodic cases.

Abstract: We investigate mixed eigenstates in systems with sharply-divided phase space, using different piecewise-linear maps whose regular-chaotic boundaries are formed by marginally unstable periodic orbits (MUPOs) or by quasi-periodic orbits. With the overlap index and the entropy localization length, we classify mixed eigenstates and show that the contribution from dynamical tunneling scales as $\sim \hbar\, \exp(-b/\hbar)$, with $b>0$ associated with the relative size of the regular region. The dominant fraction of states that remain sticky to the boundaries, referred to as sticky eigenstates, scales as $\hbar^{1/2}$ in the MUPO case and oscillates around this algebraic behavior in the quasi-periodic case. This behavior generalizes established predictions for hierarchical states in KAM systems, which scale as $\hbar^{1 - 1/γ}$, with $γ$ set by the corresponding classical stickiness reflected in the algebraic decay of cumulative RTDs $t^{-γ}$. For the piecewise-linear maps studied here, $γ= 2$. These results reveal a clear quantum signature of classical stickiness in non-KAM systems.

Motivation: To explore the geometric control of population growth in boundary-catalytic branching processes and balance the effects of branching and absorption events.

Method: The study uses a Steklov spectral problem to analyze the phase diagram of the stochastic process and determine the critical line for population growth or extinction.

Result: The principal eigenvalue identifies the critical line between exponential growth and extinction, and a critical catalytic rate is established beyond which control is impossible.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a framework for understanding and controlling boundary-catalytic branching processes, identifying a critical catalytic rate and optimal absorption rate for steady-state behavior.

Abstract: Boundary-catalytic branching processes describe a broad class of natural phenomena where the population of diffusing particles grows due to their spontaneous binary branching (e.g., division, fission or splitting) on a catalytic boundary located in a complex environment. We investigate the possibility of geometric control of the population growth by compensating the proliferation of particles due to branching events by their absorptions in the bulk or on boundary absorbing regions. We identify an appropriate Steklov spectral problem to obtain the phase diagram of this out-of-equilibrium stochastic process. The principal eigenvalue determines the critical line that separates an exponential growth of the population from its extinction. In other words, we establish a powerful tool for calculating the optimal absorption rate that equilibrates the opposite effects of branching and absorption events and thus results in steady-state behavior of this diffusion-reaction system. Moreover, we show the existence of a critical catalytic rate above which no compensation is possible, so that the population cannot be controlled and keeps growing exponentially. The proposed framework opens promising perspectives for better understanding, modeling and control of various boundary-catalytic branching processes, with applications in physics and life sciences.

Motivation: To investigate the effects of high-pressure synthesis on the superconducting properties of SmFeAsO1-xFx, particularly the enhancement of Tc and Jc.

Method: Synthesized SmFeAsO1-xFx samples using an in-situ cubic-anvil high-pressure technique at 4 GPa, characterized via structural, microstructural, Raman, transport, and magnetic measurements.

Result: Enhanced Tc by 10-17 K, increased Jc by up to an order of magnitude, and a maximum Tc of 57 K with Jc of 10^4 A-cm^-2 at optimal doping. Upper critical field reached ~200 T, indicating strong spin paramagnetic effects and multiband superconductivity.

Conclusion: High-pressure synthesis is a highly effective approach for optimizing iron-based superconductors, with potential for both fundamental research and high-field applications.

Abstract: A series of SmFeAsO1-xFx (Sm1111) bulk samples are synthesized using an in-situ cubic-anvil high-pressure (CA-HP) technique at 4 GPa and are characterized through structural, microstructural, Raman, transport, and magnetic measurements. A systematic reduction of lattice parameters and unit-cell volume confirms effective fluorine substitution at oxygen sites, while Raman spectroscopy reveals electron doping and subtle changes in local bonding environments. In the underdoped regime, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is enhanced by 10-17 K and the critical current density (Jc) is increased by up to an order of magnitude. The upper critical field (Hc2), estimated using the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model, reaches ~200 T, indicating strong spin paramagnetic effects and multiband superconductivity. Resistive broadening under applied fields follows Arrhenius behavior, with the activation energy showing a power-law field dependence that decreases rapidly at higher fields, consistent with collective vortex pinning. The superconducting phase diagram constructed from Tc and Jc versus fluorine content reveals a dome-like trend, with a maximum Tc of 57 K and Jc of 10^4 A-cm^-2 at the optimal doped region. A direct comparison with CSP samples demonstrates that high-pressure synthesis simultaneously enhances both Tc and Jc across the entire fluorine-doping range. These findings establish high-pressure growth as a highly effective approach for optimizing iron-based superconductors and underscore its potential for both fundamental research and future high field applications.

Motivation: To explore the mechanisms behind the zero-field superconducting diode effect, specifically the role of trapped magnetic flux in breaking time-reversal symmetry.

Method: Demonstration of a sign-controllable superconducting diode effect in a van der Waals superconductor (trigonal PtBi$_2$) using a poling magnetic field applied prior to measurements.

Result: A sign-controllable superconducting diode effect was observed under zero external magnetic field, with the sign controlled by the poling magnetic field.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the critical role of trapped magnetic flux in generating the zero-field superconducting diode effect and suggests a pathway for achieving this effect without external magnetic fields.

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect is one of the nonreciprocal transport phenomena, where the critical current depends on the current direction. This effect is typically realized in superconductors with broken spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry. To break the time-reversal symmetry, external magnetic fields are commonly used. Here, we demonstrate a sign-controllable superconducting diode effect under zero external magnetic field in a van der Waals superconductor trigonal PtBi$_2$. The sign of the zero-field superconducting diode effect is controlled by the poling magnetic field, that is a large magnetic field applied prior to measurements. This result indicates that trapped magnetic flux are responsible for breaking the time-reversal symmetry. Our findings highlight the crucial role of trapped magnetic flux in generating the superconducting diode effect and provide a general pathway for realizing a zero-field superconducting diode effect.

Conclusion: 量子非谐性在XYB6C6包合物的稳定性和超导性中起着决定性作用。

Abstract: Traditionally, strong quantum anharmonic effects have been considered a characteristic of hydrogen-rich compounds. Here we propose that these effects also play a decisive role in boron-carbon clathrates. The stability and superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of carbon-boron clathrates XYB6C6, whose metal atoms have an average oxidation state of +1.5, have long remained under debate. At this oxidation state, some combinations (e.g., RbSrB6C6) are dynamically stable, whereas others (e.g., RbPbB6C6) are not. Using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation combined with machine learning, we find that the anharmonicity originates primarily from guest metal atoms. For comparison, we find that quantum fluctuations have negligible influence on SrB3C3, but remove the lattice instability of RbPbB6C6. The predicted Tc of RbPbB6C6 (88 K) is nearly twice that of SrB3C3. Moreover, RbPbB6C6 exhibits two-gap superconductivity due to the higher C/B ratio in the density of states at the Fermi level compared to SrB3C3, weakening the sp3 hybridization. These findings demonstrate that quantum anharmonicity crucially governs the stability and superconductivity of XYB6C6 clathrates.

TL;DR: Interlayer superconductivity in van der Waals heterostructures is enhanced near ferroelectric domain walls, with magnetic fields and tunneling significantly affecting spin-singlet and spin-triplet states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the distinctive features of superconductivity and ferroelectricity interactions in van der Waals heterostructures, particularly focusing on how ferroelectric domain walls and external magnetic fields influence superconducting properties.

Method: The analysis is conducted using the quasiclassical Eilenberger equations for a tunnel-coupled bilayer with inhomogeneous band shifts, simulating charge transfer in sliding ferroelectrics. The effects of tunneling amplitude and in-plane magnetic fields are systematically studied.

Result: Critical temperature enhancement near ferroelectric domain walls, tunneling amplitude effects on spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductivity, and magnetic field-induced behaviors including reentrant phases and nonmonotonic critical temperature trends were observed.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the interplay between interlayer superconductivity and ferroelectricity in van der Waals heterostructures can enhance the critical temperature of superconductivity near ferroelectric domain walls. The effects of tunneling amplitude, in-plane magnetic fields, and the combined influence of orbital and paramagnetic mechanisms significantly impact the spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductivity, leading to nonmonotonic behaviors and reentrant phases.

Abstract: We study the distinctive features of the interplay between the interlayer superconductivity and ferroelectricity in van der Waals heterostructures. Corresponding analysis is carried out within the framework of the quasiclassical Eilenberger equations for a tunnel coupled bilayer with inhomogeneous relative shift of the conduction bands between the layers, which describes the net charge transfer in sliding ferroelectrics. It is shown that the critical temperature of the interlayer superconductivity can be significantly enhanced for superconducting nuclei localized in the vicinity of ferroelectric domain walls. We demonstrate that the increase in the tunneling amplitude leads to the decrease (increase) in the difference between the critical temperatures for localized and homogeneous superconducting states for the spin-singlet (spin-triplet) interlayer superconductivity. We also perform an extensive analysis of the effects of the in-plane magnetic field on the interlayer superconductivity. It is shown that the orbital effect can result in the suppression of the spin-singlet interlayer superconductivity and to the enhancement of the spin-triplet one. We find that possible manifestations of the paramagnetic effect include the suppression of the interlayer superconductivity by rather weak Zeeman fields, the two-fold anisotropy of the critical magnetic field for the spin-triplet states as well as the appearance of the reentrant superconducting phases. It is shown that the joint influence of the orbital and paramagnetic mechanisms on the spin-triplet interlayer superconductivity can even lead to a nonmonotonic behavior of the superconducting critical temperature as a function of the external magnetic field. The obtained results are discussed in the context of recent experimental data on van der Waals structures with coexisting superconductivity and sliding ferroelectricity.

Motivation: 针对传统监督学习的局限性，探索强化学习及其量子变体（量子强化学习）的潜力，特别是在PQCs的背景下，缺乏对表达能力和可训练性的清晰研究。

Method: 通过定义适合强化学习的表达能力概念，并利用动作分布与奖励信号分布之间的互信息来量化表达能力和可训练性。

Conclusion: 本研究为强化学习中参数化量子电路（PQCs）的选择提供了基于互信息的便捷标准，并在黑盒环境中间接评估学习进展，具有重要价值。

Abstract: In recent years, various limitations of conventional supervised learning have been highlighted, leading to the emergence of reinforcement learning -- and, further, quantum reinforcement learning that exploits quantum resources such as entanglement and superposition -- as promising alternatives. Among the various reinforcement learning methodologies, gradient-based approaches, particularly policy gradient methods, are considered to have many benefits. Moreover, in the quantum regime, they also have a profit in that they can be readily implemented through parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). From the perspective of learning, two indicators can be regarded as most crucial: expressivity and, for gradient-based methods, trainability. While a number of attempts have been made to quantify the expressivity and trainability of PQCs, clear efforts in the context of reinforcement learning have so far been lacking. Therefore, in this study, we newly define the notion of expressivity suited to reinforcement learning and demonstrate that the mutual information between action distribution and reward-signal distribution can, in certain respects, indicate information about both expressivity and trainability. Such research is valuable in that it provides an easy criterion for choosing among various PQCs employed in reinforcement learning, and further, enables the indirect estimation of learning progress even in black-box settings where the agent's achievement aligned with the episodes cannot be explicitly evaluated.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A short note organizing the QPR program by distinguishing kinematics, operational content, and dynamics/bridges for future clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the distinction between kinematics, operational content, and dynamics/bridges in the context of extending relativity with a superluminal branch and its implications for quantum theory.

Method: Quantum principle of relativity (QPR) and its consistency constraints are analyzed alongside operational definitions of quantum superposition. Tachyonic QFT proposals are also considered.

Result: A structured approach to future research by separating kinematics (K), operational content (O), and dynamics/bridges (D/B).

Conclusion: The paper presents an organizational note emphasizing the need for clarity in the ambitious program to relate quantum theory to relativity. It outlines a three-layer framework for structuring future research.

Abstract: The quantum principle of relativity (QPR) puts forward an ambitious idea: extend special relativity with a formally superluminal branch of Lorentz-type maps, and treat the resulting consistency constraints as hints about why quantum theory has the structure it does [1]. The discussion that followed has emphasized a basic point: writing down coordinate maps is not the same thing as providing a physical theory. In particular, quantum superposition is not operationally defined by drawing multiple paths on paper: it is defined by what happens when alternatives recombine in an interference loop [2, 3]. In parallel, careful 1+1 analyses have clarified how sign conventions and time-orientation choices enter the superluminal formulas [4]. Finally, tachyonic QFT proposals suggest a possible mathematical bridge via an enlarged (twin) Hilbert space [5], although this proposal remains contested (e.g., on commutator covariance and microcausality grounds) [6]. The aim of this short note is organizational. We keep three layers separate: (K) kinematics (which maps exist and what they preserve), (O) operational content (what an experiment must actually reproduce, especially closed-loop interference), and (D/B) dynamics and bridges (how amplitudes and probabilities are generated, and how subluminal and superluminal sectors might be linked). The goal is not relativity derives quantum theory, but a clear checklist of what must be added for that ambition to become a well-posed programme.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the critical challenge of efficient encoding of classical data into quantum circuits for scalable quantum algorithms.

Method: Systematic partitioning of the total error budget between precision and approximation errors, supporting various state-of-the-art methods (multiplexer-based loaders, QROM, MPS, FSL, etc.).

Result: Resource reductions of over four orders of magnitude in computational fluid dynamics workflows, introduction of more efficient circuits for d-diagonal matrices, and optimized block encoding for kinetic energy operators.

Conclusion: The automated, approximation-aware compilation framework significantly reduces quantum resource costs and enhances the feasibility of large-scale quantum algorithms on resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Efficient encoding of classical data into quantum circuits is a critical challenge that directly impacts the scalability of quantum algorithms. In this work, we present an automated compilation framework for resource-aware quantum data loading tailored to a given input vector and target error tolerance. By explicitly exploiting the trade-off between exact and approximate state preparation, our approach systematically partitions the total error budget between precision and approximation errors, thereby minimizing quantum resource costs. The framework supports a comprehensive suite of state-of-the-art methods, including multiplexer-based loaders, quantum read-only memory (QROM) constructions, sparse encodings, matrix product states (MPS), Fourier series loaders (FSL), and Walsh transform-based diagonal operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across several applications, where it consistently uncovers non-obvious, resource-efficient strategies enabled by controlled approximation. In particular, we analyze a computational fluid dynamics workflow where the automated selection of MPS state preparation and Walsh transform-based encoding, combined with a novel Walsh-based measurement technique, leads to resource reductions of over four orders of magnitude compared to previous approaches. We also introduce two independent advances developed through the framework: a more efficient circuit for d-diagonal matrices, and an optimized block encoding for kinetic energy operators. Our results underscore the indispensable role of automated, approximation-aware compilation in making large-scale quantum algorithms feasible on resource-constrained hardware.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by cavity QED, the research aims to study the emergence of chaos in multilevel atoms with all-to-all interactions.

Method: The Schur-Weyl duality is used to analyze the Hilbert space structure, and a semiclassical description with spin coherent states is proposed to elucidate dynamical responses.

Result: The study identifies strong Hilbert space fragmentation due to the non-abelian nature of the symmetry, with regular dynamics in some sectors and chaos in others.

Conclusion: The study reveals a rich structure in multilevel all-to-all interacting models and contributes to understanding quantum-classical correspondence in chaotic systems.

Abstract: We study the emergence of chaos in multilevel atoms with all-to-all interactions, inspired by cavity QED. Focusing on a 3-level Tavis-Cummings model in a far detuned limit, we detail its deep Hilbert space structure -- i.e. we enumerate all distinct dynamical sectors, beyond the totally symmetric subspace -- by using the Schur-Weyl duality, which is applicable thanks to the permutation symmetry in the all-to-all Hamiltonian. Strong Hilbert space fragmentation ensues from the non-abelian nature of the symmetry, with some sectors displaying regular dynamics and others being chaotic. We uncover that many permutation symmetry sectors contribute to the dynamics in the classical limit, in addition to the commonly studied totally symmetric subspace. To elucidate the dynamical responses in each of the symmetry sectors, we propose a semiclassical description in terms of spin coherent states, which is also able to explain the origin of chaotic or regular dynamics with a simple geometrical argument. Our work contributes to the study of the quantum-classical correspondence in chaotic systems, and uncovers a rich structure in multilevel all-to-all interacting models.

Motivation: To reduce sampling overhead and improve the efficiency of simulating quantum many-body systems by leveraging recent advances in quantum algorithms and classical simulation techniques.

Method: Extends frameworks for quantum algorithms and classical simulation using projective measurements to real-time dynamics of quantum many-body systems, exploiting causal light-cone structure and interleaving time and space evolution.

Result: The method significantly reduces sampling overhead, reaches longer simulation times per sample compared to time-evolving block decimation, and enables the study of dynamics of entanglement in quantum hardware protocols.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that optimizations for quantum hardware can benefit classical tensor network simulations and provide insights into the utility of quantum simulations.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in quantum algorithms which measure and reuse qubits and in efficient classical simulation leveraging projective measurements, we extend these frameworks to real-time dynamics of quantum many-body systems undergoing discrete-time and continuous-time Hamiltonian evolution, and find improvements that significantly reduce sampling overhead. The approach exploits causal light-cone structure by interleaving time and space evolution and applying projective measurements as soon as local subsystems reach the target physical time, suppressing entanglement growth. Comparing to time-evolving block decimation, the method reaches longer times per sample for the same resources. We also gain the ability to study dynamics of entanglement that would be occurring on quantum hardware when following similar protocols, such as the holographic quantum dynamics simulation framework. We show how to efficiently obtain local observables as well as equal-time and time-dependent correlation functions. Our findings show how optimizations for quantum hardware can benefit classical tensor network simulations and how such classical methods can yield insights into the utility of quantum simulations.

Motivation: To efficiently address the challenges of treating multi-mode photonic environments in non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics, particularly for equilibrium properties of coupled light-matter systems.

Abstract: In this work, we detail different approaches to treat multi-mode photonic environments within non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics in the long-wavelength approximation efficiently. Specifically we show that for equilibrium properties of coupled light-matter systems, we can approximately capture the effects of multi-mode photonic environments on matter systems by either only keeping the polarization part of the electric field in the length-gauge formulation or by a few effective modes. We present a comprehensive set of approximation methods designed to accurately capture equilibrium phenomena in quantum light-matter systems across a range of complex photonic environments, from weak to strong coupling. These methods are applied to atomic and molecular models as well as to a two-dimensional quantum ring, demonstrating the versatility of our approach and laying the groundwork for first-principles simulations of real materials in cavity quantum electrodynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between continuous-variable quantum optics and neural networks, leveraging non-Gaussian resources for nonlinear effects and quantum analogs of artificial neurons.

Method: A novel framework utilizing coherent state input encoding, Gaussian transformations, multi-mode photon subtractions for processing, and homodyne detection for output readout. Classical simulation of QONN training is enabled by the QuaNNTO library.

Result: Derived closed-form expressions for the architecture, showed its satisfaction of the Universal Approximation Theorem within a single layer, and demonstrated balanced-resource efficiency in supervised learning and state-preparation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed continuous-variable quantum optical neural networks (QONNs) framework demonstrates strong expressivity and generalization capabilities, validating its potential for scalable photonic quantum machine learning and applications like non-Gaussian gate synthesis.

Abstract: Continuous-variables (CV) quantum optics is a natural formalism for neural networks (NNs) due to its ability to reproduce the information processing of such trainable interconnected systems. In quantum optics, Gaussian operators induce affine mappings on the quadratures of optical modes while non-Gaussian resources -- the challenging piece for physical implementation -- originate the nonlinear effects, unlocking quantum analogs of an artificial neuron. This work presents a novel experimentally-feasible framework for continuous-variable quantum optical neural networks (QONNs) developed with available photonic components: coherent states as input encoding, a general Gaussian transformation followed by multi-mode photon subtractions as the processing layer, and homodyne detection as outputs readout. The closed-form expressions of such architecture are derived demonstrating the family of adaptive activations and the quantum-optical neurons that emerge from the amount of photon-subtracted modes, proving that the proposed design satisfies the Universal Approximation Theorem within a single layer. To classically simulate the QONN training, the high-performance QuaNNTO library has been developed based on Wick--Isserlis expansion and Bogoliubov transformations, allowing multi-layer exact expectation values of non-Gaussian states without truncating the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Experiments on supervised learning and state-preparation tasks show balanced-resource efficiency with strong expressivity and generalization capabilities, illustrating the potential of the architecture for scalable photonic quantum machine learning and for quantum applications such as complex non-Gaussian gate synthesis.

TL;DR: A quantum computing framework for simulating non-equilibrium strongly-interacting matter was developed, validated on IBM's quantum computer, and shows promise for generalizing to SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a quantum computing framework for simulating energy loss and hadronization in non-equilibrium strongly-interacting matter, addressing the challenges of non-Abelian charge dynamics and multi-partite entanglement.

Method: The study employs quantum simulations on IBM's quantum computer, utilizing 18 qubits and quantum circuits with a two-qubit depth of 398. Techniques include state preparation, fermionic SWAP operations, and domain decomposition. Error mitigation ensures accurate results.

Result: Quantum simulations of a 1+1D SU(2) lattice system with heavy quarks were performed, yielding results consistent with classical simulations. Scalable quantum circuits and error mitigation techniques were successfully applied.

Conclusion: The framework for simulating non-equilibrium strongly-interacting matter on a quantum computer has been successfully established and validated, showing good agreement with classical simulations. The approach is scalable and generalizable to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3).

Abstract: Simulations of energy loss and hadronization are essential for understanding a range of phenomena in non-equilibrium strongly-interacting matter. We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\tt ibm\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations. The framework presented here generalizes straightforwardly to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in analog quantum simulations using qudits (d-level systems) by experimentally realizing the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model with a superconducting transmon qudit.

Method: An analog drive scheme is used to realize evolution under time-dependent local fields and one-axis twisting, combined with universal control and single-shot readout of the qudit state.

Result: Five finite-size precursors of quantum criticality in the LMG model were studied, including dynamical phase transitions, closing of the energy gap, Kibble-Zurek-like dynamics, statistics of the order parameter, and excited-state phase transitions.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the potential of high-dimensional transmon qudits for simulating complex many-body physics, paving the way for applications in quantum computational advantage.

Abstract: The simulation of large-scale quantum systems is one of the most sought-after applications of quantum computers. Of particular interest for near-term demonstrations of quantum computational advantage are analog quantum simulations, which employ analog controls instead of digitized gates. Most analog quantum simulations to date, however, have been performed using qubit-based processors, despite the fact that many physical systems are more naturally represented in terms of qudits (i.e., $d$-level systems). Motivated by this, we present an experimental realization of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using an analog simulator based on a single superconducting transmon qudit with up to $d = 9$ levels. This is accomplished by moving to a rotated frame in which evolution under any time-dependent local field and one-axis twisting can be realized by the application of multiple simultaneous drives. Combining this analog drive scheme with universal control and single-shot readout of the qudit state, we provide a detailed study of five finite-size precursors of quantum criticality in the LMG model: dynamical phase transitions, closing of the energy gap, Kibble-Zurek-like dynamics, statistics of the order parameter, and excited-state phase transitions. For each experiment we devise a protocol for extracting the relevant properties which does not require any prior knowledge of the system eigenstates, and can therefore be readily extended to higher dimensions or more complicated models. Our results cement high-dimensional transmon qudits as an exciting path towards simulating many-body physics.

Abstract: Photoelectrical detection of magnetic resonance (PDMR) offers a scalable alternative to optical readout of spin defects in semiconductors and is particularly promising for near-infrared (NIR) emitters, where photodetection is often challenging. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature coherent PDMR of PL3 (divacancy), PL5, PL6, and PL7 spins. PL7 and PL5 exhibit notably stronger PDMR than PL6 as opposed to optical detection, indicating higher ionization efficiency and suitability for electrical readout. Rabi oscillation and two-frequency spectroscopy reveal a previously undiscovered secondary resonance of PL7. We determine the zero-field splitting parameters of PL7 and assign the recently reported PL3a defect to PL7. The demonstrated PDMR of these NIR defects constitutes a key advancement toward quantum electronic devices.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, in the form of spin squeezing, is known to improve the sensitivity of atomic sensors to static or slowly varying fields. Sensing transient events presents a distinct challenge, requires different analysis tools, and has not been shown to benefit from entanglement in practically important scenarios such as spin-precession magnetometry. To address this, we apply concepts from continuous quantum measurements and estimation theory to optical atomic magnetometers, aiming to accurately model these devices, interpret their measurement data, control their dynamics, and achieve optimal sensitivity. Quantifying this optimal performance requires determining a fundamental quantum limit on sensitivity. We derive this limit, imposed by noise, and show that it scales at best linearly with sensing time and atom number N, ruling out any super-classical scaling. This limit is independent of the initial state, measurement, estimator, and measurement-based feedback, and depends only on the decoherence model and the strength of field fluctuations. Thus, finding an estimator that attains this bound proves the sensing strategy optimal. To approach this limit, we develop a quantum dynamical model scalable with N, based on a co-moving Gaussian approximation of the stochastic master equation, which includes measurement backaction and decoherence. This enables a real-time estimation and control architecture integrating an extended Kalman filter with a linear quadratic regulator. Simulating the magnetometer with our model and EKF+LQR strategy shows that quantum-limited tracking of constant and fluctuating fields is within reach of current atomic magnetometers. Our sensing strategy can also track biologically relevant signals, such as heartbeat-like waveforms, and drive the atomic ensemble into an entangled state, even when the measurement record is used for feedback but later discarded.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a minimal open quantum field theory analog of Vlasov-Maxwell FEL theory, where gain, dispersion, and noise arise from a unified framework.

Method: Using real-time Keldysh formalism and a microscopic Lagrangian for a relativistic electron beam coupled to a radiation mode, the authors construct a functional integral and integrate out electronic degrees of freedom.

Result: Closed analytic expressions for the retarded and Keldysh components of the self-energy are obtained, encoding frequency pulling, gain reduction, and noise spectrum. The FEL threshold is described as a continuous non-equilibrium phase transition.

Conclusion: The paper presents a non-equilibrium quantum field theory for free-electron lasers, unifying gain, dispersion, and noise within a single self-energy framework derived from the Preparata model.

Abstract: We develop a non-equilibrium quantum field theory of the free-electron laser based on the Preparata model, using the real-time Keldysh formalism. Starting from a microscopic Lagrangian for a relativistic electron beam coupled to a single radiation mode, we construct a Keldysh functional integral, perform the large-N rescaling, and integrate out the electronic degrees of freedom. This yields an effective action for the FEL mode in which dispersion, gain, and noise are all generated by a single electronic self-energy built from the current correlations of the beam. For a stationary Gaussian beam, we obtain closed analytic expressions for the retarded and Keldysh components of the self-energy, which directly encode frequency pulling, gain reduction due to energy spread, and the noise spectrum experienced by the field. At low frequency, the theory reduces to a Landau-Ginzburg-Keldysh description of a single complex mode with a mass, growth rate, nonlinearity, and noise strength fully determined by beam current, energy spread, and detuning. In this framework, the FEL threshold appears as a continuous non-equilibrium phase transition in the laser universality class: the coherent field amplitude plays the role of an order parameter, while the amplitude of critical fluctuations is fixed by the microscopic noise kernel. The result is a minimal open quantum field theory analog of Vlasov-Maxwell FEL theory, in which gain, dispersion, and noise arise from a unified self-energy framework rather than from separate phenomenological ingredients.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper shows how cavity QED can generate strongly correlated quantum matter by projecting atomic ensembles into a singlet state, leading to quantum spin liquids with exotic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to challenge the conventional view of cavity QED with atomic ensembles, showing that collective spin descriptions can lead to new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter rather than just collective spin phenomena.

Method: The method involves using uniform cavity-mediated interactions to project the system into the total-spin singlet sector, focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity to explore quantum spin liquids.

Result: The results demonstrate that global cavity fluctuations can transform classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, featuring non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that cavity QED can serve as a resource for inducing strongly correlated quantum phenomena, with potential applications in hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms.

Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics with atomic ensembles is typically associated with collective spin phenomena, such as superradiance and spin squeezing, in which the atoms evolve collectively as a macroscopic spin ($S\sim N/2$) on the Bloch sphere. Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms.

*Max P. Foreman,Jesse J. Slim,Warwick P. Bowen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A scalable method for optical-to-microwave quantum state transfer using feedback and a novel quantum transfer witness, advancing electro-optomechanical transducers for quantum networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of state transfer between light and microwaves in quantum networks, while relaxing constraints such as the need for resolved-sideband cavities and improving scalability and noise performance.

Method: The researchers extended a protocol by Navarathna et al., utilizing a broadband, sideband-unresolved cavity and feedback for optical quantum information transfer onto a mechanical resonator. They combined this with parametric mechanical-to-microwave conversion. The quantum transfer witness $ℱ_T$ was introduced to assess the transfer capability.

Result: Bidirectional optical-to-microwave quantum state transfer is enabled by all-optical coherent feedback, and the introduced quantum transfer witness demonstrates the ability to preserve Gaussian entanglement and outperform classical transduction schemes.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that continuous optical-to-microwave quantum state transfer is achievable using measurement-based feedback, with quantum-compatible noise performance within reach of current experimental capabilities. This expands the design space for electro-optomechanical transducers, enhancing their potential as scalable quantum links in quantum networks.

Abstract: State transfer between light and microwaves is a key challenge in quantum networks. Promising transducers use a mechanical intermediary that couples to both fields via radiation pressure. Such electro-optomechanical devices have achieved high efficiencies, yet require resolved-sideband cavities, and generally compromise in scalability and noise performance. Here, we relax this constraint by extending the protocol of Navarathna et al. that transfers optical quantum information onto a mechanical resonator using a broadband, sideband-unresolved cavity and feedback. Combining this with parametric mechanical-to-microwave conversion, we show that continuous optical-to-microwave quantum state transfer is possible using measurement-based feedback, while all-optical coherent feedback enables bidirectional transfer. To assess the transfer, we introduce the quantum transfer witness $\mathcal{W}_T$, which -- though similar to the input-referred added noise -- also identifies whether a channel is capable of both preserving Gaussian entanglement and outperforming classical transduction schemes. Finally, we show that quantum-compatible noise performance is within reach of current experimental capabilities. Our results unlock a new design space for electro-optomechanical transducers and strengthens their candidacy as scalable quantum links between distant nodes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of realizing high-fidelity quantum gates in the presence of realistic errors, which is crucial for quantum computing and communications architectures, especially for fault-tolerant quantum error correction.

Method: Combines room-temperature randomized benchmarking with a new class of composite pulses (PUDDINGs) robust to both frequency and amplitude errors, applied to single-qubit and two-qubit CNOT gates in an NV center in diamond.

Result: Demonstrated an improvement in error per gate by up to a factor of 9, with a record two-qubit error per gate of 1.2 × 10−5 (fidelity of 99.9988%).

Conclusion: The paper introduces PUDDINGs, a theoretical framework for constructing error-protected quantum gates, achieving record-high fidelity in two-qubit gates (99.9988%), which is far below the thresholds required for fault-tolerant quantum networks. This represents a significant advancement in solid-state quantum systems.

Abstract: High-fidelity quantum gates are a cornerstone of any quantum computing and communications architecture. Realizing such control in the presence of realistic errors at the level required for beyond-threshold quantum error correction is a long-standing challenge for all quantum hardware platforms. Here we theoretically develop and experimentally demonstrate error-protected quantum gates in a solid-state quantum network node. Our work combines room-temperature randomized benchmarking with a new class of composite pulses that are simultaneously robust to frequency and amplitude, affecting random and systematic errors. We introduce Power-Unaffected, Doubly-Detuning-Insensitive Gates (PUDDINGs) -- a theoretical framework for constructing conditional gates with immunity to both amplitude and frequency errors. For single-qubit and two-qubit CNOT gate demonstrations in a solid-state nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, we systematically measure an improvement in the error per gate up to a factor of 9. By projecting the application of PUDDING to cryogenic temperatures we show a record two-qubit error per gate of $1.2 \times 10^{-5}$, corresponding to a fidelity of $99.9988\%$, far below the thresholds required by surface and color code error correction. These results present viable building blocks for a new class of fault-tolerant quantum networks and represent the first experimental realization of error-protected conditional gates in solid-state systems.

TL;DR: Comparison of Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 dielectric loss shows Nb wiring in qubits has 30% higher loss than Ta wiring due to native pentoxide differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to understand the limiting losses in qubits by comparing the dielectric loss of Nb2O5 and Ta2O5, given recent observations of improved performance with Ta wiring in superconducting transmon qubits.

Method: The researchers deposited Nb2O5 and Ta2O5 of three thicknesses via pulsed laser deposition onto identical coplanar waveguide resonators to compare their dielectric loss properties.

Result: The results indicated that Nb2O5 has approximately 30% higher TLS loss than Ta2O5, suggesting higher loss in Nb wiring due to its native pentoxide and potential suboxides.

Conclusion: The study concludes that Nb wiring in superconducting transmon qubits exhibits higher loss due to the native pentoxide (Nb2O5) compared to Ta wiring (Ta2O5), with Nb2O5 showing about 30% higher two-level system (TLS) loss.

Abstract: Superconducting transmon qubits are commonly made with thin-film Nb wiring, but recent studies have shown increased performance with Ta wiring. In this work, we compare the resonator-induced single photon, millikelvin dielectric loss for pentoxides of Nb (Nb2O5) and Ta (Ta2O5) in order to further understand limiting losses in qubits. Nb and Ta pentoxides of three thicknesses are deposited via pulsed laser deposition onto identical coplanar waveguide resonators. The two-level system (TLS) loss in Nb2O5 is determined to be about 30% higher than that of Ta2O5. This work indicates that qubits with Nb wiring are affected by higher loss arising from the native pentoxide itself, likely in addition to the presence of suboxides, which are largely absent in Ta.

The methodology is successfully applied to synthesize two previously studied examples, validating the theoretical findings.

Abstract: We examine the classical limit of a fairly general nonlinear semiclassical hybrid system within a MaxEnt framework.

TL;DR: CMCS improves Monte Carlo efficiency by focusing on local observables' surroundings, achieving higher accuracy with fewer samples in short-range correlated systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional Monte Carlo sampling schemes often need many samples for accurate results. CMCS aims to improve efficiency by focusing on relevant local information in systems with short-range correlations.

Method: The proposed concentrated Monte Carlo sampling (CMCS) approach prioritizes detailed information in the surroundings of a local observable by considering all possible configurations nearby and using Markov chain Monte Carlo for the remaining setup.

Result: CMCS was tested on ground states of the spin-1/2 tilted Ising model and thermal states in the spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model, showing higher accuracy for local observables with fewer samples.

Conclusion: The concentrated Monte Carlo sampling (CMCS) approach demonstrates higher accuracy for local observables in short-range correlated states while requiring fewer samples, showcasing its potential for accelerating expectation value evaluations in specific regimes.

Abstract: Monte Carlo methods are widely used to estimate observables in many-body quantum systems. However, conventional sampling schemes often require a large number of samples to achieve sufficient accuracy. In this work we propose the concentrated Monte Carlo sampling approach, which builds on the idea that in systems with only short range correlations, to obtain accurate expectation values for local observables, one would favor detailed information in the surroundings of this observable compared to far away from it. In this approach we consider all possible configurations in the surroundings of a local observable, and unique samples from the remaining of the setup drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We have tested the performance of this approach for ground states of the spin-1/2 tilted Ising model in different phases, and also for thermal states in the a spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model. Our results demonstrate that CMCS yields higher accuracy for local observables in short-range correlated states while requiring substantially fewer samples, showcasing in which regimes one can obtain acceleration for the evaluation of expectation values.

TL;DR: Near-optimal robust shadow tomography algorithm with adversarial resilience, matching sample complexity of classical shadows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of learning expectation values of observables under adversarial corruption of outcomes, improving upon existing methods.

Method: The paper designs a non-adaptive algorithm robust to adversarial corruption, leveraging classical shadows and optimizing for error and sample complexity.

Result: The algorithm achieves an error of ε = Õ(γ max_{i∈[M]} ||O_i||_HS) with sample complexity n = (1/γ²) log(M/δ), matching the best-known bounds for uncorrupted cases.

Conclusion: The paper presents an algorithm for adversarially robust shadow tomography, achieving near-optimal error bounds and sample complexity. It also addresses the gap in prior work by providing a reduction from full-state tomography to shadow tomography.

Abstract: We study single-copy shadow tomography in the adversarial robust setting, where the goal is to learn the expectation values of $M$ observables $O_1, \ldots, O_M$ with $\varepsilon$ accuracy, but $γ$-fraction of the outcomes can be arbitrarily corrupted by an adversary. We show that all non-adaptive shadow tomography algorithms must incur an error of $\varepsilon=\tildeΩ(γ\min\{\sqrt{M}, \sqrt{d}\})$ for some choice of observables, even with unlimited copies. Unfortunately, the classical shadows algorithm by [HKP20] and naive algorithms that directly measure each observable suffer even more. We design an algorithm that achieves an error of $\varepsilon=\tilde{O}(γ\max_{i\in[M]}\|O_i\|_{HS})$, which nearly matches our worst-case error lower bound for $M\ge d$ and guarantees better accuracy when the observables have stronger structure. Remarkably, the algorithm only needs $n=\frac{1}{γ^2}\log(M/δ)$ copies to achieve that error with probability at least $1-δ$, matching the sample complexity of the classical shadows algorithm that achieves the same error without corrupted measurement outcomes. Our algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Classical simulation for fidelity estimation shows that our algorithm enjoys much stronger robustness than [HKP20] under adversarial noise. Finally, based on a reduction from full-state tomography to shadow tomography, we prove that for rank $r$ states, both the near-optimal asymptotic error of $\varepsilon=\tilde{O}(γ\sqrt{r})$ and copy complexity $\tilde{O}(dr^2/\varepsilon^2)=\tilde{O}(dr/γ^2)$ can be achieved for adversarially robust state tomography, closing the large gap in [ABCL25] where optimal error can only be achieved using pseudo-polynomial number of copies in $d$.

Conclusion: This approach enhances transparency and reproducibility in QCSC environments, supporting infrastructure-aware algorithm design and systematic experimentation.

Abstract: Quantum-centric supercomputing (QCSC) workflows often involve hybrid classical-quantum algorithms that are inherently probabilistic and executed on remote quantum hardware, making them difficult to interpret and limiting the ability to monitor runtime performance and behavior. The high cost of quantum circuit execution and large-scale high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure further restricts the number of feasible trials, making comprehensive evaluation of execution results essential for iterative development. We propose an observability architecture tailored for QCSC workflows that decouples telemetry collection from workload execution, enabling persistent monitoring across system and algorithmic layers and retaining detailed execution data for reproducible and retrospective analysis, eliminating redundant runs.

Result: Achieved an error rate approaching the theoretical limit and surpassed the linear key-rate bound over a fiber distance of 296.8 km.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical solution for frequency matching between independent lasers, applicable beyond QKD to fields requiring precise phase stabilization.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables information-theoretically secure communication against eavesdropping. However, phase instability remains a challenge across many QKD applications, particularly in schemes such as twin-field QKD and measurement-device-independent QKD. The most dominant source of phase fluctuation arises from the frequency offset between independent lasers. Here we propose a method to address this issue by employing a classical photodiode to compensate for the laser frequency difference. As an application of this method, we implement this technique in a mode-pairing QKD system, achieving an error rate approaching the theoretical limit and surpassing the linear key-rate bound over a fiber distance of 296.8 km. This approach provides a practical solution for frequency matching between independent lasers and can be extended to other fields requiring precise phase stabilization.

We provide an explicit characterization of the classical correlations achievable under these constraints. We then demonstrate that quantum communication systematically exceeds these classical limits, even in the absence of preshared entanglement and without any input choice for the receiver. Furthermore, we implement semidefinite hierarchy tools tailored to the two-sender, one-receiver setting for both types of constraints considered. Our results reveal a clear quantum advantage in multiparty communication under those restrictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a robust quantum memory system that can store quantum information accurately despite environmental noise, by integrating classical control mechanisms to adjust the system dynamics.

Method: The method involves modeling the system as an open quantum harmonic oscillator governed by Hudson-Parthasarathy equations and employing a classical linear time-varying controller with linear-quadratic-Gaussian control and fixed-point smoothing techniques.

Result: The results demonstrate that the closed-loop system, combining quantum and classical dynamics, successfully mitigates deviations from initial conditions through optimal control strategies.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed quantum memory system, supported by classical control methods, effectively compensates for environmental noise and maintains the fidelity of stored quantum information.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with a quantum memory system for storing quantum information in the form of its initial dynamic variables in the presence of environmental noise. In order to compensate for the deviation from the initial conditions, the classical parameters of the system Hamiltonian are affected by the actuator output of a measurement-based classical controller. The latter uses an observation process produced by a measuring apparatus from the quantum output field of the memory system. The underlying system is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator whose Heisenberg evolution is governed by linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations. The controller is organised as a classical linear time-varying system, so that the resulting closed-loop system has quantum and classical dynamic variables. We apply linear-quadratic-Gaussian control and fixed-point smoothing at the level of the first two moments and consider controllers with a separation structure which involve a continuously updated estimate for the initial quantum variables. The initial-point smoother is used for actuator signal formation so as to minimise the sum of a mean-square deviation of the quantum memory system variables at a given time horizon from their initial values and an integral quadratic penalty on the control signal.

Motivation: To clarify the relationship between phase space negativities and classical simulability in bosonic systems, especially when quantum information is encoded.

Method: The paper introduces a general framework to relate physical phase space structures to computational representations across arbitrary dimensions and encodings, emphasizing the role of reference frames.

Result: The proposed framework successfully connects physical and computational phase space representations, identifying the reference frame as a key factor in simulability.

Conclusion: The framework presented connects physical phase space structures to computational representations, elucidating the role of reference frames in linking simulability properties and highlighting the potential disappearance of quantum features in the planar phase space limit.

Abstract: Phase space quasi-probability functions provide powerful representations of quantum states and operators, as well as criteria for assessing quantum computational resources. In discrete, odd-dimensional systems (qudits), protocols involving only non-negative phase space distributions can be efficiently classically simulated. For bosonic systems, defined in continuous variables, phase space negativities are likewise necessary to prevent efficient classical simulation of the underlying physical processes. However, when quantum information is encoded in bosonic systems, this connection becomes subtler: as negativity is only a necessary property for potential quantum advantage, encoding (i.e., physical) states may exhibit large negativities while still corresponding to architectures that remain classically simulable. Several frameworks have attempted to relate non-negativity of states and gates in the computational phase space to non-negativity of processes in the physical bosonic phase space, but a consistent correspondence remains elusive. Here, we introduce a general framework that connects the physical phase space structure of bosonic systems to their encoded computational representations across arbitrary dimensions and encodings. This framework highlights the key role of the reference frame-equivalently, the choice of vacuum-in defining the computational basis and linking its phase space simulability properties to those of the physical system. Finally, we provide computational and physical interpretations of the planar (quadrature-like) phase space limit, where genuinely quantum features may gradually vanish, yielding classically simulable behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous adversarial models and a clear understanding of quantum coherence's role in randomness generation in QRNGs based on spontaneous emission.

Method: The authors developed a quantum information-theoretic framework to analyze randomness generation in spontaneous emission processes. They characterized two distinct eavesdropping scenarios and evaluated the security of different QRNG schemes.

Result: The analysis revealed vulnerabilities in certain QRNG schemes (single-photon detection and temporal mode measurements) against one type of adversary, while showing robustness in others (spatial mode detection and phase fluctuations).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that QRNG based on spatial mode detection and phase fluctuations is secure against both types of adversaries, whereas single-photon detection and temporal mode measurements are vulnerable to one type of adversary. The paper provides a quantitative framework for calculating intrinsic randomness in spontaneous-emission-based QRNGs.

Abstract: Quantum coherence serves as a fundamental resource for generating intrinsic randomness, yet the quantification of randomness in quantum random number generators (QRNGs) based on spontaneous emission has remained largely phenomenological. Existing randomness analysis lacks rigorous adversarial models and a clear characterization of the role of quantum coherence in these systems. In this work, we develop a comprehensive quantum information-theoretic framework for randomness generation in spontaneous emission processes. We characterize two distinct eavesdropping strategies: one where the adversary directly accesses the atom ensemble, and the other where the adversary accesses only its purification. Our analysis reveals that when randomness is generated through single-photon detection and temporal mode measurements, the QRNG is vulnerable to the first adversary scenario, though it still guarantees a lower bound on intrinsic randomness against the second adversary scenario even under maximal information leakage from the atoms. In contrast, QRNGs based on spatial mode detection and phase fluctuations demonstrate security against both types of adversaries, providing robust randomness generation. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative calculation of intrinsic randomness for these spontaneous-emission-based QRNG schemes.

Method: The study introduces assisted quantum erasure, analyzes the role of correlations in reducing energetic costs, and develops operational protocols in device-dependent and one-sided device-independent scenarios.

Result: Entanglement of formation is identified as the key thermodynamic resource in device-dependent scenarios, and an operational erasure protocol is developed for one-sided device-independent settings.

Conclusion: The findings elevate quantum erasure from a thermodynamic constraint to an operational primitive, with erasure work cost serving as a measure of secure and exclusive control over quantum memory.

Abstract: Erasing memory is a fundamental operational task in quantum information processing, governed by Landauer's principle, which links information loss to thermodynamic work. We introduce and analyze assisted quantum erasure, where correlations with a remote system reduce the energetic cost of resetting a memory. We identify exclusive control of erasure as the central operational requirement: only a designated party should be able to achieve the minimal cost, while any adversary necessarily fails. In the device-dependent regime, we show that entanglement of formation exactly characterizes exclusivity, establishing entanglement as the decisive thermodynamic resource. Moving to a one-sided device-independent scenario, in which only the memory holder's device is trusted, we develop an operational erasure protocol based on random dephasing and conditional operations. These results elevate quantum erasure from a thermodynamic constraint to an operational primitive: the erasure work cost quantifies secure, exclusive control over quantum memory, guaranteeing that an unauthorized agent cannot fully erase information under bounded work.

Abstract: Large superconducting quantum circuits have a number of important applications in quantum computing. Accurately predicting the performance of these devices from first principles is challenging, as it requires solving the many-body Schrödinger equation. This work introduces a new, general ab-initio method for analyzing large quantum circuits based on lattice field theory, a tool commonly applied in nuclear and particle physics. This method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques such as tensor networks, but avoids introducing systematic errors due to truncation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space associated with superconducting phases. The approach is applied to fluxonium, a specific many-component superconducting qubit with favorable qualities for quantum computation. A systematic study of the influence of impedance on fluxonium is conducted that parallels previous experimental studies, and ground capacitance effects are explored. The qubit frequency and charge noise dephasing rate are extracted from statistical analyses of charge noise, where thousands of instantiations of charge disorder in the Josephson junction array of a fixed fluxonium qubit are explicitly averaged over at the microscopic level. This is difficult to achieve with any other existing method.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A continuous-time framework for quantum processes is introduced to address non-Markovian dynamics under continuous monitoring, overcoming limitations of discrete-time models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for quantum measurements lack a model-independent description for arbitrary non-Markovian processes and are restricted to discrete interventions, failing to represent finite-duration measurements.

Method: Introducing a continuous-time extension of multi-time quantum processes based on process and operation functionals, generalizing the Feynman-Vernon influence functional and formulating a continuous Born rule.

Result: The proposed framework successfully generalizes quantum processes and operations to continuous time, enabling the analysis of non-Markovian dynamics under continuous monitoring.

Conclusion: The framework introduced provides a consistent representation of non-Markovian dynamics under continuous monitoring and defines Markovianity in continuous time, demonstrating practical applicability through the analysis of a generalized Caldeira-Leggett model.

Abstract: Continuous measurements are central to quantum control and sensing, yet lack a model-independent operational description that can be applied to arbitrary non-Markovian processes without specifying a microscopic measurement model. Existing multi-time frameworks, such as process matrices, allow for an arbitrary sequence of operations to be applied on a general process, but are restricted to interventions at discrete times and cannot represent measurements of finite duration. We introduce a continuous-time extension of multi-time quantum processes based on process and operation functionals, which generalize the Feynman-Vernon influence functional and yield a continuous Born rule that cleanly separates processes from operations. This framework provides a consistent representation of non-Markovian dynamics under continuous monitoring and leads to a natural definition of Markovianity in continuous time. We illustrate the formalism by analyzing continuous measurements in a generalized Caldeira-Leggett model, demonstrating its applicability to realistic non-Markovian scenarios.

TL;DR: Researchers used BCTDS to study TLS defects in amorphous dielectrics, revealing coherent dynamics and control, a spectral density of 84 GHz^-1, and establishing BCTDS as a versatile tool for broadband defect spectroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Defects in solid-state materials significantly impact coherence, stability, and performance in quantum technologies. While narrowband techniques exist, a broadband approach is needed to capture the full spectrum of defect properties and dynamics.

Method: The researchers used Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS) to study coherent control and time-resolved dynamics of TLS defect ensembles over a 3-5 GHz frequency range, without requiring full device fabrication.

Result: The study revealed quantum interference effects, memory-dependent dynamics, and dressed-state evolution within the TLS defect bath. Additionally, a TLS defect spectral density of 84 GHz^-1 for a silicon sample was extracted, and coherent dynamics were directly evidenced through amplitude- and phase-controlled interference fringes.

Conclusion: The study establishes BCTDS as a versatile platform for broadband defect spectroscopy, offering new capabilities for diagnosing and mitigating sources of decoherence, engineering many-body dynamics, and exploring non-equilibrium phenomena in disordered quantum systems.

Abstract: Defects in solid-state materials play a central role in determining coherence, stability, and performance in quantum technologies. Although narrowband techniques can probe specific resonances with high precision, a broadband spectroscopic approach captures the full spectrum of defect properties and dynamics. Two-level system (TLS) defects in amorphous dielectrics are a particularly important example because they are major sources of decoherence and energy loss in superconducting quantum devices. However, accessing and characterizing their collective dynamics remains far more challenging than probing individual TLS defects. Building on our previously developed Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS) technique, we study the coherent control and time-resolved dynamics of TLS defect ensembles over a wide frequency range of 3-5 GHz without requiring full device fabrication, revealing quantum interference effects, memory-dependent dynamics, and dressed-state evolution within the TLS defect bath. The spectral response reveals distinct V-shaped structures corresponding to the bare eigenmode frequencies. Using these features, we extract a TLS defect spectral density of 84 GHz^-1 for a silicon sample, across a 4.1-4.6 GHz span. Furthermore, we systematically investigate amplitude- and phase-controlled interference fringes for multiple temperatures and inter-pulse delays, providing direct evidence of coherent dynamics and control. A driven minimal spin model with dipole-dipole interactions that qualitatively capture the observed behavior is presented. Our results establish BCTDS as a versatile platform for broadband defect spectroscopy, offering new capabilities for diagnosing and mitigating sources of decoherence, engineering many-body dynamics, and exploring non-equilibrium phenomena in disordered quantum systems.

Abstract: The study of dynamic systems at the nanometer scale can benefit from the loss and background resilience offered by quantum two-photon interference. However, fast measurements with the required resolution are difficult to realize. As a solution, we introduce extreme energy entanglement between the photons undergoing interference. Using a flux probing analysis technique, we recover vibrational signals with frequencies as high as 21 kHz. Along with validating nanometer-scale precision and accuracy, we observe a significant quantum advantage when measuring in the presence of loss and background.
