### [1] [Low-temperature entropies and possible states in geometrically frustrated magnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02899)
*Siyu Zhu,Arthur P. Ramirez,Sergey Syzranov*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Simulations and experiments suggest that higher-spin triangular-lattice compounds' low-energy states are describable by doublet states, emphasizing the role of entropy in understanding GF materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the properties of spin states in insulating magnetic materials by analyzing the entropy released upon cooling, particularly in geometrically frustrated (GF) compounds.

Method: The research involves numerical simulations of entropy released by higher-spin triangular-lattice layered systems and SCGO lattices, and compares experimental entropy measurements in GF compounds with theoretical values from classical models.

Result: The results show that the entropy values can reveal the structure of low-energy magnetic states in GF compounds, with specific comparisons made to experimental data from compounds like NiGa2S4, FeAl2Se4, and SCGO/BSZCGO.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the lowest-energy states of higher-spin layered triangular-lattice compounds can be described using doublet states on individual magnetic sites, and highlights the importance of accurate thermodynamic measurements in geometrically frustrated magnetic materials.

Abstract: The entropy that an insulating magnetic material releases upon cooling can
reveal important information about the properties of spin states in that
material. In many geometrically frustrated (GF) magnetic compounds, the heat
capacity exhibits a low-temperature peak that comes from the spin states
continuously connected to the ground states of classical models, such as the
Ising model, on the same GF lattice, which manifests in the amount of entropy
associated with this heat-capacity peak. In this work, we simulate numerically
the values of entropy released by higher-spin triangular-lattice layered
systems and materials on SCGO lattices. We also compare the experimentally
measured values of entropy in several strongly GF compounds, $NiGa_2S_4$,
$FeAl_2Se_4$ and SCGO/BSZCGO, with possible theoretical values inferred from
the classical models to which the quantum states of those materials may be
connected. This comparison suggests that the lowest-energy states of
higher-spin layered triangular-lattice compounds can be described in terms of
doublet states on individual magnetic sites. Our analyses demonstrate how the
values of entropy can reveal the structure of low-energy magnetic states in GF
compounds and call for more accurate thermodynamic measurement in GF magnetic
materials.

### [2] [The nexus between negative charge-transfer and reduced on-site Coulomb energy in correlated topological metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03299)
*A. R. Shelke,C. -W. Chuang,S. Hamamoto,M. Oura,M. Yoshimura,N. Hiraoka,C. -N. Kuo,C. -S. Lue,A. Fujimori,A. Chainani*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Study reveals the electronic conditions (reduced Udd and negative Δ) enabling topological behavior in CoTe2 and NiTe2, contrasting with CoO and NiO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why CoTe2 and NiTe2 do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in similar materials like CoO and NiO.

Method: Utilized valence band resonant photoemission spectroscopy and charge-transfer cluster model simulations to analyze electronic parameters.

Result: Found Udd = 3.0 eV for CoTe2 and 3.7 eV for NiTe2, with negative charge-transfer energy (Δ) values indicating the conditions for achieving topological behavior.

Conclusion: The study identifies the electronic structure framework that enables topological behavior in CoTe2 and NiTe2 through a combination of negative charge-transfer energy and reduced on-site Coulomb energy.

Abstract: The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) CoTe$_2$ and
NiTe$_2$ are topological Dirac Type-II metals. Their $d$-bands do not exhibit
the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO and NiO. We address
this conundrum by quantifying the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via
single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation
satellite using valence band resonant photoemission spectroscopy (PES), and
obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV/3.7 eV for CoTe$_2$/NiTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT)
cluster model simulations of the measured core-level PES and x-ray absorption
spectra of CoTe$_2$ and CoO validate their contrasting electronic
parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe$_2$,
and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength
$T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$<$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in
CoTe$_2$ is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from
ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced
$U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$>$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a
topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$${p}$ type lowest energy excitations.
Similarly, we obtain a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe$_2$
compared to NiO. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and
reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for
achieving topological behavior via band inversion in correlated metals.

### [3] [Moiré modulated quantum spin liquid candidate 1T-TaSe$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03311)
*Ziying Wang,Adolfo O. Fumega,Ana Vera Montoto,Mohammad Amini,Büşra Gamze Arslan,Aleš Cahlík,Yuxiao Ding,Jose L. Lado,Robert Drost,Peter Liljeroth*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: IETS via STM/STS provides atomic-scale insights into 2D quantum spin liquids, as demonstrated on 1T-TaSe$_2$, revealing key excitations consistent with a modulated spin liquid state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of sensitive experimental techniques to probe two-dimensional quantum spin liquids has hindered the study of materials like $α$-RuCl$_3$ and 1T-TaSe$_2$. STM and STS have been suggested as promising methods to access the spinon spectrum through IETS.

Method: The researchers employed scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to measure low-energy inelastic excitations in the quantum spin liquid candidate material 1T-TaSe$_2$.

Result: The observations revealed a $√3×√3$ reconstruction driven by the substrate, uniform spectroscopy across spin sites, and the coexistence of zero and finite energy excitations, consistent with a modulated $√3×√3$ spin liquid ground state.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) is a powerful tool for studying quantum spin liquids, particularly in two-dimensional materials, by providing atomic-scale insights into their magnetic excitations.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are quantum phases of matter featuring collectively
entangled states and emergent fractional many-body excitations. While methods
exist to probe three-dimensional quantum spin liquids experimentally, these
techniques lack the sensitivity to probe two-dimensional quantum spin liquids.
This seriously hampers the study of potential monolayer quantum spin liquid
candidates such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and 1T-TaSe$_2$. Scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) have recently been suggested as
promising probes of the quantum spin liquid state, as they can access the
spinon spectrum through inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). In this work,
we employ this approach on the quantum spin liquid candidate material
1T-TaSe$_2$ and directly measure its low-energy inelastic excitations. We
observe the emergence of a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ reconstruction driven by
the substrate, equivalent spectroscopy across all spin sites and coexistence of
zero and finite energy excitations. We show that these observations are
consistent with a modulated $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ spin liquid ground state.
Our results demonstrate that IETS provides a powerful route to obtain
atomic-scale insight into the magnetic excitations of two-dimensional
materials, allowing to explore the effects of moir\'e modulations on potential
quantum liquid phases.

### [4] [Free Majorana Modes in Superconducting Quantum Wires](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03380)
*Karyn Le Hur*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to realize Majorana zero modes in superconducting wires using magnetic impurities, demonstrating their protection by spin gaps and impurity resonance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the realization of Majorana fermions (Majorana zero modes) in a superconducting wire model, specifically focusing on the interaction of magnetic impurities with an s-wave superconductor and their role in protecting free Majorana solutions.

Method: Introducing a magnetic spin-1/2 impurity interacting with a spin-bound state in a Luther-Emery wire, which represents a Hubbard ladder in a d-wave superconducting state, and analyzing zero-energy edge solutions.

Result: The study shows that Majorana zero modes can emerge from the two-channel Kondo effect in superconducting wires, with the spin gap and impurity resonance protecting these modes against perturbations.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that Majorana zero modes can be realized in a superconducting wire model through the interaction of magnetic impurities with spin-bound states, bridging the gap between s-wave superconducting wires.

Abstract: An s-wave superconducting wire with attractive interactions can admit a
zero-energy bound state equation (solution) at an edge similar to the
Jackiw-Rebbi model; this is a specific aspect of low-dimensional quantum
systems, Dirac equation and e.g. of the Luther-Emery liquid with a spin gap. In
this Letter, K. Le Hur Europhys. Lett., 49 (6), pp. 768-774 (2000), I
introduced a magnetic spin-1/2 impurity interacting with such a (spin) bound
state in a Luther-Emery wire representing then a Hubbard ladder in a d-wave
superconducting state. This method is general and show how Majorana fermions at
zero energy, i.e. Majorana zero modes, can take place in a superconducting wire
model from the two-channel Kondo effect. Within these two channels (wires), the
Luther-Emery form of the superconducting term can be reached within the
weak-coupling attractive limit. Due to the interest in Majorana zero modes from
magnetic impurities interacting with an s-wave superconductor, I take time to
analyze zero-energy edge solutions in my model and present a correspondence
with the p-wave superconducting wire in the topological phase through
alternatives versions of the quantum field theory. I develop the relation
between the edge magnetic susceptibility and the local capacitance measure in a
p-wave superconducting wire. I elaborate on the idea that Majorana zero modes,
i.e. free Majorana fermions, can be realized with magnetic impurities bridging
the gap between two s-wave superconducting wires. The spin gap and the
resonance with the impurity can protect the free Majorana solutions when
including perturbations.

### [5] [SC$^*$ Superconductivity and Spin Stiffnesses in the SU(2) Gauge Theory of the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03436)
*Demetrio Vilardi,Pietro M. Bonetti*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explores the SU(2) gauge theory for spin fluctuations in the Hubbard model, finding that superconductivity suppresses spin stiffnesses and enhances quantum spin fluctuations, potentially stabilizing quantum disorder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the instability to a superconducting state SC* arising from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) where pairing between chargons occurs, and to understand the feedback of superconductivity on spin fluctuations.

Method: We employ the SU(2) gauge theory for spin fluctuations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model, where the electron field is fractionalized into spinons (described by a non-linear sigma model) and chargons (treated as fermions at a mean-field level).

Result: A coexisting phase with both magnetic and superconducting order for chargons is found, and superconductivity significantly suppresses spatial and temporal spin stiffnesses, enhancing quantum spin fluctuations.

Conclusion: Superconductivity significantly suppresses spin stiffnesses, enhancing quantum spin fluctuations and potentially stabilizing quantum disorder against long-range magnetic ordering.

Abstract: We consider the SU(2) gauge theory for spin fluctuations in the
two-dimensional Hubbard model, where the electron field is fractionalized in
terms of spinons and chargons. In this theory, spinons are described by a
non-linear sigma model, while chargons are treated as fermions at a mean-field
level. We investigate the instability to a superconducting state SC*, arising
from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) where pairing between chargons occurs.
Consistent with previous studies, our analysis reveals a coexisting phase
characterized by both magnetic and superconducting order for the chargons. The
central contribution of this work is the calculation of the feedback of
superconductivity on spatial and temporal spin stiffnesses, thereby quantifying
its impact on spin fluctuations. Our key finding is that superconductivity
significantly suppresses these spin stiffnesses, enhancing quantum spin
fluctuations. This enhancement suggests that superconductivity can play a
crucial role in stabilizing quantum disorder against long-range magnetic
ordering.

### [6] [Unraveling Deconfined Quantum Criticality in Non-Hermitian Easy-Plane $J$-$Q$ Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03456)
*Xuan Zou,Shuai Yin,Zi-Xiang Li,Hong Yao*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: QMC simulations on a non-Hermitian $J$-$Q$ model show weakened first-order transitions, supporting a quasi-critical transition near a complex fixed point, possibly linked to DQCP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the transition in the $J$-$Q$ model is genuinely a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) or weakly first-order, and to explore the effects of non-Hermitian interactions on such transitions.

Method: Sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation was performed on a non-Hermitian easy-plane $J$-$Q$ model to explore the impact of non-Hermitian interactions on the transition.

Result: The first-order transitions diminish with non-Hermitian interactions, suggesting the transition is quasi-critical and potentially near a complex fixed point governed by a non-unitary conformal field theory (CFT).

Conclusion: The non-Hermitian interaction in the $J$-$Q$ model facilitates the approach towards a complex fixed point, possibly describing a quasi-critical transition near the DQCP, as supported by QMC simulations.

Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) characterizes the continuous
transition beyond Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm, occurring between two phases
that exhibit distinct symmetry breaking. The debate over whether genuine DQCP
exists in physical SU(2) spin systems or the transition is weakly first-order
has persisted for many years. In this letter, we construct a non-Hermitian
easy-plane $J$-$Q$ model and perform sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo
(QMC) simulation to explore the impact of non-Hermitian microscopic
interactions on the transition that potentially features a DQCP. Our results
demonstrate that the intensity of the first-order transitions significantly
diminishes with the amplification of non-Hermitian interactions, serving as
numerical evidence to support the notion that the transition in $J$-$Q$ model
is quasi-critical, possibly in the vicinity of the fixed point governing DQCP
in the complex plane, described by a non-unitary conformal field theory (CFT).
The non-Hermitian interaction facilitates the approach towards such a complex
fixed point in the parameter regime. Furthermore, our QMC study on the
non-Hermitian J-Q model opens a new route to numerically investigating the
nature of complex CFT in the microscopic model.

### [7] [Quantum effects in the magnon spectrum of 2D altermagnets via continuous similarity transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03528)
*Raymond Wiedmann,Dag-Björn Hering,Vanessa Sulaiman,Matthias R. Walther,Kai P. Schmidt,Götz S. Uhrig*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper studies quantum effects on magnon excitations in 2D altermagnets using a continuous similarity transformation, revealing altermagnetic spin splitting and roton minima, with noted divergencies signaling potential issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to investigate quantum effects on magnon excitations in a minimal spin-1/2 Heisenberg model for 2D altermagnets on the square lattice, focusing on altermagnetic spin splitting and the roton minimum.

Method: The paper applies a continuous similarity transformation in momentum space to derive an effective Hamiltonian that conserves the number of magnon excitations, enabling quantitative calculations of one-magnon dispersion, magnon-magnon interactions, and dynamic structure factor.

Result: Results include the derivation of an effective Hamiltonian, calculation of one-magnon dispersion, observation of magnon-magnon interactions, and identification of divergencies in the transformation process.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the continuous similarity transformation is effective in deriving an altermagnetic spin splitting and identifying the roton minimum, but divergencies in the transformation signal potential breakdowns or significant magnon decay.

Abstract: We investigate quantum effects on magnon excitations in a minimal spin-1/2
Heisenberg model for 2D altermagnets on the square lattice. A continuous
similarity transformation is applied in momentum space to derive an effective
Hamiltonian that conserves the number of magnon excitations. This allows us to
quantitatively calculate the one-magnon dispersion, the effects of
magnon-magnon interactions, and the dynamic structure factor in a certain range
of parameters. In particular, we focus on the altermagnetic spin splitting of
the magnon bands and the size of the roton minimum. We further map out
divergencies of the continuous similarity transformation for different types of
generators, which signal either the breakdown of the N\'eel-ordered phase or
the presence of significant magnon decay.

*A. Yu. Levakhova,A. L. Vasiliev,N. S. Pavlov,A. V. Ovcharov,V. I. Bondarenko,A. V. Sadakov,K. S. Pervakov,V. A. Vlasenko,V. M. Pudalov*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Nano-defects in EuSn2As2 form a new phase (EuSnAs2) causing local ferromagnetism, explaining its puzzling magnetic behaviors like nonlinear magnetization and hysteresis in low fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aimed to understand the puzzling magnetic properties of the antiferromagnetic layered semimetal EuSn2As2, particularly the nonlinear magnetization and ferromagnetic hysteresis observed in low fields.

Method: The study utilized high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, microstructural analysis, and DFT analysis to investigate the structural and magnetic properties of EuSn2As2.

Result: Planar nano-defects in EuSn2As2 create a layer of a distinct phase (EuSnAs2) with local ferromagnetic ordering, leading to weak ferromagnetic behavior within the antiferromagnetic host lattice.

Conclusion: The study reveals that planar nano-defects in EuSn2As2 form a distinct phase (EuSnAs2) promoting local ferromagnetic ordering, which explains several puzzling magnetic properties of the material, such as nonlinear magnetization and ferromagnetic-type hysteresis.

Abstract: We report a study of nano-scale structural peculiarities of the
antiferromagnetic layered semimetal EuSn2As2, and show that they are
responsible for its puzzling magnetic properties. The high resolution
transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of planar defects in the
lattice of the studied single crystals. Using a combination of microstructural
and DFT analysis we demonstrated that a single planar nano-defects forms a
layer of a distinct phase EuSnAs2, that is different from the EuSn2As2 phase of
the bulk lattice. The smaller distance between Eu layers in the planar
nano-defect promotes formation of local ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of the Eu
atoms. On average, the planar defects form a weak ferromagnetic phase in the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) host lattice. The obtained results explain several
puzzling features in magnetic properties of A-type AFM materials: the nonlinear
magnetization in low in-plane fields, ferromagnetic-type hysteresis in low
field, and the upturn of the magnetic susceptibility in the AFM state at
temperatures approaching zero.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of dielectric confinement and plate geometry on the optical functions of CdSe nanoplatelets, and to explore the effects of temperature and short-pulse excitation on the spectra.

Method: The study involves calculations of linear and nonlinear optical functions of CdSe nanoplatelets, considering dielectric confinement effects on excitonic states, and analyzing both stationary and non-stationary excitation regimes.

Result: Analytical expressions for absorption coefficient, exciton resonance energy, and binding energy are derived. The study highlights the influence of nanoplatelet geometry (thickness, lateral dimension) and temperature on the spectra.

Conclusion: The obtained results are compared with available experimental data, validating the analytical expressions for absorption coefficient, exciton resonance energy, and binding energy.

Abstract: We show how to calculate the linear and nonlinear optical functions of CdSe
nanoplatelets, taking into account the effect of a dielectric confinement on
excitonic states. We consider both stationary and non-stationary excitation
regime. We obtain obtain analytical expressions for the absorption coefficient,
the exciton resonance energy and binding energy of nanoplatelets. The impact of
plate geometry (thickness, lateral dimension) on the spectrum is discussed. In
the nonlinear case we analyze the impact of temperature. For the short-pulse

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the nonlinear optical properties and quantum behavior of Rydberg excitons in Cu2O crystals under pulsed laser excitation.

Method: Investigation of nonlinear refraction and Kerr phase shift in Cu2O crystals induced by short-time pulses, with analysis of quantum beats in exciton emission spectra.

Result: Observation of quantum beats and their dependence on exciton state, laser power, and dissipative factors.

Conclusion: The study reveals significant insights into the quantum beats phenomenon in Cu2O crystals, highlighting dependencies on exciton state number, laser power, and dissipative processes.

Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear refraction and the nonlinear Kerr phase shift
which are due to Rydberg excitons induced in Cu2O crystal by short-time pulses.
We observe the phenomenon of quantum beats, analogous to that observed in

### [11] [Extrinsic anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03151)
*A. Osin,A. Levchenko,M. Khodas*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Extrinsic AHC is significant in certain altermagnets due to spin-orbit coupling and exchange splitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relative contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic AHC in altermagnets and explore their dependence on spin-orbit coupling and exchange splitting.

Method: Investigation of the extrinsic AHC in altermagnetic spin Laue groups, especially under large exchange splitting and spin-orbit coupling effects.

Result: Extrinsic AHC is found comparable to intrinsic AHC in half of the altermagnetic spin Laue groups under large exchange splitting. It is crucial in materials with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, even in the clean limit, but negligible in other cases.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significant role of extrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in altermagnets, particularly in certain spin Laue groups and those with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, despite its negligible impact in others.

Abstract: We find the extrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) to be comparable to
the intrinsic one in roughly half of the altermagnetic spin Laue groups in the
limit of large exchange splitting. In materials with a finite
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type interaction, the extrinsic contribution is essential
even in the clean limit. In other altermagnets it is mostly negligible. This
peculiar behavior is linked to the nonanalytic dependence of the intrinsic AHC
on spin-orbit coupling. Both originate from the lifting of the spin degeneracy
along the nodal planes as the weak spin-orbit coupling breaks the
nonrelativistic spin symmetry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索非互易磁输运现象的微观机制，以开发新型整流和探测技术。

Method: 通过实验发现NRMT的罕见四次方标度律，并结合理论与实验的定量一致性，揭示了LSK机制。

Result: 发现LSK是BiTeBr中NRMT的主导机制，并首次观测到NRMT的四次方标度律。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Lorentz skew scattering (LSK)是BiTeBr中非互易磁输运(NRMT)的主导机制，并提出通过增强电子弛豫时间来增强NRMT效应的通用原则，为低耗散整流器和高性能量子电子器件设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: In materials with broken inversion symmetry, nonreciprocal magneto-transport
(NRMT) manifests as a bilinear dependence of charge conductivity on applied
electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields. This phenomenon is deeply rooted in
symmetry and electronic quantum geometry, holding promise for novel
rectification and detector technologies. Existing experimental studies
generally attribute NRMT to Zeeman-driven mechanisms and exhibit quadratic
scaling with conductivity. Here, we report a previously unknown NRMT
microscopic mechanism - Lorentz skew scattering (LSK) - revealed through the
discovery of an unprecedented quartic scaling law of NRMT as well as
quantitative agreement between theory and experiment in BiTeBr. LSK emerges
from the interplay of Lorentz force and skew scattering, bridging classical
field effect to quantum scattering effect on the Fermi surface. We demonstrate
that the LSK dominates NRMT in BiTeBr, and elucidate that this dominance over
other possible contributions stems from high mobility and strong Rashba
splitting. The finding of LSK mechanism is of unique importance because it
unveils the leading NRMT effect in high-mobility systems and suggests a
universal principle towards strong NRMT by enhancing electronic relaxation time
in topological materials, rendering a new designing idea for low-dissipation
rectifiers and high-performance quantum electronics.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A giant, magnetic-field-driven nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) in graphene-hBN moire superlattices, based on Lorentz skew scattering, achieves record-high conductivity and offers a new paradigm for NHE modulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tuning pathways for the nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) are inefficient and result in weak signals, limiting progress. This work aims to discover a more efficient and tunable route to achieving giant NHE signals.

Method: The study focuses on a graphene-hBN moire superlattice, utilizing a perpendicular magnetic field to induce Lorentz skew scattering (LSK), which generates a distinct type of NHE.

Result: The field-driven NHE exhibits a linear dependence on magnetic field and a pronounced unidirectional angular dependence, reaching up to 32% of the linear Hall signal. It follows a unique quartic scaling law and achieves a record-high nonlinear Hall conductivity (36000 μmV-1Ω-1) near van Hove singularities.

Conclusion: The discovery of a magnetic-field-driven nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) in graphene-hBN moire superlattices, originating from Lorentz skew scattering, demonstrates an efficient and tunable pathway for achieving giant Hall rectification. This breakthrough offers a new paradigm for modulating NHE beyond traditional electrostatic gating.

Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) can enable rectification and energy
harvesting, and its control by external fields, including gate, strain and
magnetic field, has been pursued intensively. However, existing tuning pathways
rely predominantly on fully quantum mechanical effects and are typically
inefficient, resulting in weak NHE signals that limit further progress. In this
work, we report the discovery of a distinct type of NHE in a graphene-hBN moire
superlattice, which arises from a classical-quantum cooperative effect called
Lorentz skew scattering (LSK), induced by a perpendicular magnetic field. This
field-driven NHE exhibits a linear dependence on magnetic field and a
pronounced unidirectional angular dependence. Remarkably, its magnitude reaches
up to 32% of the linear Hall signal. We show that this giant, field-tunable NHE
originating from LSK follows a unique quartic scaling law and produces a
record-high nonlinear Hall conductivity (36000 {\mu}mV-1{\Omega}-1) near van
Hove singularities of moire minibands, which is over an order of magnitude
larger than all previously reported NHEs. Our findings establish an efficient,
magnetic-field-driven route to giant Hall rectification in high-mobility
materials, offering a broadly applicable paradigm for modulating the NHE beyond
electrostatic gating.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore previously unobserved unscreened plasmon modes in plasmonic crystals and understand their behavior and potential applications.

Method: Experimental investigation of terahertz spectrum and development of an analytical model to describe the observed plasmonic excitations.

Result: Discovery of slot plasmons with square-root dispersion, unconventional wave-vector quantization, and persistence up to room temperature.

Conclusion: The study successfully identifies and characterizes unscreened slot plasmon modes in AlGaN/GaN 2DES, revealing their unique square-root dispersion and unconventional wave-vector quantization. The findings open new opportunities for plasmonic device applications.

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the terahertz spectrum of plasma excitations in
a plasmonic crystal based on AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron system (2DES).
While screened plasmon modes with linear dispersion are readily observed in the
plasmonic crystals, the existence of unscreened modes localized in the slots
between the gates has remained unobserved until now. We discover this slot
plasma excitation exhibiting square-root dispersion. It turned out that these
slot plasmons follow an unconventional wave-vector quantization rule, $q_u=(N +
1/4) \times \pi/l_u$ for even integers $N$, and require the condition for
excitation $q_u h \ll 1$, where $h$ is the gate-to-2DES distance and $l_u$ is
the slot width. We develop an analytical model that accurately captures the
found dispersion and relaxation, revealing a non-trivial $-\pi/4$ phase shift
upon plasmon reflection at the gate edge. Experiments demonstrate that the slot
plasmons persist up to room temperature, thereby enabling a broad range of
opportunities for the advancement of plasmonic devices.

*Hao Chen,Zhong-Ke Ding,Nannan Luo,Jiang Zeng,Li-Ming Tang,Ke-Qiu Chen*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A momentum compensation mechanism enables coherent negative refraction of phonons in heterostructures, advancing applications in phonon control and thermal management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negative refraction of coherent phonons is essential for thermal management and quantum information processing but has been unrealized due to challenges in achieving suitable dispersion with long-range coherence.

Method: The study utilizes a momentum compensation mechanism mediated by discrete translational symmetry and interfacial reciprocal lattice vectors. Non-equilibrium Green's function formalism is employed to demonstrate the negative refraction.

Result: The proposed mechanism successfully achieves negative refraction of isotropic acoustic phonons without requiring strong dispersion anisotropy or a negative-curvature band.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the realization of coherent negative refraction of isotropic acoustic phonons in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures through a momentum compensation mechanism, enabling active control of phonon flow and potential applications in phonon lenses and directional thermal transport.

Abstract: Negative refraction of coherent phonons is crucial for thermal management and
quantum information processing, but it remains unrealized because achieving the
suitable dispersion for negative refraction simultaneously with long-range
coherence is challenging. In this letter, we overcome this limitation by
introducing a momentum compensation mechanism mediated by discrete
translational symmetry. Interfacial reciprocal lattice vectors provide momentum
compensation during phonon tunneling and induce asymmetric mode matching,
resulting in negative refraction without requiring strong dispersion anisotropy
or a negative-curvature band. Using non-equilibrium Green's function formalism,
we demonstrate coherent negative refraction of isotropic acoustic phonons in
graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures. This general mechanism
enables active control of phonon flow via interfacial design, paving the way
for applications in atomic-scale phonon lenses and directional thermal
transport.

TL;DR: Shunting with a silver film neutralizes acoustoelectric domains, improving current stability and emission in InGaAs/GaAs heterostructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issues of current decrease, oscillations, and reduced band-to-band emission caused by acoustoelectric domain formation in strong electric fields.

Method: Deposition of a shunting semi-opaque silver film on the heterostructure surface between ohmic contacts.

Result: Shunting eliminated current decrease and significantly increased band-to-band emission intensity.

Conclusion: The shunting technique successfully neutralizes the acoustoelectric domain, preventing current decrease and enhancing band-to-band emission intensity in InGaAs/GaAs heterostructures.

Abstract: There has been experimentally implemented a technique of neutralization of an
acoustoelectric domain under the conditions of the lateral transport of charge
carriers in strong electric fields in the multilayer InGaAs/GaAs
heterostructures with quantum wells. The technique is implemented by means of
deposition of a shunting semi opaque silver film on the heterostructure surface
between the ohmic contacts. In absence of shunting the domain appearance leads
to current decrease, current oscillations and also to a strong decrease of the
band-to-band emission during a voltage pulse applied to the sample. The
shunting eliminated the current decrease and enabled it to strongly enlarge the
band-to-band emission intensity.

TL;DR: Electrical tunability of light-matter interactions in a terahertz resonator and 2D electron gas was achieved, with coupling strength adjustable from η=0.46 to η=0.18.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the electrical tunability of ultrastrong light-matter interactions in a terahertz circuit-based resonator and a two-dimensional electron gas, focusing on the effects of electric bias and magnetic fields.

Method: Transmission spectroscopy measurements under a strong magnetic field and varying electric gate biases were conducted to study the electrical tunability of light-matter interactions.

Result: The normalized coupling strength (η) was tuned from 0.46 to 0.18, demonstrating the excitation of standing plasma waves and effective tunability of electron numbers coupled to the resonator.

Conclusion: This study successfully demonstrates the in-situ tunability of the normalized coupling strength between a single terahertz resonator and a 2D electron gas, showcasing potential applications in terahertz far-field spectroscopy and quantum well heterostructures.

Abstract: We study the electrical tunability of ultrastrong light-matter interactions
between a single terahertz circuit-based complementary split ring resonator
(cSRR) and a two-dimensional electron gas. For this purpose, transmission
spectroscopy measurements are performed under the influence of a strong
magnetic field at different set points for the electric gate bias. The
resulting Landau polariton dispersion depends on the applied electric bias, as
the gating technique confines the electrons in-plane down to extremely
sub-wavelength dimensions as small as d = 410 nm. This confinement allows for
the excitation of standing plasma waves at zero magnetic field and an effective
tunability of the electron number coupled to the THz resonator. This allows the
normalized coupling strength to be tuned in-situ from $\eta$ = 0.46 down to
$\eta$ = 0.18. This is the first demonstration of terahertz far-field
spectroscopy of an electrically tunable interaction between a single terahertz
resonator and electrons in a GaAs quantum well heterostructure.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff
between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-K\"onig
bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend
topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford
hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D
Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We
construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries
represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal
non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes,
using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent
to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time
decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds
via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$
gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford
hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$
gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of
these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an
$O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose
a conjecture extending the Bravyi-K\"onig bound to Clifford hierarchy
stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions providing an upper bound of
spatial dimension $(N-1)$ for achieving the logical gates in the
$N^\text{th}$-level of Clifford hierarchy.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Proposes CLP-ZNE, an efficient error mitigation method for NISQ devices, reducing errors by leveraging cyclic layout permutations and demonstrating applicability to real hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the utility of NISQ devices by mitigating hardware errors efficiently, considering constraints like limited qubits and connectivity.

Method: The method utilizes cyclic layout permutations (CLP) to average over gate errors, leveraging non-uniformity of errors and symmetries in quantum circuits with one-dimensional connectivity, requiring only O(n) measurements for n qubit circuits.

Result: Benchmarked against IBM Torino quantum computer noise models, CLP-ZNE reduces expectation value errors by an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: CLP-ZNE protocol demonstrates significant error reduction in NISQ devices and shows promise for applicability in present-day quantum processors.

Abstract: Increasing the utility of currently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) devices requires developing efficient methods to mitigate
hardware errors, taking into account the constraints of these devices such as
medium number of qubits and limited connectivity between them. In this work we
propose a novel Cyclic Layout Permutations based Zero Noise Extrapolation
(CLP-ZNE) protocol for such a task. The method leverages the inherent
non-uniformity of gate errors in NISQ hardware and exploits symmetries of
quantum circuits with one-dimensional connectivity to extrapolate the
expectation value, averaged over cyclic circuit layout permutations, to the
level of zero noise. In contrast to the previous layout permutation based
approaches, for $n$ qubit circuit CLP-ZNE requires measurements of only $O(n)$
different circuit layouts to reconstruct the noiseless expected value. When
benchmarked against noise channels modeling the IBM Torino quantum computer,
the method reduces a typical expectation value error by an order of magnitude,
depending on the protocol specifications. By employing a noise model derived
from real hardware specifications, including both depolarizing and $T_1/T_2$
relaxation processes, these results give evidence for the applicability of
CLP-ZNE to present-day NISQ processors.

Result: 提出的方法在Z_2格点规范理论中显著降低了样本复杂度，尽管电路复杂度有所增加。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了三种针对具有局域（或规范）对称性的系统的经典阴影协议，显著提高了预测规范不变可观测量的效率，尤其在格点规范理论模型中表现出色。尽管增加了电路复杂度，但样本效率的提升是显著的。

Abstract: Classical shadows provide a versatile framework for estimating many
properties of quantum states from repeated, randomly chosen measurements
without requiring full quantum state tomography. When prior information is
available, such as knowledge of symmetries of states and operators, this
knowledge can be exploited to significantly improve sample efficiency. In this
work, we develop three classical shadow protocols tailored to systems with
local (or gauge) symmetries to enable efficient prediction of gauge-invariant
observables in lattice gauge theory models which are currently at the forefront
of quantum simulation efforts. For such models, our approaches can offer
exponential improvements in sample complexity over symmetry-agnostic methods,
albeit at the cost of increased circuit complexity. We demonstrate these
trade-offs using a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory, where a dual
formulation enables a rigorous analysis of resource requirements, including
both circuit depth and sample complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a robust method to analyze quantum systems, especially in the presence of statistical noise from finite experiment repetitions.

Method: Stabilized analytic continuation (SAC) is developed to extract non-polynomial analytic functions of density matrices in randomized measurement experiments.

Result: Successful application of SAC to estimate von Neumann entanglement entropy from simulated and experimental Rényi entropy data.

Conclusion: The SAC framework is shown to be robust against statistical noise and is generalizable for extracting various nonlinear quantum diagnostics.

Abstract: We develop a framework for extracting non-polynomial analytic functions of
density matrices in randomized measurement experiments by a method of
analytical continuation. A central advantage of this approach, dubbed
stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise
arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited
to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the
von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched N\'eel
state from R\'enyi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol.
We then apply the method to experimental R\'enyi data from a trapped-ion
quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different
evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily
generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic
negativity and R\'enyi relative entropies.

Abstract: Correlation self-testing of quantum theory involves identifying a task or set
of tasks whose optimal performance can be achieved only by theories that can
realise the same set of correlations as quantum theory in every causal
structure. Following this approach, previous work has ruled out various classes
of generalised probabilistic theories whose joint state spaces have a certain
regularity in the sense of a (discrete) rotation symmetry of the bipartite
state spaces. Here we consider theories whose bipartite state spaces lack this
regularity. We form them by taking the convex hull of all the local states and
a finite number of non-local states. We show that a criterion of compositional
consistency is needed in such theories: for a measurement effect to be valid,
there must exist at least one measurement that it is part of. This goes beyond
previous consistency criteria and corresponds to a strengthening of the
no-restriction hypothesis. We show that quantum theory outperforms these
theories in a task called the adaptive CHSH game, which shows that they can be
ruled out experimentally. We further show a connection between compositional
consistency and Tsirelson's bound.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine how much entanglement can be created in the process of particle scattering, specifically addressing the limitations of the standard plane-wave description and the role of quantum uncertainty.

Method: The paper employs fully coherent calculations of bipartite scattering in three-dimensional space, quantifying entanglement by the inverse of the single particle purity. It contrasts the standard plane-wave description with a more realistic approach considering quantum uncertainty in the initial state.

Result: For realistic scattering setups with narrow initial momentum dispersion, entanglement scales linearly with the scattering cross section and is strongly enhanced near shape resonances. The study also discusses experimental detection of motional entanglement.

Conclusion: The study opens the way to probing and utilizing entanglement in quantum collisions, highlighting its potential applications in experimental settings.

Abstract: Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen discussed their paradox in terms of measuring
the positions or momenta of two particles. These can become entangled upon
scattering, but how much entanglement can be created in this process? Here we
address this question with fully coherent calculations of bipartite scattering
in three-dimensional space, quantifying entanglement by the inverse of the
single particle purity. We show that the standard plane-wave description of
scattering fails to capture the entanglement properties, due to the essential
role of quantum uncertainty in the initial state. For a more realistic
description of a scattering setup and narrow initial momentum dispersion, we
find the entanglement to scale linearly with the scattering cross section,
including strong enhancement close to shape resonances. We discuss how the
generation of motional entanglement can be detected in experiments. Our results
open the way to probing and eventually using entanglement in quantum
collisions.

Motivation: To improve the performance of tensor-network-based optimization algorithms by addressing non-local qubit interactions and leveraging problem structure.

Method: The paper proposes a quantum-inspired combinatorial solver using imaginary-time evolution (ITE) on a matrix product state (MPS) with non-local couplings via structured SWAP networks and spectral qubit mapping.

Result: A 20× reduction in error was achieved with spectral ordering and triangular SWAP networks, and spectral qubit ordering improved both solution quality and entanglement entropy during optimization.

Conclusion: Exploiting problem structure through spectral mapping and efficient routing networks significantly enhances the performance of tensor-network-based optimization algorithms.

Abstract: We propose a quantum-inspired combinatorial solver that performs
imaginary-time evolution (ITE) on a matrix product state (MPS), incorporating
non-local couplings through structured SWAP networks and spectral qubit mapping
of logical qubits. The SWAP networks, composed exclusively of local two-qubit
gates, effectively mediate non-local qubit interactions. We investigate two
distinct network architectures based on rectangular and triangular meshes of
SWAP gates and analyze their performance in combination with spectral qubit
ordering, which maps logical qubits to MPS sites based on the Laplacian of the
logical qubit connectivity graph. The proposed framework is evaluated on
synthetic MaxCut instances with varying graph connectivity, as well as on a
dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on real historical asset data
involving 180 qubits. On certain problem configurations, we observe an over
20$\times$ reduction in error when combining spectral ordering and triangular
SWAP networks compared to optimization with shuffled qubit ordering.
Furthermore, an analysis of the entanglement entropy during portfolio
optimization reveals that spectral qubit ordering not only improves solution
quality but also enhances the total and spatially distributed entanglement
within the MPS. These findings demonstrate that exploiting problem structure
through spectral mapping and efficient routing networks can substantially
enhance the performance of tensor-network-based optimization algorithms.

Abstract: This paper introduces D2-UC, a quantum-ready framework for the unit
commitment (UC) problem that prepares UC for near-term hybrid quantum-classical
solvers by combining distributed classical decomposition with distributed
quantum execution. We reformulate deterministic and stochastic UC into a
three-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM): (i) a convex
quadratic subproblem for dispatch and reserves, (ii) a binary subproblem
expressed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), and (iii) a
proximal slack update for consensus. The core contributions are fivefold.
First, we demonstrate how the full UC problem can be expressed as a single
monolithic QUBO, establishing a direct interface to quantum solvers. Second, we
decompose this large binary block into three type-specific QUBOs for
commitment, startup, and shutdown, making the problem more tractable but
revealing slower ADMM convergence. Third, we restore local logical couplings
through per-unit-time micro-QUBOs, which accelerate convergence. Fourth, we
batch micro-QUBOs into K non-overlapping block-diagonal problems, reducing many
subproblems to a fixed number of solver-ready QUBOs per iteration, compatible
with distributed variational quantum eigensolvers (DVQE). Fifth, we integrate
an accept-if-better safeguard with DVQE to stabilize hybrid updates and prevent
oscillations. Case studies confirm that the proposed methods deliver feasible
schedules, faster convergence, and QUBO sizes aligned with current and
near-term quantum hardware capabilities. All detailed data, codes, and

Abstract: First-passage phenomena play a fundamental role in classical stochastic

quantum diffusion driven by measurement noise, a generalization of classical
Brownian motion. Such continuous monitoring may trap the measured quantum
system in a decoherence-free subspace, a fraction of the available state space
that is isolated from the surroundings, and thus plays an important role in
quantum information science. We analytically determine the first-passage time
distribution, whose form neither depends on the system Hamiltonian nor on the
measurement operator, and is therefore universal. These results provide a
general framework to investigate the first-passage statistics of diffusive
quantum trajectories.

Motivation: To enable high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates for digital quantum algorithms and error-corrected quantum computers, eliminating the need for qubit frequency tunability.

Method: Theoretical framework utilizing frequency- and amplitude-modulated microwave control, analyzed and designed using Floquet theory to optimize fidelity and applicability.

Result: Successful demonstration of a universal gate set (X, Hadamard, phase, and CZ gates) with control errors below 0.1% and practical gate times (25-40 ns for single-qubit, 125-135 ns for two-qubit).

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates high-fidelity quantum gates using frequency- and amplitude-modulated microwave control, achieving control errors below 0.1% for universal gate sets, with practical gate times.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates is essential for
executing arbitrary digital quantum algorithms and for building error-corrected
quantum computers. We propose a theoretical framework for implementing quantum
gates using frequency- and amplitude-modulated microwave control, which extends
conventional amplitude modulation by introducing frequency modulation as an
additional degree of control. Our approach operates on fixed-frequency qubits,
converting the need for qubit frequency tunability into drive frequency
modulation. Using Floquet theory, we analyze and design these drives for
optimal fidelity within specified criteria. Our framework spans adiabatic to
nonadiabatic gates within the Floquet framework, ensuring broad applicability
across gate types and control schemes. Using typical transmon qubit parameters
in numerical simulations, we demonstrate a universal gate set-including the X,
Hadamard, phase, and CZ gates-with control error well below 0.1% and gate times
of 25-40 ns for single-qubit operations and 125-135 ns for two-qubit
operations. Furthermore, we show an always-on CZ gate tailored for driven
qubits, which has gate times of 80-90 ns.

TL;DR: The paper studies how non-reciprocal tunneling in the Hatano-Nelson lattice affects the dynamics of two bosons, revealing asymmetric structures and Bloch oscillations, and suggests applications in quantum sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the interplay of interactions and non-Hermiticity in quantum systems, particularly focusing on the dynamics of bosons in non-reciprocal tunneling scenarios.

Method: Theoretical investigation of the dynamics of two bosons on a one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson lattice with non-reciprocal tunneling, analyzing the effects of non-Hermiticity, interactions, and external forces.

Result: The system forms asymmetric density cones under non-reciprocal tunneling, exhibits asymmetric two-particle Bloch oscillations under an external force, and shows non-reciprocal bunching or anti-bunching depending on interaction strength. The Quantum Fisher Information grows as a power law, indicating potential use in quantum sensing.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the Hatano-Nelson lattice with non-reciprocal tunneling exhibits unique dynamical behaviors, including asymmetric density cones and two-particle Bloch oscillations, which can be tuned by non-reciprocity and interactions. The system also shows potential as a quantum-enhanced sensor for weak force detection.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the interplay of interactions and
non-Hermiticity in the dynamics of two bosons on the one-dimensional
Hatano-Nelson lattice with non-reciprocal tunneling. We find that the
non-reciprocity in the tunneling leads to the formation of an asymmetric
density cone during the time-evolution of the system; the degree of asymmetry
can be tuned by tuning the non-reciprocity parameter, $\delta$. Next, we
analyze the dynamics of this system in the presence of a static external force
and demonstrate that non-Hermiticity leads to asymmetric two-particle Bloch
oscillations. Interestingly, when $F=0$ ($F \ne 0$), strong interactions leads
to the formation of an inner density-cone (density-hourglass) structure; this
inner structure also becomes asymmetric in the presence of non-Hermiticity. We
further analyze the spatial correlations and establish that the system exhibits
non-reciprocal bunching (anti-bunching) in the presence of weak (strong)
interactions. Finally, we examine the growth of the Quantum Fisher Information,
$F_Q$, with time, and demonstrate that $F_Q \propto t^{\alpha}$ where $\alpha
\sim 3$. This feature persists for both one- and two-particle walks, thereby
demonstrating that this system can be employed as a quantum-enhanced sensor for
detecting weak forces.

*L. Theerthagiri,Balakrishnan Viswanathan,C. M. Chandrashekar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates thermal noise effects in the ZWM interferometer and proposes solutions (attenuation, three-SPDC, heralded detection) to restore interference visibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate the impact of thermal background noise on the interference visibility in the ZWM interferometer, which is crucial for practical applications of induced-coherence interferometry.

Method: The paper analyzes the interference visibility in the ZWM interferometer under low- and high-gain regimes, including the effects of thermal background noise. Solutions like optimal attenuation, a three-SPDC configuration, and heralded detection are proposed and tested.

Result: Thermal photons introduce an incoherent offset that reduces interference contrast. The visibility can be restored through optimal attenuation, a three-SPDC setup, or heralded detection, which effectively removes the noise.

Conclusion: The study highlights methods to restore interference visibility in the ZWM interferometer despite thermal background noise, including optimal attenuation, a three-SPDC configuration, and heralded detection.

Abstract: Induced-coherence interferometry, first introduced in the Zou-Wang-Mandel
(ZWM) setup, enables retrieval of object information from the interference
pattern of light that never interacted with the object. This scheme relies on
two identically correlated photon pairs and the absence of "which-way"
information about the photons illuminating the object to induce coherence in
their companions. In previous studies, the effect of thermal background on the
ZWM interferometer was considered; here we explicitly include background noise
and analyze the interference visibility in both low- and high-gain regimes,
revealing how thermal photons introduce an incoherent offset that lowers the
observed interference contrast. We show that the visibility can be restored
either by optimal attenuation or by extending the geometry to a three-SPDC
configuration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that introducing heralded detection
removes the detrimental effect of thermal background noise, restoring
high-contrast interference fringes.

TL;DR: Using NV centers in diamond, researchers probed CuPc spin dynamics, confirming electron-electron interactions drive decoherence at room temperature. The method also precisely measures NV depth, aiding molecular spin system applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular spin systems are promising for quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing, but their characterization at room temperature is challenging due to fast spin decoherence. This work aims to address this challenge.

Method: The researchers used $T_1$ relaxometry of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to probe the electron spin ensemble of a polycrystalline copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) thin film. They identified the NV-CuPc interaction through its hyperfine spectrum and extracted key parameters of the CuPc spin ensemble.

Conclusion: The study establishes nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as effective probes for molecular spin systems, offering insights into molecular qubits, spin bath engineering, and hybrid quantum materials. It also highlights potential applications in molecular-scale quantum processors and spin-based quantum networks.

Abstract: Molecular spin systems are promising candidates for quantum information
processing and nanoscale sensing, yet their characterization at room
temperature remains challenging due to fast spin decoherence. In this work, we
use $T_1$ relaxometry of shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond to
probe the electron spin ensemble of a polycrystalline copper phthalocyanine
(CuPc) thin film. In addition to unequivocally identifying the NV-CuPc
interaction thanks to its hyperfine spectrum, we further extract key parameters
of the CuPc spin ensemble, including its correlation time and local lattice
orientation, that cannot be measured in bulk electron resonance experiments.
The analysis of our experimental results confirms that electron-electron
interactions dominate the decoherence dynamics of CuPc at room temperature.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the CuPc-enhanced NV relaxometry can serve as
a robust method to estimate the NV depth with $\sim1$~nm precision. Our results
establish NV centers as powerful probes for molecular spin systems, providing
insights into molecular qubits, spin bath engineering, and hybrid quantum
materials, and offering a potential pathway toward their applications such as
molecular-scale quantum processors and spin-based quantum networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigation of quantum properties of superpositions of oppositely squeezed states (Schrödinger cat states) compared to conventional coherent-state cat states.

Method: Analysis of Wigner function, entanglement quantification when injected into a 50:50 beam splitter, and proposing a linear-optical heralding scheme.

Result: These states exhibit distinct photon-number structures, enhanced nonclassical features, and higher entanglement for small squeezing parameters compared to pure two-mode squeezed vacuum states.

Conclusion: Superpositions of oppositely squeezed states are promising resources for continuous-variable quantum information processing, particularly in regimes requiring high non-Gaussianity and strong entanglement.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of superpositions of oppositely
squeezed states, which can be regarded as Schrodinger cat states. Compared with
conventional coherent-state cat states, these states exhibit distinct
photon-number structures and enhanced nonclassical features. We analyze their
Wigner function and quantify the entanglement generated when they are injected
into a 50:50 beam splitter. For small squeezing parameters, the resulting
two-mode states possess higher entanglement than pure two-mode squeezed vacuum
states. We also propose a linear-optical heralding scheme that approximates
this superposition of oppositely squeezed states without requiring strong Kerr
nonlinearities. Our results indicate that such states are promising resources
for continuous-variable quantum information processing, particularly in regimes
where high non-Gaussianity and strong entanglement are desirable.

*Yuan Qiu,Ke-Xiong Yan,Jun-Hao Lin,Jie Song,Ye-Hong Chen,Yan-Xia*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the superradiant phase transition in the anisotropic Rabi model using the pattern picture and a parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model, revealing critical behaviors at the transition point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the mechanism of the superradiant phase transition in the anisotropic Rabi model under the classical oscillator limit, particularly due to the difficulty in achieving this limit.

Method: The study used the pattern picture to expand the anisotropic Rabi model Hamiltonian in operator space, identifying three patterns. The quantum phase transition was investigated within a parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model.

Result: The phase transition arises from competition between patterns. The parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model reproduces the dynamics of an ultrastrong-coupling anisotropic Rabi model, showing vanishing excitation energy and infinite photon number at the critical point.

Conclusion: The system undergoes a superradiant phase transition at the critical point, as evidenced by the vanishing excitation energy and infinite photon number beyond the critical point.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we analyze the mechanism of the superradiant phase
transition in the anisotropic Rabi model under the classical oscillator limit
using the pattern picture. By expanding the anisotropic Rabi model Hamiltonian
in operator space, we obtained three patterns, and we find that the phase
transition arises from the competition between patterns. The difficulty in
achieving the classical oscillator limit motivates our investigation into the
quantum phase transition within a parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model.
This parametrically-driven Jaynes-Cummings model can reproduce the dynamics of
a ultrastrong-coupling anisotropic Rabi model in a squeezed-light frame.
According to the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the normal and superradiant
phases of this equivalent anisotropic Rabi model, we find that the excitation
energy of the normal phase and the superradiant phase vanishes at the critical
point. The photon number becomes infinite beyond the critical point. These
results indicate that the system undergoes a superradiant phase transition at
the critical point.

*Kenta Sawamura,Kensuke Araki,Naoki Maruyama,Renichiro Haba,Masayuki Ohzeki*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical algorithm improves efficiency and solution quality in multi-objective production planning by decomposing the problem and using tailored solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in solving large-scale production planning problems and conflicting objectives in practical scenarios, which make traditional scalarization techniques ineffective.

Method: A quantum-classical hybrid algorithm decomposes the problem into resource allocation (solved using annealing-based methods) and task scheduling (solved using conventional solvers).

Result: Experimental results show the hybrid approach achieves better solution quality and computational efficiency compared to traditional monolithic methods.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum-classical hybrid algorithm demonstrates superior solution quality and computational efficiency, offering a promising direction for high-speed, multi-objective scheduling in industrial applications.

Abstract: Efficient production planning is essential in modern manufacturing to improve
performance indicators such as lead time and to reduce reliance on human
intuition. While mathematical optimization approaches, formulated as job shop
scheduling problems, have been applied to automate this process, solving
large-scale production planning problems remains computationally demanding.
Moreover, many practical scenarios involve conflicting objectives, making
traditional scalarization techniques ineffective in finding diverse and useful
Pareto-optimal solutions. To address these challenges, we developed a
quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that decomposes the problem into two
subproblems: resource allocation and task scheduling. Resource allocation is
formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem and solved
using annealing-based methods that efficiently explore complex solutions. Task
scheduling is modeled as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and solved
using conventional solvers to satisfy detailed scheduling constraints. We
validated the proposed method using benchmark instances based on foundry
production scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
achieves superior solution quality and computational efficiency compared to
traditional monolithic methods. This work offers a promising direction for
high-speed, multi-objective scheduling in industrial applications.

### [35] [Thermodynamic Probes of Multipartite Entanglement in Strongly Interacting Quantum Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03266)
*Harsh Sharma,Sampriti Saha,A. S. Majumdar,Manik Banik,Himadri Shekhar Dhar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: ✍️ **TL;DR**
The paper introduces a method to measure multipartite entanglement in quantum systems with strong interactions, bypassing traditional thermodynamic limitations. It works via controlled quenching or local observables and is validated on several models, showing promise for near-term quantum simulators.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 💡 **Motivation**
Current entanglement measures based on thermodynamic quantities (e.g., ergotropy) are operationally accessible but restrictive for systems with strong interactions. Advances in quantum simulators motivate the development of a more versatile framework to quantify multipartite entanglement in such systems.


Method: 🔧 **Method**
The framework evaluates global and local ergotropy through controlled quenching of interactions or measurement of local observables. It avoids the restrictions of traditional ergotropy-based measures, particularly in systems with strong collective or interparticle interactions. The methodology is validated on stationary and time-evolved states, including simulations on quantum circuits with varying noise levels and depths.


Result: 📊 **Result**
The proposed framework successfully quantifies genuine multipartite entanglement in systems with strong interactions, including the Tavis-Cummings model, the three-level Dicke model, and the transverse-field Ising model. It proves robust against circuit depth and noise in quantum simulations.


Conclusion: 📌 **Conclusion**
The study presents a novel framework for quantifying multipartite entanglement in quantum many-body systems, addressing limitations of existing measures based on thermodynamic quantities like ergotropy. By leveraging controlled quenching of interactions or local observables, the framework accurately estimates entanglement in systems with strong interactions, as demonstrated in several physical models. This approach holds promise for advancing entanglement characterization in near-term quantum simulators.


Abstract: Quantifying multipartite entanglement in quantum many-body systems and hybrid
quantum computing architectures is a fundamental yet challenging task. In
recent years, thermodynamic quantities such as the maximum extractable work
from an isolated system (the ergotropy) have allowed for entanglement measures
that are operationally more accessible. However, these measures can be
restrictive when applied to systems governed by Hamiltonians with strong
collective or interparticle interactions. Motivated by advances in quantum
simulators, we propose a framework that circumvents these restrictions by
evaluating global and local ergotropy either through controlled quenching of
interactions or by measuring suitable local observables only. We show that this
formalism allows us to correctly estimate genuine multipartite entanglement in
both stationary and time-evolved states of systems with strong interactions,
including parametrized quantum states simulated on a quantum circuit with
varying circuit depth and noise. We demonstrate its applicability to realistic
physical models, namely, the Tavis-Cummings model, the three-level Dicke model,
and the transverse-field Ising model, highlighting its potential as a versatile
tool for characterizing entanglement in near-term quantum simulators.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Data dimensionality reduction in QML skews performance metrics, with accuracy differences up to 48%, influenced by dataset and model factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the constraints of NISQ quantum devices (noise and limited qubits) and the challenge of simulating large qubit numbers on classical devices, while assessing the scalability of dimensionality reduction in QML.

Method: Experimentation with generated datasets, quantum machine algorithms, quantum data encoding methods, and data reduction methods, evaluated on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Result: Data reduction methods lead to skewed performance metrics, with accuracy differences of 14% to 48%. Some methods perform better with specific data embedding and ansatz constructions.

Conclusion: Data dimensionality reduction methods skew performance metrics in Quantum Machine Learning models, leading to inaccurate performance estimation. Factors like dataset characteristics, quantum information embedding methods, and model structure exacerbate this issue, with accuracy differences ranging from 14% to 48%.

Abstract: Data dimensionality reduction techniques are often utilized in the
implementation of Quantum Machine Learning models to address two significant
issues: the constraints of NISQ quantum devices, which are characterized by
noise and a limited number of qubits, and the challenge of simulating a large
number of qubits on classical devices. It also raises concerns over the
scalability of these approaches, as dimensionality reduction methods are slow
to adapt to large datasets. In this article, we analyze how data reduction
methods affect different QML models. We conduct this experiment over several
generated datasets, quantum machine algorithms, quantum data encoding methods,
and data reduction methods. All these models were evaluated on the performance
metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our findings have led
us to conclude that the usage of data dimensionality reduction methods results
in skewed performance metric values, which results in wrongly estimating the
actual performance of quantum machine learning models. There are several
factors, along with data dimensionality reduction methods, that worsen this
problem, such as characteristics of the datasets, classical to quantum
information embedding methods, percentage of feature reduction, classical
components associated with quantum models, and structure of quantum machine
learning models. We consistently observed the difference in the accuracy range
of 14% to 48% amongst these models, using data reduction and not using it.
Apart from this, our observations have shown that some data reduction methods
tend to perform better for some specific data embedding methodologies and
ansatz constructions.

### [37] [Exploring Topologies in Quantum Annealing: A Hardware-Aware Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03327)
*Mario Bifulco,Luca Roversi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how quantum hardware topology affects problem embedding in QA, finding Havel-Hakimi topologies more efficient than Zephyr for embedding optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum Annealing (QA) is constrained by the topology of quantum hardware, leading to inefficient compilations. The study aims to assess how hardware topology negatively impacts embedded problems and makes quantum optimization more sensitive to noise.

Method: The study evaluates Minor Embedding (ME) across two QPU topologies: Zephyr graphs (used in current D-Wave systems) and Havel-Hakimi graphs. ME is executed on classical architectures to analyze how hardware topology affects the embedded problem.

Result: Findings suggest Havel-Hakimi-based topologies require shorter qubit chains and exhibit better scaling of embeddable problem graphs compared to Zephyr graphs.

Conclusion: Havel-Hakimi-based topologies, on average, require shorter qubit chains in the minor of the problem graph, showing smoother scaling of the largest embeddable problem graph as QPU size increases. This suggests their potential as alternative designs for QA-based QPUs.

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) offers a promising framework for solving NP-hard
optimization problems, but its effectiveness is constrained by the topology of
the underlying quantum hardware. Solving an optimization problem $P$ via QA
involves a hardware-aware circuit compilation which requires representing $P$
as a graph $G_P$ and embedding it into the hardware connectivity graph $G_Q$
that defines how qubits connect to each other in a QA-based quantum processing
unit (QPU).
  Minor Embedding (ME) is a possible operational form of this hardware-aware
compilation. ME heuristically builds a map that associates each node of $G_P$
-- the logical variables of $P$ -- to a chain of adjacent nodes in $G_Q$ by
means of one of its minors, so that the arcs of $G_P$ are preserved as physical
connections among qubits in $G_Q$.
  The static topology of hardwired qubits can clearly lead to inefficient
compilations because $G_Q$ cannot be a clique, currently. We propose a
methodology and a set of criteria to evaluate how the hardware topology $G_Q$
can negatively affect the embedded problem, thus making the quantum
optimization more sensible to noise.
  We evaluate the result of ME across two QPU topologies: Zephyr graphs (used
in current D-Wave systems) and Havel-Hakimi graphs, which allow controlled
variation of the average node degree. This enables us to study how the ratio
`number of nodes/number of incident arcs per node' affects ME success rates to
map $G_P$ into a minor of $G_Q$.
  Our findings, obtained through ME executed on classical, i.e. non-quantum,
architectures, suggest that Havel-Hakimi-based topologies, on average, require
shorter qubit chains in the minor of $G_P$, exhibiting smoother scaling of the
largest embeddable $G_P$ as the QPU size increases. These characteristics
indicate their potential as alternative designs for QA-based QPUs.

Result: 不连续性的出现取决于弱值的虚部，临界指数为1，与系统参数无关

Conclusion: 揭示了量子弱测量协议中后选择角度的临界现象，并展示了控制测量反作用力以塑造量子动力学的新方法

Abstract: Critical phenomena reveal universal behavior in complex systems, and
uncovering analogous effects in quantum weak measurement protocols with
post-selection provides new insight into how measurement backaction can shape
quantum dynamics. This work investigates dynamical discontinuities that arise
when the post-selected polar angle is used as a control parameter. The system
evolves under repeated applications of a weak measurement protocol with
post-selection, in which the meter state is retained after each iteration while
the system is renewed. The emergence of these discontinuities is shown to be
determined by the structure of the weak value: when the weak value has a
nonzero imaginary component, a discontinuity appears in the expectation value
of meter observables precisely at the point where the imaginary part of the
weak value vanishes as a function of the post-selection polar angle. In
contrast, no discontinuities occur when the weak value remains real for all
post-selection angles. The phenomenon originates from the eigenstructure of the
protocol's Kraus operator, with the stability of fixed points changing at the
critical point where the discontinuity arises. Remarkably, the associated
critical exponent is 1, independent of system parameters. These results open
new perspectives for engineering non-analytic behavior in measurement-based
quantum control and for probing criticality in post-selected quantum dynamics
using weak measurements with weak values.

result in an 11.4-fold speedup over the previous 48-qubit record on the K

Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of precise control over emitter positioning relative to plasmonic nanostructures for enhanced quantum emitter and sensing applications.

Method: The method involves using gold nano-bipyramids (BPs) as plasmonic nanocavities and employing plasmon-triggered two-photon polymerization to localize quantum dots at a single hotspot.

Result: The results show Rabi splitting of 349.3 meV and a coupling strength of 175.68 meV, with confirmed anti-crossing behavior, indicating successful strong coupling.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates a scalable platform for achieving strong coupling between quantum dots and plasmonic nanostructures at room temperature, facilitating advancements in quantum optics and sensing applications.

Abstract: Achieving strong coupling between excitons of colloidal semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs) and localized surface plasmon polaritons (LSPs) is critical for
advanced room-temperature quantum emitter and sensing applications. A key
challenge is to have precise control of the emitters position with respect to
an individual plasmonic nanostructure. Here, we present room temperature strong
coupling between QDs and a single gold nano-bipyramid (BPs). The selection of
the bipyramid plasmonic nanocavity offers access to a single hotspot with a
very small mode volume. The localization of QDs at a single hotspot is achieved
via plasmon-triggered two-photon polymerization. This technique exploits the
enhanced electric field at the BP tip to selectively polymerize a
photosensitive QD-containing formulation. Room-temperature scattering spectra
of a 3-QD-BP system reveal Rabi splitting of 349.3 meV and a coupling strength
of 175.68 meV. The with distinct anti-crossing behavior is confirmed by
simulations. This approach simplifies QD integration for strong coupling
systems compared to previous methods. These results indicate a scalable
platform for solid-state quantum technologies with colloidal QDs, enabling
explora-tion of exciton-plasmon interactions and further advance-ment of
applications in quantum optics and quantum sensing under ambient conditions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a significant improvement in chiral discrimination using quantum-elevated chiral probes, achieving a 5 dB improvement beyond the shot-noise limit. This non-destructive, biocompatible protocol has broad implications for various fields.

Abstract: Chiral discrimination of enantiomeric biomolecules is vital in chemistry,
biology, and medicine. Conventional methods, relying on circularly polarized
light, face weak chiroptical signals and potential photodamage. Despite
extensive efforts to improve sensitivity under low-photon exposure, classical
chiral probes remain fundamentally bounded by the shot-noise limit due to
quantum fluctuations. To beat these limitations, we demonstrate
quantum-elevated chiral discrimination using continuous-variable
polarization-entangled states as moderate-photon-flux, high-sensitivity,
quantum-noise-squeezed chiral probes. We achieve a 5 dB improvement beyond the
SNL in distinguishing L- and D-amino acids in liquid phase. This
non-destructive, biocompatible protocol enables high-sensitivity chiral
analysis, with broad implications for drug development, biochemical research,
environmental monitoring, and asymmetric synthesis.

Conclusion: 量子力学作为Fisher正则化信息流体动力学的一个可逆固定点出现，通过我们的公理体系证明其唯一性。

Abstract: We pose the converse Madelung question: not whether Fisher information can
reproduce quantum mechanics, but whether it is necessary. We work with minimal,
physically motivated axioms on density and phase: locality, probability
conservation, Euclidean invariance with a global phase symmetry, reversibility,
and convex regularity. Within the resulting class of first order local
Hamiltonian field theories, these axioms single out the canonical Poisson
bracket on density and phase under the Dubrovin and Novikov assumptions for
local hydrodynamic brackets. Using a pointwise, gauge covariant complex change
of variables that maps density and phase to a single complex field, we show
that the only convex, rotationally invariant, first derivative local functional
of the density whose Euler Lagrange term yields a reversible completion that is
exactly projectively linear is the Fisher functional. When its coefficient
equals Planck constant squared divided by twice the mass, the dynamics reduce
to the linear Schrodinger equation. For many body systems, a single local
complex structure across sectors enforces the same relation species by species,
fixing a single Planck constant. Galilean covariance appears through the
Bargmann central extension, with the usual superselection consequences.
Comparison with the Doebner and Goldin family identifies the reversible zero
diffusion corner with linear Schrodinger dynamics. We provide operational
falsifiers via residual diagnostics for the continuity and Hamilton Jacobi
equations and report numerical minima at the Fisher scale that are invariant
under Galilean boosts. In this setting, quantum mechanics emerges as a
reversible fixed point of Fisher regularised information hydrodynamics. A code
archive enables direct numerical checks, including a superposition stress test
that preserves exact projective linearity within our axioms.

Motivation: Error mitigation is crucial for practical quantum algorithm implementation on NISQ devices. The study aims to enhance CDR for better noise mitigation in quantum chemistry simulations.

Method: The research involved noisy simulations of the H₄ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz using the ibm torino noise model. It analyzed hyperparameters in CDR and introduced ES (selecting lowest-energy training circuits) and NCE (including non-Clifford parameters as input).

Result: Both proposed strategies, ES and NCE, demonstrated superior performance compared to the original CDR in mitigating noise.

Conclusion: The study proposes two improvements to the Clifford Data Regression (CDR) framework, Energy Sampling (ES) and Non-Clifford Extrapolation (NCE), both of which outperform the original CDR in mitigating noise for quantum chemistry simulations using VQE.

Abstract: Error mitigation is essential for the practical implementation of quantum
algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work
explores and extends Clifford Data Regression (CDR) to mitigate noise in
quantum chemistry simulations using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).
Using the H$_4$ molecule with the tiled Unitary Product State (tUPS) ansatz, we
perform noisy simulations with the ibm torino noise model to investigate in
detail the effect of various hyperparameters in CDR on the error mitigation
quality. Building on these insights, two improvements to the CDR framework are
proposed. The first, Energy Sampling (ES), improves performance by selecting
only the lowest-energy training circuits for regression, thereby further
biasing the sample energies toward the target state. The second, Non-Clifford
Extrapolation (NCE), enhances the regression model by including the number of
non-Clifford parameters as an additional input, enabling the model to learn how
the noisy-ideal mapping evolves as the circuit approaches the optimal one. Our
numerical results demonstrate that both strategies outperform the original CDR.

*Hyunwoo Choi,Jisang Seo,Weng C. Chew,Dong-Yeop Na*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A numerical framework integrates quantum emitter dynamics into classical electromagnetic solvers (FDTD/FEM) via Greens function reconstruction for open, dissipative systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend computational electromagnetic solvers to model single photon emission in open and dissipative systems beyond the Markovian approximation.

Method: A numerical framework using modal expansion in three dimensions to reconstruct the dyadic Greens function and integrate it into FDTD and FEM solvers.

Result: Demonstrated the framework's applicability via numerical verification with a lossy Lorentz Drude mirror and a Fabry Perot cavity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a Greens function based approach for quantum emitter dynamics in computational electromagnetics, bridging classical solvers with quantum light-matter interactions.

Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical framework for modeling single photon
emission from a two level system in open and dissipative systems beyond the
Markovian approximation. The method can be readily integrated into standard
computational electromagnetic (CEM) solvers such as finite difference time
domain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM). We numerically verify the
completeness of boundary and medium assisted modes in the modified Langevin
noise formalism by reconstructing the imaginary part of the dyadic Greens
function through modal expansion in three dimensions. This reconstruction
enables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi
mode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the
single excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level
system is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying
that radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework
thus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population
and single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers. We then
present concrete strategies for implementing our method in both FDTD and FEM
frameworks, demonstrating its practical applicability. We further verify
numerical results for a lossy Lorentz Drude type mirror, including both the
case of a TLS near a finite sized metallic mirror and that of a TLS centered in
a Fabry Perot cavity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for
incorporating quantum emitter dynamics into computational electromagnetics,
thereby extending classical solvers toward quantum light matter interactions.

*Nikolai D. Klimkin,Misha Ivanov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Novel method reveals non-classical light states via symmetry-breaking transitions in atom ensembles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the creation and manipulation of non-classical states of light is a key focus in modern attosecond science, building on the foundational problem of superradiance.

Method: A non-Markovian, non-perturbative numerical method is used to analyze photon emission in ensembles of indistinguishable atoms, leveraging symmetry-based selection rules to suppress single-photon emission.

Result: The system reaches a steady state via spontaneous transition into a collective symmetry-broken state, exhibiting drastically non-classical statistics.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the formation of a large quantum state of light with non-classical statistics through symmetry-breaking transitions in atom-photon ensembles.

Abstract: Creation and manipulation of non-classical states of light is rapidly
becoming the focus of modern attosecond science. Here, we demonstrate
numerically how such states can arise by considering a modification of the
well-known problem of superradiance encountered already by Dicke. Similarly to
him, we investigate photon emission by ensembles of indistinguishable atoms. In
contrast to him, however, we leverage symmetry-based selection rules to
suppress emission of single photons by single atoms. A steady state is
therefore only reached following a spontaneous transition into a collective
symmetry-broken state of atoms and photonic modes. The novel non-Markovian,
non-perturbative method applied allows us to observe a large quantum state of
light form and exhibit drastically non-classical statistics once the system
undergoes a symmetry-breaking transition.

*Xiangjun Tan,Zhanning Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A spin-qubit magnetometry method for probing axion-electron couplings achieves high sensitivity, leveraging sidereal and annual modulation effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To search for couplings between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins.

Method: We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer using gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked with sub-Hz spectral resolution.

Result: For axion masses between 1-10 μeV, the proposed method covers axion-electron coupling strengths gae ranging from 10^-14 to 10^-10. The method also demonstrates clear evidence of sidereal modulation due to Earth's rotation and annual modulation patterns.

Conclusion: Our results indicate that spin-qubit magnetometry can achieve sensitivities approaching those suggested by astrophysical considerations, providing a complementary, laboratory-based probe of axion-electron interactions.

Abstract: We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer for searching couplings
between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins, using
gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo
sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked
with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined
using a series of filtering protocols that take into account sensing noise,
including readout errors and $1/f$ noise. We demonstrate clear evidence of
sidereal modulation of the signal due to Earth's rotation, while Earth's
orbital motion produces an annual amplitude envelope that generates sidebands
at fixed frequency spacing $\pm \Omega_\oplus$ around the sidereal component.
For axion masses between $1$-$10~\mu{\rm eV}$, the proposed method covers
axion-electron coupling strengths $g_{ae}$ ranging from $10^{-14}$ to
$10^{-10}$. Including both daily and annual modulation patterns in the
likelihood analysis enhances the rejection of stationary or instrumental noise.
Our results indicate that spin-qubit magnetometry can achieve sensitivities
approaching those suggested by astrophysical considerations, providing a
complementary, laboratory-based probe of axion-electron interactions. Although
we focus on silicon spin-qubit architectures, the approach is broadly
applicable to spin-based quantum sensors.

TL;DR: Quantum correlations are more robust than classical ones as a thermodynamic resource, despite both having the same peak extractable work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how initial system-environment correlations serve as a thermodynamic resource and compare the robustness of work extraction across different types of correlations.

Method: Comparative analysis of work extraction from classical, quantum, and hypothetical stronger-than-quantum correlations as a function of measurement misalignment.

Result: Classical correlations are fragile and decay linearly with misalignment, while quantum correlations are robust and decay quadratically. All models can yield a peak extractable work of k_B T ln 2.

Conclusion: The degree of nonlocality in quantum correlations maps to their operational robustness as a thermodynamic fuel, unlike classical correlations which are fragile.

Abstract: Initial system-environment correlations are a thermodynamic resource,
enabling work extraction via their erasure. We compare the work potential of
classical, quantum, and hypothetical stronger-than-quantum correlations as a
function of measurement misalignment. While all models can yield a peak
extractable work of k_B T ln 2, corresponding to a mutual information of ln 2,
their value as a resource differs critically in its robustness. The classical
resource is fragile, decaying linearly with misalignment, whereas the quantum
resource is robust, decaying only quadratically. Thus, the degree of
nonlocality maps not to the maximum energetic value of a correlation, but to
its operational robustness as a thermodynamic fuel.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Coupled quantum harmonic oscillators exhibit quantum features like entanglement through frequency shifts, enabling enhanced sensing in classical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the traditional view that coupled quantum harmonic oscillators in their ground state lack inherently quantum features beyond quantized energy levels.

Method: The authors analyze the characteristic frequency shifts in coupled quantum harmonic oscillators and relate them to non-classical correlations and two-mode squeezing between uncoupled modes.

Result: Frequency shifts in the system serve as a signature of entanglement and non-classical correlations, enabling quantum-enhanced sensing without requiring squeezed quantum noise.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that frequency shifts in coupled quantum harmonic oscillators can act as an entanglement witness, revealing non-classical correlations and ground-state entanglement, thereby offering a new route to quantum-enhanced sensing in traditionally classical systems.

Abstract: It is often argued that two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, even when
cooled to their ground state, display no inherently quantum features beyond
quantized energy levels. Here, we challenge this view by showing that their
classical observables can encode genuinely quantum features. In particular, we
demonstrate that the characteristic frequency shifts observed in such systems
act as a signature of non-classical correlations and ground-state entanglement
at zero temperature, specifically two-mode squeezing between the uncoupled
modes. From a complementary perspective, these two effects -- frequency shifts
and squeezing -- represent the same underlying phenomenon expressed in
different mode bases. What appears as a spectral renormalization in one
description manifests as entanglement in another. These shifts therefore can
serve as an entanglement witness accessible via standard frequency
measurements. Furthermore, we show that this underlying squeezing, although not
directly measurable, can be exploited to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in
precision frequency measurements of individual oscillators without requiring
squeezed quantum noise. Our results uncover a new route to quantum-enhanced
sensing within systems traditionally regarded as classical, offering fresh
insight into how signatures of quantumness persist across the
quantum-to-classical boundary.

TL;DR: Experimental realization of quantum streaming algorithms shows quantum space advantage persists with fault-tolerance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To experimentally validate the theoretical exponential quantum advantage in space for quantum streaming algorithms by addressing the challenge of maintaining qubit coherence while interacting with an external data stream.

Method: Implemented a quantum pair sketch on a trapped-ion quantum computer and compiled the algorithm to fault-tolerant architectures based on surface and bivariate bicycle codes.

Result: Successful implementation of a quantum pair sketch and demonstration of quantum space advantage for the Hidden Matching problem, even in fault-tolerant settings.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the experimental realization of quantum streaming algorithms using Quantinuum Helios trapped-ion quantum computer, showing that the quantum space advantage persists even with the overheads of fault-tolerance.

Abstract: Large classical datasets are often processed in the streaming model, with
data arriving one item at a time. In this model, quantum algorithms have been
shown to offer an unconditional exponential advantage in space. However,
experimentally implementing such streaming algorithms requires qubits that
remain coherent while interacting with an external data stream. In this work,
we realize such a data-streaming model using Quantinuum Helios trapped-ion
quantum computer with long-lived qubits that communicate with an external
server. We implement a quantum pair sketch, which is the primitive underlying
many quantum streaming algorithms, and use it to solve Hidden Matching, a
problem known to exhibit a theoretical exponential quantum advantage in space.
Furthermore, we compile the quantum streaming algorithm to fault-tolerant
quantum architectures based on surface and bivariate bicycle codes and show
that the quantum space advantage persists even with the overheads of
fault-tolerance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bottleneck of individual optimization of quantum circuit parameters in variational quantum eigensolvers by enabling parameter transferability across molecules.

Method: Utilized a well-investigated quantum circuit design applied to hydrogenic systems to explore parameter transferability between different molecules.

Result: Successful demonstration of parameter prediction that is transferable to significantly larger instances than those in the training set.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that machine learning-based parameter prediction can achieve systematic transferability to larger molecular instances, extending beyond the training set.

Abstract: The individual optimization of quantum circuit parameters is currently one of
the main practical bottlenecks in variational quantum eigensolvers for
electronic systems. To this end, several machine learning approaches have been
proposed to mitigate the problem. However, such method predominantly aims at
training and predicting parameters tailored to individual molecules: either a
specific structure, or several structures of the same molecule with varying
bond lengths. This work explores machine learning based modeling strategies to
include transferability between different molecules. We use a well investigated
quantum circuit design and apply it to model properties of hydrogenic systems
where we show parameter prediction that is systematically transferable to
instances significantly larger than the training instances.

Motivation: To extend quantum information measures beyond the Nishimori line and establish them as sharp indicators of phase transitions, while deriving exact inequalities for generalized measures.

Method: Fermionic transfer matrix method applied to the 2d ±J random-bond Ising model, corresponding to a surface code under bit-flip noise, with system sizes up to 512 and over 10^7 disorder realizations.

Result: Critical points from statistical and information-theoretic indicators coincide at p_c=0.1092212(4), with coherent information showing the smallest finite-size effects.

Conclusion: The study confirms the coherence information's minimal finite-size effects and the scale invariance of domain-wall free energy distribution at the multicritical point.

Abstract: The quantum error correction threshold is closely related to the Nishimori
physics of random statistical models. We extend quantum information measures
such as coherent information beyond the Nishimori line and establish them as
sharp indicators of phase transitions. We derive exact inequalities for several
generalized measures, demonstrating that each attains its extremum along the
Nishimori line. Using a fermionic transfer matrix method, we compute these
quantities in the 2d $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model-corresponding to a surface
code under bit-flip noise-on system sizes up to $512$ and over $10^7$ disorder
realizations. All critical points extracted from statistical and
information-theoretic indicators coincide with high precision at
$p_c=0.1092212(4)$, with the coherent information exhibiting the smallest
finite-size effects. We further analyze the domain-wall free energy
distribution and confirm its scale invariance at the multicritical point.

Abstract: We investigate the statistical properties of one-dimensional Burgers dynamics
evolving from stochastic initial conditions defined by a Poisson point process
for the velocity potential, with a power-law intensity. Thanks to the
geometrical interpretation of the solution in the inviscid limit, in terms of
first-contact parabolas, we obtain explicit results for the multiplicity
functions of shocks and voids, and for velocity and density one- and two-point
correlation functions and power spectra. These initial conditions gives rise to
self-similar dynamics with probability distributions that display power-law
tails. In the limit where the exponent $\alpha$ of the Poisson process that
defines the initial conditions goes to infinity, the power-law tails steepen to
Gaussian falloffs and we recover the spatial distributions obtained in the
classical study by Kida (1979) of Gaussian initial conditions with vanishing
large-scale power.
