Abstract: Sub-wavelength cavities have emerged as a promising platform to realize strong light-matter coupling in condensed matter systems. Previous studies are limited to dielectric sub-wavelength cavities, which preserve time-reversal symmetry. Here, we lift this constraint by proposing a cavity system based on magneto-electric materials, which host surface electromagnons with non-orthogonal electric field and magnetic field components. The quantum fluctuations of the surface electromagnons drive a nearby graphene monolayer into an anyonic Chern insulator, characterized by anyonic quasi-particles and a topological gap that decays polynomially with the graphene-substrate distance. Our work opens a path to controllably break time-reversal symmetry and induce exotic quantum states through cavity vacuum fluctuations.

### [2] [A Hierarchy of Fibonacci Forbidden-Word Hamiltonians: From the Golden Chain to the Plastic Chain and Aperiodic Order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10672)
*Marcelo Maciel Amaral*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A hierarchy of frustration-free Hamiltonians with decreasing exponential growth constants is introduced, validated theoretically and experimentally, showing a transition to a zero-entropy aperiodic fixed point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the properties of frustration-free Hamiltonians and their ground-state languages, particularly focusing on the transition from high-entropy phases to a zero-entropy aperiodic fixed point, and to validate these findings experimentally.

Method: The method involves constructing a scale-aligned hierarchy of one-dimensional Hamiltonians, forbidding minimal forbidden factors of the Fibonacci word, and analyzing the ground-state languages and their properties. Theoretical proofs and experimental validation using a D-Wave quantum annealer are included.

Result: The results show a staircase of topological-entropy plateaus converging to the Fibonacci subshift, with specific recurrence relations and closed-form solutions for ground-state counts. Experimental validation on a quantum annealer supports the theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The study introduces a hierarchy of frustration-free Hamiltonians, with ground-state languages showing decreasing exponential growth constants, and provides theoretical and experimental validation, including successful realization on a quantum annealer.

Abstract: We introduce an infinite, scale-aligned hierarchy of one-dimensional, frustration-free Hamiltonians by forbidding the minimal forbidden factors of the Fibonacci word up to length $F_K$, the $K$-th Fibonacci number. The ground-state languages have exponential growth constants $λ_K$ that decrease monotonically, starting from the value associated with the ``golden chain'' (approximately 1.618) and progressing toward 1. This process yields a staircase of topological-entropy plateaus that flows to an aperiodic fixed point, also known as the Fibonacci subshift. The first nontrivial rung ($K=4$) is the ``Plastic chain,'' which forbids \texttt{SS} and \texttt{LLL}. We prove its ground-state counts follow a specific four-term linear recurrence relation and provide a closed-form solution governed by the plastic constant $ρ\approx 1.3247$. We propose an energy-entropy scaling where the energy penalty for each new forbidden pattern is proportional to the logarithmic ratio of the growth constants from the previous and current rungs, turning the sequence of projectors into an explicit renormalization-group flow from the initial high-entropy phase to the zero-entropy aperiodic fixed point. Algebraically, exact Temperley-Lieb braiding compatibility holds only at the base rung, $K=3$ (which forbids only \texttt{SS}); higher rungs define constrained aperiodic Hamiltonian codes rather than Temperley-Lieb representations. Small instances realized on a D-Wave quantum annealer match these predictions: $K=3$ is trivial, $K=4$ resolves a unit gap with moderate success, and $K\ge 5$ instances require reverse annealing to exceed $99\%$ success, clarifying reduction penalties and embedding variability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究量子关联（NG、QD、QM-EUR）在外部脉冲和退相干通道影响下的动态行为，以及如何通过调整系统参数优化量子系统的性能。

Method: 研究了在外加脉冲和各种退相干通道（包括幅度阻尼、纯退相干和脉冲诱导退相干）下，双量子比特系统中NG、QD和QM-EUR的动态行为。

Result: 量子比特间的耦合和能量分裂显著影响动态行为，弱耦合区产生显著振荡，强耦合区保护预存纠缠。脉冲参数和初始态在控制关联生成和耗散中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 通过调整系统参数可以控制量子关联的稳定性和寿命，为量子计算和安全通信等需要强纠缠和长时相干性的应用提供了优化框架。

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of key quantum correlations - Negativity (NG), Quantum Discord (QD), and Quantum-Memory-Assisted Entropic Uncertainty (QM-EUR) - in a bipartite two-qubit system under the influence of external pulses and various decoherence channels, including amplitude damping (gamma_amp), pure dephasing (gamma_deph), and pulse-induced dephasing (G), while different regimes of inter-qubit coupling (Jzz, Jxx), qubit energy splitting (epsilon), and pulse parameters (A_pulse, beta_pulse) are explored. Our results show that inter-qubit coupling and energy splitting epsilon significantly influence the dynamics, producing pronounced oscillations in the weak-coupling regime and protecting pre-existing entanglement in the strong-coupling regime. NG is the most sensitive, QD persists longer revealing nonclassical correlations independent of entanglement, and QM-EUR reflects residual quantum memory and entropic uncertainty, showing that quantum signatures survive even when NG and QD are weak. Pulse amplitude and width effectively control the generation and dissipation of correlations, while the intensity of pulse-induced dephasing modulates the balance between sustained oscillations and rapid decoherence. The initial state also plays a crucial role: a partially entangled initial state is more resilient to perturbations, preserving correlations over time, whereas a separable state exhibits cycles of entanglement creation and destruction. Thus, by adjusting system parameters, it is possible to control the stability and lifetime of correlations and coherence, providing a framework to optimize quantum systems for applications requiring both strong entanglement and long-lasting coherence, such as quantum computing and secure communication.

TL;DR: 通过高品质拉曼光谱和电阻率测量证明LaH10的声子介导超导性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高压下氢化物在高温超导中的可靠诊断工具

Method: 结合电阻率测量和高品质拉曼光谱分析

Result: 通过拉曼光谱定量确定了超导能隙

Conclusion: 解决了有关氢化物高温超导性的争议

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in hydrogen-rich compounds under extreme pressures has prompted great excitement, intense research, but also debate over the past decade. Electrical transport has been the primary diagnostic tool for identifying superconductivity in these systems, whereas complementary probes, including magnetic, spectroscopic, tunnelling and ultrafast methods, remain mostly qualitative due to experimental constraints and sample heterogeneity. Recent concerns over their reliability have fuelled controversy, leading to scepticism and pointing out the need for alternative, quantitative approaches. In this study, we acquired unprecedented high-quality Raman spectra of hexagonal LaH10 at approximately 145 GPa and low temperatures, in conjunction with electrical transport measurements. Upon cooling, we observe a drop of resistivity and simultaneous remarkable variations of phonon frequencies and linewidths. These effects are interpreted and perfectly reproduced by the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, providing a definitive proof of phonon-mediated superconductivity and enabling a quantitative determination of the superconducting energy gap. Our results establish Raman spectroscopy as a robust, contact-free probe with micrometric resolution for studying high temperature superconductivity, opening a powerful route to its discovery and characterization.

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Optical properties of superconducting K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ were studied, revealing normal and superconducting state behaviors, including gap formation and condensate signatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate the optical and superconducting properties of K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ to understand its behavior in both normal and superconducting states.

Method: The researchers measured the optical properties of K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ using infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry across a temperature range of 4--300 K. The normal-state reflectance was analyzed with a Drude-Lorentz model.

Result: In the normal state, the plasma frequency, optical conductivity, scattering rate, and dc resistivity were determined. In the superconducting state, a gap opening at $2Δ$(5~K) = 11.8~meV was observed. The superconducting plasma frequency and magnetic penetration depth were quantified.

Conclusion: The study confirms the superconducting properties of K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ single crystals, with measurable signatures of the superconducting gap and condensate formation below $T_c$. The determined superconducting plasma frequency and magnetic penetration depth provide key insights into its electromagnetic response.

Abstract: The optical properties of the superconducting K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ single crystals with a critical temperature $T_c\approx 26$ K have been measured in the {\it ab} plane in a wide frequency range using both infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry at temperatures of 4--300 K. The normal-state reflectance of K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ is analyzed using a Drude-Lorentz model with one Drude component. The temperature dependences of the plasma frequency, optical conductivity, scattering rate, and dc resistivity of the Drude contribution in the normal state are presented. In the superconducting state, we observe a signature of the superconducting gap opening at $2Δ$(5~K) = 11.8~meV. An abrupt decrease in the low-frequency dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon _1(ω)$ at $T < T_c$ also evidences the formation of the superconducting condensate. The superconducting plasma frequency $ω_{pl,s} = (213\pm 5)$~cm$^{-1}$ and the magnetic penetration depth $λ=(7.5\pm 0.2)$~$μ$m at $T=5$~K are determined.

TL;DR: A topological theory for superfluid helium-4 using a rigid $U(1)$ model explains its properties and vortices via broken symmetry and domain walls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the superfluid properties of helium-4 and the presence of topologically nontrivial vortices through a topological framework.

Method: Constructing the topological theory using the rigid $U(1)$ model, where the initial $U(1)$ symmetry is broken, leading to domains separated by domain walls treated as step voltages.

Result: The model successfully describes the superfluid behavior of helium-4 and predicts the formation of topologically nontrivial vortices due to the domain structure.

Conclusion: The topological theory of superfluid helium-4, based on the rigid $U(1)$ model with destroyed initial symmetry and domain walls, provides a framework to explain its superfluid properties and the emergence of topologically nontrivial vortices.

Abstract: In this paper we attempt to construct the topological theory of superfluid helium $4$ in the framework of the (rigid) $U(1)$ model in which the initial $U(1)$ group is destroyed with appearance of (topologically nontrivial) domains separated by domain walls treated as step voltages between domains (e.g. with neighboring topological numbers). This can explain the superfluid properties in a helium $4$ specimen as well as the appearance of topologically nontrivial vortices therein.

Conclusion: 本文表明，即使在名义上的单分量超导体中，某些条件下也可能表现出多个相干长度，这导致类型1.5超导性，具有重要的物理意义。

Abstract: A fundamental characteristic of a superconducting state is the coherence length $ξ$. Multicomponent superconductors, particularly ones breaking multiple symmetries, are characterized by multiple coherence lengths. Here we show that even, nominally $single$-component superconductors under certain conditions are characterized by multiple coherence lengths. We consider nearest-neighbor pairing interactions on a square lattice that leads to $s$-wave and $d$-wave representations of link superconducting order parameter. We show that even if the subdominant order parameter is completely suppressed in the ground state, it results in multiple correlation lengths with nontrivial hierarchy, resulting in important physical consequences in inhomogeneous solutions. Under certain conditions, this leads to type-1.5 superconductivity, where magnetic field penetration length falls between two coherence lengths, leading to vortex clustering in an external magnetic field.
