Motivation: 提出一种替代无限密度矩阵重整化群的方法，以在有限尺寸计算中更真实地模拟热力学极限下的量子多体态。

Method: 通过构造半无限区域的哈密顿量矩阵乘积算子（MPO）并递归地将其嵌入到有限系统中，逐步逼近热力学极限下的体态。

Result: 该方法成功消除了有限尺寸效应，实现了无边界反射的长时间动力学计算，且无需假设系统的均匀性。

Conclusion: 该方案成功地实现了在有限计算中模拟热力学极限的量子多体态，消除了边界反射效应，展现了前所未有的长时间动力学行为。

Abstract: We propose an alternative to the infinite density-matrix renormalization approach for accessing quantum many-body states within a finite-size calculation that faithfully mimics the thermodynamic limit. Our method constructs environment matrix product operators (MPOs) representing the Hamiltonian of semi-infinite regions surrounding the target system. Starting from the finite-size ground-state MPS, we contract its Hamiltonian representation to generate effective environment MPOs, which are then attached to a renewed finite system in a recursive manner. This iterative embedding drives the system toward a bulk-like state with negligible finite-size effects. The scheme requires no assumption of homogeneity and achieves unprecedentedly long real-time dynamics free from boundary reflections.

### [3] [Is disorder a friend or a foe to melting of Wigner-Mott insulators?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07932)
*Mohammed Hammam,Cyprian Lewandowski,Vladimir Dobrosavljevic,Sandeep Joy*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Disorder stabilizes Wigner crystals, smearing their melting transition in 2D, leading to coexisting solid and liquid regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fragility of Wigner crystals and how disorder influences their stability and melting behavior, particularly in two dimensions.

Method: Explicit microscopic model calculations were used to illustrate the effects of disorder on Wigner crystals, including the stabilization mechanism and the smearing of the melting transition.

Result: Disorder suppresses gapless excitations, stabilizing Wigner lattices at higher temperatures and densities. In two dimensions, disorder smears the melting transition, causing spatial coexistence of solid-like and liquid-like regions.

Conclusion: The study reveals that disorder stabilizes Wigner crystals to higher temperatures and densities, while also smearing the melting transition in two dimensions, leading to spatial coexistence of solid-like and liquid-like regions. This provides a new understanding of Wigner-Mott solids' melting behavior.

Abstract: Wigner crystals are extremely fragile, which is shown to result from very strong geometric frustration germane to long-range Coulomb interactions. Physically, this is manifested by a very small characteristic energy scale for shear density fluctuations, which are gapless excitations in a translationally invariant system. The presence of disorder, however, breaks translational invariance, thus suppressing gapless excitations and pushing them to higher density. We illustrate this general principle by explicit microscopic model calculations, showing that this mechanism very effectively stabilizes disordered Wigner lattices to much higher temperatures and densities than in the clean limit. On the other hand, we argue that in two dimensions disorder significantly ``smears" the melting transition, producing spatial coexistence of solid-like and liquid-like regions -- just as recently observed in STM experiments. Our results paint a new physical picture for melting of Wigner-Mott solids in two dimensions, corresponding to a Mott-Hubbard model with spatially varying local electronic bandwidth.

*Leandro M. Chinellato,Oleg A. Starykh,Cristian D. Batista*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A non-perturbative framework is introduced for quantizing chiral solitons in spin chains, revealing unconventional dynamics and tunneling behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: We introduce a non-perturbative framework for quantizing chiral solitons in interacting quantum spin chains, bridging the gap between continuum dualities and their lattice counterparts.

Method: By constructing the quantum chiral-soliton operators explicitly, we show how their unconventional dynamics appear in the excitation spectrum and correlation functions across the full Brillouin zone.

Result: The dominant soliton tunneling amplitude alternates in sign, sharply distinguishing half-odd-integer from integer spin chains.

Conclusion: Our results open a route to experimentally probing non-perturbative features of dual quantum field theories in condensed-matter settings.

Abstract: We introduce a non-perturbative framework for quantizing chiral solitons in interacting quantum spin chains. This approach provides a direct lattice extension of the well-established $S$-duality between the sine-Gordon and Thirring models, thereby bridging the gap between continuum dualities and their lattice counterparts. By constructing the quantum chiral-soliton operators explicitly, we show how their unconventional dynamics appear in the excitation spectrum and correlation functions across the full Brillouin zone. A key result is that the dominant soliton tunneling amplitude alternates in sign, $\operatorname{sgn}(t_{1+}) = (-1)^{2S+1}$, sharply distinguishing half-odd-integer from integer spin chains. We further identify characteristic signatures of these chiral excitations in the dynamical spin structure factor, demonstrating their visibility in inelastic neutron scattering. Our results open a route to experimentally probing non-perturbative features of dual quantum field theories in condensed-matter settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨二维电子-空穴系统中拓扑自旋三重态激子凝聚及其与其他稳定性的竞争，考虑Rashba自旋轨道耦合和外部磁场的影响。

Method: 采用无限制Hartree-Fock方法，自洽评估了自旋选择性激子凝聚序参量和陈数。

Result: 相图中出现具有非零陈数的自旋三重态激子凝聚态，远离拓扑平凡的单重态和自旋反向三重态激子凝聚区域。强自旋极化三重态激子涨落通过动态激子磁化谱的签名进一步揭示。

Conclusion: 研究结果确定了一类由激子相干性驱动的拓扑量子相，并提出了在TMDs的Janus单层或某些扭曲范德瓦尔斯异质结构中实现这一现象的现实途径。

Abstract: We investigate topological spin-up triplet excitonic condensation and its competition with other stabilities in a two-dimensional interacting electron-hole system taking into account Rashba spin-orbit coupling and external magnetic fields. Using an unrestricted Hartree-Fock approach, we self-consistently evaluate spin-selective excitonic condensate order parameters and the Chern number. The ground state phase diagram in the dependence on magnetic field and Coulomb interaction shows a spin-up triplet excitonic condensate (EC) with a nonzero Chern number, emerging uniquely away from the topologically trivial singlet and spin-down triplet EC regions. Strong spin-polarized triplet excitonic fluctuations preceding the condensation are further revealed through the signatures of the dynamical excitonic susceptibility spectra. Our results establish a class of topological quantum phases driven by excitonic coherence and suggest a realistic pathway to its realization in a distorted Janus monolayer of transition metal dichalcogenides or some twisted van der Waals heterostructures.

### [6] [Decay of spin helices in XXZ quantum spin chains with single-ion anisotropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08421)
*Florian Lange,Frank Göhmann,Gerhard Wellein,Holger Fehske*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Spin-helices in antiferromagnetic chains can remain stable despite single-ion anisotropy, with easy-axis conditions further enhancing their longevity, as shown by simulations and theoretical approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to understand the dynamics of non-equilibrium states in quantum magnets, specifically focusing on the decay of transverse spin-helices in systems with single-ion anisotropy.

Method: The research employs infinite time-evolving block decimation simulations to numerically calculate the time evolution of local magnetization in the thermodynamic limit, complemented by a spin-wave approximation to estimate the most stable wave number.

Result: Numerical results indicate that spin-helices can be long-lived for specific wave numbers, especially under easy-axis exchange anisotropy. The spin-wave approximation provides a qualitative agreement with these findings.

Conclusion: The study reveals that long-lived spin-helix states can exist in antiferromagnetic spin-$S$ XXZ chains with single-ion anisotropy, despite not being eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. The stabilization effect of easy-axis exchange anisotropy on these helices is particularly notable.

Abstract: Long-lived spin-helix states facilitate the study of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum magnets. We consider the decay of transverse spin-helices in antiferromagnetic spin-$S$ XXZ chains with single-ion anisostropy. The spin-helix decay is observable in the time evolution of the local magnetization that we calculate numerically for the system in the thermodynamic limit using infinite time-evolving block decimation simulations. Although the single-ion anisotropy prevents helix states from being eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, they still can be long-lived for appropriately chosen wave numbers. In case of an easy-axis exchange anisotropy the single-ion anisotropy may even stabilize the helices. Within a spin-wave approximation, we obtain a condition giving an estimate for the most stable wave number $Q$ that agrees qualitatively with our numerical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解强关联材料中不同能带电子之间的复杂交换需要准确处理多轨道模型，而高效量子杂质求解器的可用性是DMFT框架的关键。

Method: 提出了基于神经量子态（NQS）并结合算子-Lanczos构建的实频杂质求解器。

Result: 在单轨道Anderson模型和多轨道Hubbard-Kanamori杂质哈密顿量上表现出优异的地态精度，并能准确解析零温谱函数和自能。

Conclusion: 该研究为扩展DMFT在更具挑战性问题中的应用提供了新的途径。

Abstract: To understand the intricate exchange between electrons of different bands in strongly correlated materials, it is essential to treat multi-orbital models accurately. For this purpose, dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) provides an established framework, whose scope crucially hinges on the availability of efficient quantum impurity solvers. Here we present a real-frequency impurity solver based on neural quantum states (NQS) combined with an operator-Lanczos construction. NQS are an asymptotically unbiased variational ground-state ansatz that employs neural networks to capture long-range correlations on complicated graph structures. We leverage this ability to solve multi-orbital impurity problems using a systematically improvable Segmented Commutator Operator-Lanczos (SCOL) construction. Our benchmarks on both the single-orbital Anderson model and the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori impurity Hamiltonian reveal excellent ground-state precision and the capacity to accurately resolve zero temperature spectral functions and self-energies. These results open avenues for extending DMFT to more challenging problems.

### [8] [Diffusion and relaxation of topological excitations in layered spin liquids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08712)
*Aprem P. Joy,Roman Lange,Achim Rosch*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Pump-probe experiments reveal unique signatures of 2D topological excitations in 3D materials, with distinct relaxation behaviors depending on annihilation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand relaxation processes in topological phases and how they are influenced by fractionalized excitations, particularly in layered materials.

Method: Utilized exact solutions of nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations.

Result: Found that excitation density spreads subdiffusively (∼t¹/³) without annihilation, logarithmically (∼log t) with annihilation, and decays as ∼(log² t)/t due to pair-diffusion.

Conclusion: The study highlights how pump-probe experiments can uniquely identify 2D topological excitations in 3D materials through distinct relaxation behaviors.

Abstract: Relaxation processes in topological phases such as quantum spin liquids are controlled by the dynamics and interaction of fractionalized excitations. In layered materials hosting two-dimensional topological phases, elementary quasiparticles can diffuse freely within the layer, whereas only pairs (or more) can hop between layers - a fundamental consequence of topological order. Using exact solutions of emergent nonlinear diffusion equations and particle-based stochastic simulations, we explore how pump-probe experiments can provide unique signatures of the presence of $2d$ topological excitations in a $3d$ material. Here we show that the characteristic time scale of such experiments is inversely proportional to the initial excitation density, set by the pump intensity. A uniform excitation density created on the surface of a sample spreads subdiffusively into the bulk with a mean depth $\bar z$ scaling as $\sim t^{1/3}$ when annihilation processes are absent. The propagation becomes logarithmic, $\bar z \sim \log t$, when pair-annihilation is allowed. Furthermore, pair-diffusion between layers leads to a new decay law for the total density, $n(t) \sim (\log^2 t)/t$ - slower than in a purely $2d$ system. We discuss possible experimental implications for pump-probe experiments in samples of finite width.

TL;DR: ESR study of Fe₄GeTe₂ reveals its complex magnetic anisotropy, linking it to electronic properties and suggesting potential for magneto-electronic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the magnetic anisotropy and spin reorientation transition in Fe₄GeTe₂, a promising near-room-temperature ferromagnet.

Method: Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was used to study the magnetic anisotropy of Fe₄GeTe₂.

Result: The study identified characteristic temperatures (T_SR ~ 110 K, T_shape ~ 150 K, T_d ~ 50 K) and linked magnetic anisotropy changes to electronic properties.

Conclusion: The ESR study reveals the complex magnetic anisotropy of Fe₄GeTe₂, highlighting its potential for use in magneto-electronic devices, especially in monolayer form.

Abstract: In the quest for two-dimensional conducting materials with high ferromagnetic ordering temperature the new family of the layered Fe$_{n}$GeTe$_{2}$ compounds, especially the near-room-temperature ferromagnet Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$, receives a significant attention. Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$ features a peculiar spin reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR} \sim 110$ K suggesting a non-trivial temperature evolution of the magnetic anisotropy (MA) - one of the main contributors to the stabilization of the magnetic order in the low-D systems. An electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopic study reported here provides quantitative insights into the unusual magnetic anisotropy of Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$. At high temperatures the total MA is mostly given by the demagnetization effect with a small contribution of the counteracting intrinsic magnetic anisotropy of an easy-axis type, whose growth below a characteristic temperature $T_{\rm shape} \sim 150$ K renders the sample seemingly isotropic at $T_\mathrm{SR}$. Below one further temperature $T_{\rm d} \sim 50$ K the intrinsic MA becomes even more complex. Importantly, all the characteristic temperatures found in the ESR experiment match those observed in transport measurements, suggesting an inherent coupling between magnetic and electronic degrees of freedom in Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$. This finding together with the observed signatures of the intrinsic two-dimensionality should facilitate optimization routes for the use of Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$ in the magneto-electronic devices, potentially even in the monolayer limit.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The study resolves field-induced magnetic orders in a $J_1-J_2$ triangular lattice, identifying plateaux transitions as signatures of a quantum spin-liquid phase using multiple theoretical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The behavior of the $J_1-J_2$ triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a magnetic field has remained unresolved despite decades of study.

Method: Three complementary approaches were employed: self-consistent nonlinear spin-wave theory, density-matrix renormalization group, and variational Monte Carlo.

Result: In the parameter regime around $J_2/J_1=\frac{1}{8}$, the quantum spin liquid acquires a finite density of monopoles under an external field, and two plateaux at $m=\frac{1}{3}$ and $m=\frac{1}{2}$ are observed with increasing field.

Conclusion: The study resolves the competition among different field-induced magnetic orders and magnetization plateaux in the $J_1-J_2$ triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, highlighting the experimental significance of consecutive magnetization plateaux transitions as a signature of an underlying quantum spin-liquid phase.

Abstract: The behavior of the paradigmatic $J_1-J_2$ triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a magnetic field remains unsettled despite decades of study. We map out the phase diagram using three complementary approaches, including self-consistent nonlinear spin-wave theory, density-matrix renormalization group, and variational Monte Carlo. This combined analysis resolves the competition among different field-induced magnetic orders and magnetization plateaux across the classically frustrated parameter range. In particular, there is a finite range in the parameter regime around $J_2/J_1=\frac{1}{8}$ in which i) upon the application of the external field, the gapless quantum spin liquid acquires a finite density of monopoles, and ii) by further increasing the field, two plateaux are clearly obtained at $m=\frac{1}{3}$ and $m=\frac{1}{2}$. We discuss the experimental importance of the consecutive magnetization plateaux transitions as a signature of an underlying quantum spin-liquid phase.

### [11] [Magnetic Phase Control of a Thick SNS Weak Link: Proposed experimental scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07862)
*Aleksey Turchanov*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Thick SNS junctions exhibit strong phase-flux coupling, potentially enabling compact phase control in superconducting circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of quantitative experimental data on magnetic control of the Josephson phase in thick SNS weak links, contrary to the belief that such control is negligibly small in compact structures.

Method: The study uses a thick SNS bridge with an on-chip microcoil and analyzes phase-flux coupling near the Josephson plasma resonance within a standard RSJ/RCSJ model and linear circuit theory.

Result: Thick SNS weak links achieve phase-flux efficiencies of 30-60% of an ideal dc SQUID, driven by large kinetic inductance and resonant amplification (15-35 dB), without exotic microphysics.

Conclusion: If confirmed experimentally, thick SNS junctions may become compact phase elements for dense, locally addressable phase control in superconducting quantum circuits.

Abstract: In contrast to the extensive literature on thin tunnel junctions and traditional SQUID geometries, there is almost no quantitative experimental data on magnetic control of the Josephson phase in thick SNS weak links. The standard view is that in such compact structures without macroscopic loops the local magnetic coupling to the phase is negligibly small, which in practice forces one to use bulky SQUID devices for phase control. We show that this view is overly restrictive. We consider a thick SNS bridge with an on-chip microcoil placed directly above it, which controls the Josephson phase via strong phase-flux coupling enhanced near the Josephson plasma resonance. In the proposed configuration realistic thick SNS weak links, with normal-layer thickness d of order xi, can achieve phase-flux efficiencies of order 30-60 percent of an ideal dc SQUID. Within a standard RSJ/RCSJ model and linear circuit theory we show that this unexpectedly strong coupling arises from the combination of a large kinetic inductance of the thick SNS bridge and resonant amplification of about 15-35 dB, rather than from any exotic microphysics. The proposed experiment, a comparative analysis of Shapiro steps driven by a direct RF signal and by the magnetic field of the same microcoil, provides a direct and quantitative method to measure the phase-flux response of a thick SNS junction. If confirmed experimentally, such structures may become compact phase elements capable of locally controlling the Josephson phase without a macroscopic loop and enabling dense, locally addressable phase control in superconducting quantum circuits.

### [12] [A unified model for lunderdoped and overdoped cuprate superconductors based on a spinodal transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08070)
*Hercules H. Santana,E. V. L. de Mello*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: A unified theory for cuprate superconductors explains CDW domains and granular superconductivity via a thermodynamic transition linked to the pseudogap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a complete theory for cuprate superconductors despite years of research and discoveries like the pseudogap and charge density waves.

Method: Analysis of experiments and calculations focusing on the anomalous Hall coefficient, undoped insulators, metallic films, and superconducting puddles.

Result: A thermodynamic transition starting near the pseudogap temperature generates CDW domains and local superconducting amplitudes, forming a mesoscopic granular superconductor.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a unified theory of cuprate superconductors, suggesting that a spinodal or charge-separation transition generates CDW domains and leads to mesoscopic granular superconductivity mediated by Josephson coupling.

Abstract: Many years of intense research on cuprate superconductors have led to several discoveries, such as the pseudogap and charge density waves (CDW), yet a complete theory is still lacking. By analyzing some experiments and performing calculations, we provide a full interpretation of their properties; from the undoped insulator to the overdoped metallic compounds. The variation of the anomalous Hall coefficient ($R_{\rm H}(T)$) with temperature at half-filling ($n = 1$) and, combinations of undoped ($p = 0$) insulators and metallic films, which, among other things, are indicative of a thermodynamic transition. On the overdoped side, recent experiments near the superconducting-to-metal transition detecting superconducting puddles and a considerable degree of charge disorder, suggest that a similar thermodynamic transition operates at all doping levels. We propose a spinodal or charge-separation transition starting near the pseudogap temperature $T^*(p)$, which among other things generates the CDW domains with a typical double-well Landau free-energy functional. Thus, from the half-filled to the overdoped region, the free energy forms an array of wells with $n = 1$ {\it static} holes. With doping, {\it mobile} holes tend to occupy these wells with alternating high and low densities, generating the CDW pattern. The confined holes in small regions develop local superconducting amplitudes, giving rise to a mesoscopic granular superconductor. Similar to the XY model, the grains develop correlation effects mediated by Josephson coupling, which is proportional to the local superfluid density. This approach yields a unified theory of cuprate superconductors.

Abstract: An analysis of the influence of the high-frequency electromagnetic field on the amplitude-frequency and signal characteristics of RF SQUID and experimental verification are carried out. At low parameter , the RF SQUID behavior is well described analytically by the theoretical model. In experiment, basic operation scheme is used in which the interferometer is inductively connected to a resonant tank circuit driven by RF current at a frequency close to the resonance frequency of the tank. It is shown that parameter , which distinguishes between hysteretic and non-hysteretic regimes, can be effectively adjusted to a desired value by applying the high-frequency field of a certain amplitude and frequency much higher than tank resonant frequency. A significant increase in the conversion factor and sensitivity of the RF SQUID during this adjustment is discussed.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-consistent solution to the Eliashberg equations for analyzing superconductivity in hydrides, validated against experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore more accurate theoretical approaches for predicting superconductivity in metal and molecular hydrides under high pressures.

Method: Solutions to the Eliashberg equations and analysis of electron-phonon spectral function and broadening parameters.

Result: The self-consistent solution aligns well with experimentally measured critical temperatures.

Conclusion: The self-consistent solution to the Eliashberg equations provides a reliable alternative to the McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula for analyzing superconductivity in hydrides, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: In recent years, the quest for high critical-temperature superconductors has increasingly focused on metal and molecular hydrides, which have demonstrated potential for superconductivity at or near room temperature under extremely high pressures. Such hydrides were first proposed by N. W. Ashcroft in 1968, because hydrogen-rich materials possess elevated vibrational frequencies due to the low atomic mass of hydrogen. This article presents a self-consistent solution to the Eliashberg equations for analysing superconductivity in hydrides, contrasting with the commonly used McMillan-Allen-Dynes parameterized formula. We also analyse effects of the electron-phonon spectral function and the broadening parameters arising from phonon lifetime and sample imperfections on the superconducting critical temperature. Finally, both theoretical approaches are applied to a typical metal hydride superconductor, and the reliability of self-consistent solutions is validated against the experimentally measured critical temperature.

Abstract: We develop a first-principles framework for finite-temperature structural optimization that incorporates vibrational contributions to the free energy through anharmonic phonon theory. We extend and further improve the efficiency of the recent approach, enabling its application to systems in which the size of the primitive cell changes across structural phase transitions. Applying this framework to La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we establish its pressure-temperature phase diagram and find that the slope of the phase boundary between the high-symmetry and low-symmetry phases is negative, with a magnitude of approximately -60 K / GPa.

Abstract: The effect of thermal fluctuations on the temperature dependence of the topological index C1 of the chiral d+id superconducting phase of a two-dimensional single-band model on a triangular lattice is investigated. Thermal fluctuations are taken into account within the framework of the self-consistent functional-integral theory. It is established that when the nodal points are located far inside (outside) the Fermi contour of the normal phase, thermal fluctuations expand the relative temperature ranges in which the values of the topological index are close to integer values C1=4(-2). This expansion depends both on the value of the topological index and on the magnitude of the effective attraction between the electrons. However, as the nodal points approach the Fermi contour, topological crossovers to new C1 values are observed, which can persist over a wide temperature range. The nature and degree of influence of thermal fluctuations on these crossovers are established. It is assumed that the observed effects may also manifest in the edge state behavior of a similar system with open boundaries.

TL;DR: The paper predicts a measurable enhancement in the imaginary ac-conductivity of type-II superconducting films due to quantum fluctuations, providing a way to detect previously unobservable vortex clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of observing fluctuation-induced vortex clusters in type-II superconductors, which were previously considered unobservable due to their ultrafast dynamics and weak contribution to dc-conductivity. The study aims to propose a detectable electromagnetic signature for these clusters.

Method: The paper analyzes the high-frequency electromagnetic response of rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs above the second critical field in superconducting films, focusing on quantum fluctuations and their impact on ac-conductivity.

Result: The research predicts a pronounced enhancement in the imaginary part of the ac-conductivity at characteristic frequencies below the superconducting threshold. This enhancement is directly linked to quantum fluctuations and is experimentally accessible in materials like niobium.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the fluctuation-induced vortex clusters in type-II superconducting films can be detected through their distinct electromagnetic signature, particularly in the high-frequency response. This provides a measurable enhancement in the imaginary part of the ac-conductivity, offering a testable prediction for experimental verification.

Abstract: The emergence of the Abrikosov lattice in the normal phase of type-II superconducting films when the magnetic field approaches the critical field $H_{c2}$ from above was predicted in Ref.~\cite{GVV2011}. In the quantum fluctuation regime \cite{GL2001} it is characterized by the formation of relatively large (with sizes of order $ξ_{\mathrm{QF}} \sim ξ_{\mathrm{BCS}}\sqrt{H_{c2}/(H-H_{c2})}$) ``long lived'' (lifetime of order $τ_{\mathrm{QF}} \sim \hbar Δ^{-1} H_{c2}/(H-H_{c2})$) clusters of rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs - signatures of developing Abrikosov vortices. We demonstrate that these fluctuation-induced vortex clusters, previously considered unobservable due to their ultrafast dynamics and weak (only logarithmically singular) contribution to the dc-conductivity, can in fact be detected through their distinct electromagnetic signature. By analyzing the high-frequency electromagnetic response of these rotating fluctuation Cooper pairs above the second critical field in superconducting film, we predict a pronounced and measurable enhancement in the imaginary part of the ac-conductivity arising directly from quantum fluctuations. This enhancement is expected to occur at characteristic frequencies $ω_{QF} \sim \hbar^{-1}Δ(H-H_{c2})/H_{c2}$, which are well below the superconducting threshold at $2\hbar^{-1}Δ$, where a similar increase in imaginary conductivity occurs in the superconducting phase. For niobium, a prototypical type II superconductor, $ω_{QF}$ lies in the experimentally accessible microwave range, making the effect directly testable with modern microwave spectroscopy.

Motivation: To understand superconductivity emerging from repulsive fermions, a major challenge in condensed matter physics.

Method: Density matrix renormalization group method was used to investigate the pairing tendencies in a one-dimensional, three-component repulsive Hubbard model.

Result: At half-filling, the system exhibits a density wave ground state. Upon doping, Cooper pairs emerge, mediated by particle-hole fluctuations in the third non-pairing component, resembling an excitonic mechanism of superconductivity.

Abstract: Understanding superconductivity emerging from repulsive fermions remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics. In this paper, we investigate the pairing tendencies in a one-dimensional, three component repulsive Hubbard model, using the density matrix renormalization group method. At half-filling, the system exhibits density wave ground state due to strong Hubbard repulsions. Upon doping, we find that Cooper pairs can emerge, whose fluctuations predominate the long-range physics in the system across a wide parameter range. The effective attractions between Cooper pairs are mediated by the particle-hole fluctuations in the third non-pairing component, resembling an excitonic mechanism of superconductivity. The coexistence of multiple density waves and superconductivity at different fermion fillings is explored. We also present an analytical study of the pairing mechanism in both weak and strong coupling limits. Our results provide a new perspective for understanding and exploring unconventional superconductivities in strongly correlated fermionic systems.

Abstract: We theoretically investigated the readout process of a spin--qubit structure based on a gate-all-around (GAA) transistor. Our study focuses on a logical qubit composed of two physical qubits. Different spin configurations result in different charge distributions, which subsequently influence the electrostatic effects on the GAA transistor. Consequently, the current flowing through the GAA transistor depends on the qubit's state. We calculated the current-voltage characteristics of the three-dimensional configurations of the qubit and GAA structures, using technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations. Moreover, we performed circuit simulations using the Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) to investigate whether a readout circuit made from complementary metal--oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors can amplify the weak signals generated by the qubits. Our findings indicate that, by dynamically controlling the applied voltage within a properly designed circuit, the readout can be detected effectively based on a conventional sense amplifier.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the reversal transition between different types of Weyl modes in a single material, which is crucial for fundamental research in Weyl physics and potential applications in spintronics.

Method: By tuning the direction and strength of the magnetic field in an ideal Dirac semimetal, Bi4(Br0.27I0.73)4, the study utilized magnetoresistivity measurements and electronic structure calculations to identify multiple Weyl modes.

Result: The study achieved the realization of multiple Weyl modes, including gapped Weyl mode, Weyl nodal ring, and coupled Weyl mode. Anomalous Hall effect and negative magnetoresistivity were observed under specific conditions.

Conclusion: The findings reveal distinct Weyl modes under intertwined crystal symmetry and time-reversal breaking, providing a foundation for manipulating multiple Weyl modes in chiral spintronic networks.

Abstract: The emergent Weyl modes with the broken time-reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry provide large Berry curvature and chirality to carriers, offering the realistic platforms to explore topology of electrons in three-dimensional systems. However, the reversal transition between different types of Weyl modes in a single material, which is of particular interest in the fundamental research in Weyl physics and potential application in spintronics, is scarcely achieved due to restriction of inborn symmetry in crystals. Here, by tuning the direction and strength of magnetic field in an ideal Dirac semimetal, Bi4(Br0.27I0.73)4, we report the realization of multiple Weyl modes, including gapped Weyl mode, Weyl nodal ring, and coupled Weyl mode by the magnetoresistivity measurements and electronic structure calculations. Specifically, under a magnetic field with broken mirror symmetry, anomalous Hall effect with step feature results from the large Berry curvature for the gapped Weyl mode. A prominent negative magnetoresistivity is observed at low magnetic field with preserved mirror symmetry and disappears at high magnetic field, which is correlated to the chiral anomaly and its annihilation of Weyl nodal ring, respectively. Our findings reveal distinct Weyl modes under the intertwined crystal symmetry and time-reversal breaking, laying the foundation of manipulating multiple Weyl modes in chiral spintronic network.

Conclusion: 通过RL去卷积技术，本研究成功解析了2D半导体STML发射的空间分布，揭示了激子和载流子输运的关键信息，填补了传统方法的不足。

Abstract: Using scanning tunneling microscopy-induced luminescence (STML), the optical properties of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors may be investigated at the nanoscale. This is possible because the tunneling current under the tip is an extremely localized electrical excitation source. However, in most STML applications, the spatial distribution of the emission relative to the excitation point is unresolved. Yet this distribution contains key information about how the interaction of excitons with injected charge carriers affects the luminescence of these materials, and about exciton transport. Resolving this spatial distribution at the nanoscale is relevant both for a fundamental understanding of exciton physics and for device applications; yet it remains a significant challenge. In this work, we resolve the spatial distribution of the emission beyond the diffraction limit of light by deconvolving real-space optical microscopy images of the STML using an iterative algorithm, i.e., Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution. To showcase this technique, we apply it to the STML of monolayer tungsten diselenide ($\mathrm{WSe_2}$) and tungsten disulfide ($\mathrm{WS_2}$). Thus, we highlight hitherto ignored or misunderstood aspects of STML on 2D semiconductors related to exciton and charge carrier transport, namely the dependence of the spatial distribution of emission on the tunnel current setpoint and the origin of the emission from hot spots located micrometers from the excitation source.

Result: The data revealed amorphous, uniform-density Co(acac)$_2$ spheres as transient intermediates that directly crystallize into cavernous CoO nanocrystal assemblies, explaining the formation of hierarchical aggregates.

Conclusion: SP-SAXS provides a powerful framework for disentangling morphological heterogeneity in nanoparticle formation processes, as demonstrated by the study of CoO nanocrystal assemblies.

Abstract: Single-particle small-angle X-ray scattering (SP-SAXS) enables quantitative morphological analysis by recording diffraction snapshots from isolated particles using X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) pulses. Unlike conventional X-ray techniques, which average over the entire illuminated sample volume, SP-SAXS resolves low-contrast, less abundant, or transient species within heterogeneous particle populations that would otherwise remain hidden. Here, we apply SP-SAXS to investigate the solvothermal formation of CoO nanocrystal assemblies from a Co(acac)$_3$ precursor in benzyl alcohol. The single-particle data reveal amorphous, uniform-density Co(acac)$_2$ spheres as transient intermediates that directly crystallize into cavernous CoO nanocrystal assemblies, which explains why CoO forms as hierarchical aggregates rather than as isolated nanocrystals. These results demonstrate that SP-SAXS provides a powerful framework for disentangling morphological heterogeneity in nanoparticle formation processes.

Result: The study confirms the existence of triangular modes in quantum solutions and demonstrates their influence on anisotropic transport in open BLG cavities.

Conclusion: The study successfully bridges the gap between simulations and experimental observations, providing insights into anisotropic electron transport in BLG cavities and offering practical setups for experimental detection and modulation.

Abstract: Closing the gap between ray tracing simulations and experimentally observed electron jetting in bilayer graphene (BLG), we study all-electronic, gate-defined BLG cavities using tight-binding simulations and semiclassical equations of motion. Such cavities offer a rich playground to investigate anisotropic electron transport due to the trigonally warped Fermi surfaces. In this work, we achieve two things: First, we verify the existence of triangular modes (as predicted by classical ray tracing calculations) in the quantum solutions of closed circular BLG cavities. Then, we explore signatures of said triangular modes in transport through open BLG cavities connected to leads. We show that the triangular symmetry translates into anisotropic transport and present an optimal setup for experimental detection of the triangular modes as well as for controlled modulation of transport in preferred directions.

Abstract: We study the radiative heat transfer through a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain of plasmonic InSb nanoparticles in close vicinity of an InSb substrate. We show how the frequency bands of the in- plane and out-of-plane modes in the chain are deformed by the coupling to the surface waves in the InSb substrate by considering different carrier concentrations. By calculating the Zak phase we show that also in the presence of the substrate there is a topological phase transition and that topologically protected edge modes emerge for finite chains. Finally, we demonstrate the long-range heat transport along the chain due to the coupling to the surface waves of the sample. We find an enhanced heat transfer in the topological non-trivial phase compared to the trivial phase due to the contribution of the edge modes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that bulk nonlinear responses in materials with multifold fermions, such as those in space group 213 and 199, can be leveraged for nonlinear valley-tronics, demonstrating the potential for differential addressing of low-energy excitations through transport measurements.

Abstract: Transport measurements are a powerful way to probe the electronic structure of quantum materials, but the information they contain is often convoluted. Yet, in particular for simple low-energy fermiologies, and by combining linear and non-linear responses, definite conclusion can be drawn -- such as, for instance, in the case of the circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. Here, we derive the complete DC intrinsic transport response functions up to third order in the applied electric field within Boltzmann theory that hold combined information about quantum geometry and band dispersion. We discuss the responses for multifold fermions at high-symmetry momenta in time-reversal symmetric crystals as well as their reduction by symmetry constraints. We exemplify in detail the cases of space group 213 and space group 199, which realize different multifold fermions, and show under which conditions these low-energy excitations can be differentially addressed through their bulk nonlinear responses, enabling nonlinear valley-tronics.

Motivation: The research aims to explore the possibility of ordered states in high-energy quantum and classical systems due to entropic effects, challenging the conventional understanding of symmetry breaking at low temperatures.

Method: The authors employ a large-flavor expansion and numerical simulations to analyze the high-temperature ordered phases in the classical and quantum Arithmetic Ising Models (AIM). Additionally, they introduce classical gas models to explore high-temperature crystallization driven by interactions.

Result: The findings reveal that both the classical and quantum Arithmetic Ising Models exhibit ordered high-temperature phases. The classical gas models also demonstrate crystallization at high temperatures, driven by their interactions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that generic high-energy states in quantum or classical systems can exhibit order due to entropic effects, leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking at high temperatures. The Arithmetic Ising Model (AIM) and its quantum analogue, along with classical gas models, serve as minimal examples of this phenomenon.

Abstract: Due to entropic effects, it is possible that generic high-energy states of a quantum or classical system are ordered. This leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking at arbitrarily high temperatures. We present minimal models of entropic order that arise from very simple interactions. Our main examples are the Arithmetic Ising Model (AIM) and its quantum analogue, where usual Ising spins are replaced by non-negative integers. Using a large-flavor expansion together with numerical simulations, we find that the high-temperature phase is ordered in the classical and quantum models. We also introduce classical gas models whose interactions drive the system to a crystal at high temperatures.

Abstract: A large family of multispin interacting one-dimensional quantum spin models with $Z(N)$ symmetry and a free-particle eigenspectra are known in the literature. They are free-fermionic ($N=2$) and free-parafermionic ($N\geq 2$) quantum chains. The essential ingredient that implies the free-particle spectra is the fact that these Hamiltonians are expressed in terms of generators of a $Z(N)$ exchange algebra. In all these known quantum chains the number of spins in all the multispin interactions (range of interactions) is the same and therefore, the models have homogeneous interacting range. In this paper we extend the $Z(N)$ exchange algebra, by introducing new models with a free-particle spectra, where the interaction ranges of the multispin interactions are not uniform anymore and depends on the lattice sites (non-homogeneous interacting range). We obtain the general conditions that the site-dependent ranges of the multispin interactions have to satisfy to ensure a free-particle spectra. Several simple examples are introduced. We study in detail the critical properties in the case where the range of interactions of the even (odd) sites are constant. The dynamical critical exponent is evaluated in several cases.

Motivation: To address the limitations of current models that assume memoryless dynamics and no coupling of internal active forces to the environment.

Method: Introduces a general theoretical framework incorporating internal state dynamics and environmental sensing into active particle models.

Result: Demonstrates that when self-propulsion depends on internal variables with complex dynamics, environmental memory emerges, leading to new behaviours.

Conclusion: This framework bridges cell-scale activity and large-scale intelligent motion in cell assemblies, and opens the way to the quantitative analysis and design of systems ranging from synthetic colloids to biological collectives and robotic swarms.

Abstract: Active systems across scales, ranging from molecular machines to human crowds, are usually modeled as assemblies of self-propelled particles driven by internally generated forces. However, these models often assume memoryless dynamics and no coupling of internal active forces to the environment. Here, guided by the example of living cells, which have recently been shown to display multi-timescale memory effects, we introduce a general theoretical framework that goes beyond this paradigm by incorporating internal state dynamics and environmental sensing into active particle models. We show that when the self-propulsion of an agent depends on internal variables with their own complex dynamics - modulated by local environmental cues - environmental memory spontaneously emerges and gives rise to new classes of behaviours. These include memory-induced responses, adaptable localization in complex landscapes, suppression of motility-induced phase separation, and enhanced jamming transitions. Our results demonstrate how minimal information processing capabilities, intrinsic to non-equilibrium agents with internal states like living cells, can profoundly influence both individual and collective behaviours. This framework bridges cell-scale activity and large-scale intelligent motion in cell assemblies, and opens the way to the quantitative analysis and design of systems ranging from synthetic colloids to biological collectives and robotic swarms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand noise-induced transitions in a stochastic system with nonreciprocal interactions, specifically focusing on the formation of Escher cycles and the geometric mechanisms underlying such transitions.

Method: The authors analytically calculate the quasipotential to first order in nonreciprocality, characterize it along a one-dimensional reaction coordinate, and obtain the full two-dimensional landscape using perturbation theory.

Result: The constructed quasipotential landscape features flat regions, extended plateaus, and non-differentiable switching lines, arising from handover of dominance between transition paths and competition between basins of attraction.

Conclusion: The study provides a rare and analytically tractable example of a quasipotential in more than one coordinate, revealing rich nonequilibrium features and singular structures in the landscape.

Abstract: We present an explicit construction of the Freidlin-Wentzell quasipotential of a stochastic system with two degrees of freedom and nonreciprocal interactions. This model undergoes noise-induced transitions between four metastable attractors, forming recurrent but aperiodic ``Escher cycles,'' similar to the cyclic nucleation dynamics observed in the nonreciprocal Ising model. We calculate the quasipotential analytically to first order in nonreciprocality. We characterise it along a one-dimensional reaction coordinate that connects the attractors, and we also obtain the full two-dimensional landscape, at leading order in perturbation theory. The resulting landscapes feature flat regions and extended plateaus, together with non-differentiable switching lines. These singular structures arise from two geometric mechanisms: the handover of dominance between competing transition paths, and the competition between basins of attraction. The system provides a rare case where the geometry of nonequilibrium rare events can be fully resolved, and a simple analytically tractable example of a quasipotential in more than one coordinate that captures a rich set of nonequilibrium features.

### [32] [Supercritical-subcritical correspondence, asymmetric effects and antisymmetric corrections near a critical point](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08553)
*Xinyang Li,Yuliang Jin*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of asymmetry on scaling laws in critical phenomena, extending the study to supercritical regimes, and validates predictions with data and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of asymmetry on scaling laws in critical phenomena, particularly focusing on violations of the rectilinear diameter law in the subcritical regime and extending this to the supercritical regime.

Method: The paper extends the investigation of asymmetry effects to the supercritical regime by proposing a supercritical-subcritical correspondence and utilizes liquid-gas data from the NIST database and a model liquid-liquid transition to verify predictions.

Result: The theory predicts universal scaling corrections with antisymmetric coefficients in supercritical loci, validated by empirical data and model simulations, showing consistency in higher-order cumulant behavior.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the asymmetric scaling framework, governing the behavior of higher-order cumulants, is universally applicable to both subcritical and supercritical regimes, bridging a gap in understanding critical phenomena.

Abstract: The second-order phase transitions in the Ising model and liquid-gas systems share a universality class and critical exponents, despite the absence of $Z_2$ symmetry in the liquid-gas Hamiltonian. This discrepancy highlights a central puzzle in critical phenomena: what is the influence of asymmetry on scaling laws? For over a century, this question has been explored through examining violations of the empirical ``rectilinear diameter law'' for the subcritical coexistence curve, where asymmetry could generate singular corrections. Here, we extend this investigation to the supercritical regime. We propose a supercritical-subcritical correspondence, drawing a formal analogy between the subcritical coexistence curve and recently defined supercritical boundary lines ($L^\pm$ lines). Our theory predicts that the linear mixing of physical fields - a hallmark of asymmetric systems - produces universal scaling corrections, with antisymmetric coefficients, in these supercritical loci. We verify these predictions using liquid-gas data from the NIST database and a model liquid-liquid transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same asymmetric scaling framework governs the behavior of higher-order cumulants in the order parameter distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the relationship between active wetting in self-propelled particles and equilibrium wetting.

Method: An exact (noiseless) hydrodynamic framework for an active lattice gas, using a slit geometry with periodic boundary conditions.

Result: Identified fully- and partially-wet states with a critical wetting transition, and discovered a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking ratchet current in the partially wet state.

Conclusion: The study establishes a direct link between active and equilibrium wetting while highlighting the nonequilibrium effects of activity.

Abstract: Self-propelled particles accumulate on repulsive barriers in so-called active wetting, but the relationship between this process and equilibrium wetting remains unclear. Using an exact (noiseless) hydrodynamic framework for an active lattice gas, we show, using a slit geometry with periodic boundary conditions, that active matter exhibits both fully- and partially-wet states, with a critical wetting transition between them. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking ratchet current in the partially wet state, leading to departure of the bulk densities from their binodal values and the emergence of a novel dynamical pathway for the full-to-partial wetting transition. We elucidate this modified dynamical pathway using a minimal model. The results, while establishing a direct connection between active and equilibrium wetting, also identify the nonequilibrium consequences of activity.

Motivation: To study thermodynamic properties and dynamic phase space behavior of hydrogen isotopologues at cryogenic temperatures and high density.

Method: Infrared and Raman spectroscopy were employed to investigate Q$_2$ behavior in different phases, ortho/para states, and under varying temperatures (10 K - 300 K) and pressures (up to 2.5 bar). A tritium-compatible cryostat with optical access was designed and tested.

Conclusion: The T$_2$ApIR experiment is successfully commissioned and ready for integration into the TLK closed-loop tritium infrastructure, demonstrating its capability to study hydrogen isotopologues under various conditions.

Abstract: To study thermodynamic properties and dynamic phase space behavior of hydrogen isotopologues (Q$_2$) at cryogenic temperatures and at high density, the Tritium Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy 2 (T$_2$ApIR) experiment has been set up and commissioned at Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK). In the frame of the experiment, Q$_2$ behavior in different phases, ortho/para states, temperatures (10 K - 300 K) and pressures (up to 2.5 bar a) will be investigated with optical methods, infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The facility consists of a fully tritium compatible cryostat, which includes an optical cell, ortho/para converter and windows for optical and spectroscopic studies. The cryostat can be cooled below the H$_2$ triple point by a two-stage cryocooler and contains openings in the cryogenic shielding for the optical access. The challenge of combining these scientific requirements in a design with high amounts of tritium (14 g), in a limited space, all while maintaining the TLK safety philosophy was solved by the presented design. The experiment is ready to be fully integrated into the TLK closed loop tritium infrastructure. This contribution reports a comprehensive overview of the commissioning phase of the experimental facility and the results of the first commissioning experiments, including cryogenic performance tests, commissioning experiments with non-radioactive gases, and tests of the analytical instruments.

### [35] [Langevin equation with potential of mean force: The case of anchored bath](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08793)
*Alex V. Plyukhin*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The study reveals that the PMF in non-equilibrium systems complicates the Langevin equation by coupling noise and dissipation to the system's position, but this issue is resolved for linear forces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to understand how the potential of mean force (PMF) behaves in non-equilibrium scenarios described by a generalized Langevin equation, particularly when the PMF is influenced by interactions with a thermal bath.

Method: The researchers used a model where the system is a single particle and the bath includes on-site potentials, focusing on the Klein-Gordon chain as a specific example of a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials.

Result: The results showed that the PMF does not simply replace the external potential but also affects the dissipation kernel and noise properties, making the Langevin equation generally inoperable unless the forces are linear.

Conclusion: The study concludes that in systems with linear forces, the dependence of the dissipation kernel and noise properties on the system's position can be canceled, making the Langevin equation operable with a quadratic PMF.

Abstract: The potential of mean force (PMF) is an effective average potential acting on an open system, renormalized due to the interaction with the surrounding thermal bath. The PMF is defined for an equilibrium ensemble, and generally it is not clear how to use it when the system is out of equilibrium and described by a (generalized) Langevin equation. We study a model where the system is a single particle (so there are no complications related to internal forces) and a non-trivial PMF is due to the presence of on-site (anchor) potentials applied to the bath particles. We found that the PMF does not merely replace the external potential, but also makes the dissipation kernel and statistical properties of noise dependent on the system's position. That dependence is determined by the internal bath and system-bath interactions and is a priori unknown. Therefore, in the general case the Langevin equation with the PMF is not closed and thus inoperable. However, for systems with linear forces the aforementioned dependence on the system's position may be canceled. As an example, we consider a model where the bath is formed by the Klein-Gordon chain, i. e. a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials. In that case, the generalized Langevin equation has the standard form with an external potential replaced by a quadratic PMF.

TL;DR: QCRM extends VQCs to logical reasoning, mapping quantum operations to reasoning primitives, and introduces a differentiable hybrid framework (QRL) for scientific and biomedical inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the natural mapping of quantum mechanical operations (superposition, entanglement, interference, measurement) to reasoning primitives (hypothesis branching, constraint propagation, consistency enforcement, decision making), enabling a quantum-inspired approach to reasoning tasks.

Method: Develops a novel class of reasoning architectures, QCRM, by extending Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) to include logical inference and reasoning. The method involves encoding logical rules as unitary transformations and using gradient descent for optimization.

Result: The result is a differentiable hybrid framework (Quantum Reasoning Layer, QRL) that combines quantum-inspired computation with classical optimization, applicable to various inference domains.

Conclusion: The QCRM framework successfully integrates quantum mechanical operations with reasoning primitives, demonstrating its potential for structured logical inference and reasoning, with promising applications in scientific and biomedical domains.

Abstract: This report introduces a novel class of reasoning architectures, termed Quantum Circuit Reasoning Models (QCRM), which extend the concept of Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) from energy minimization and classification tasks to structured logical inference and reasoning. We posit that fundamental quantum mechanical operations, superposition, entanglement, interference, and measurement, naturally map to essential reasoning primitives such as hypothesis branching, constraint propagation, consistency enforcement, and decision making. The resulting framework combines quantum-inspired computation with differentiable optimization, enabling reasoning to emerge as a process of amplitude evolution and interference-driven selection of self-consistent states. We develop the mathematical foundation of QCRM, define its parameterized circuit architecture, and show how logical rules can be encoded as unitary transformations over proposition-qubit states. We further formalize a training objective grounded in classical gradient descent over circuit parameters and discuss simulation-based implementations on classical hardware. Finally, we propose the Quantum Reasoning Layer (QRL) as a differentiable hybrid component for composable reasoning models applicable to scientific, biomedical, and chemical inference domains.

Motivation: To provide a real, grade-preserving algebraic framework for N-qubit quantum computation that aligns symbolic Clifford multiplication with unitary evolution.

Method: Introduces a real algebraic framework based on Cℓ₂,₀(ℝ)^⊗N, where bivector J supplies the complex structure and Pauli operations arise from Clifford elements. A canonical stabilizer mapping represents the computational basis state |0⋯0⟩ using tensor products of real algebraic idempotents.

Result: Develops a State-Operator Clifford Compatibility law stable under the geometric product for N qubits, ensuring compatibility with unitary evolution.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a real, grade-preserving algebraic framework for N-qubit quantum computation using the tensor product structure Cℓ₂,₀(ℝ)^⊗N, aligning Clifford multiplication with unitary evolution.

Abstract: We revisit the Pauli-Clifford connection to introduce a real, grade-preserving algebraic framework for $N$-qubit quantum computation based on the tensor product structure $C\ell_{2,0}(\mathbb{R})^{\otimes N}$. In this setting the bivector $J = e_{12}$ satisfies $J^{2} = -1$ and supplies the complex structure on a minimal left ideal via right-multiplication, while Pauli operations arise as left actions of suitable Clifford elements. Adopting a canonical stabilizer mapping, the $N$-qubit computational basis state $|0\cdots 0\rangle$ is represented natively by a tensor product of real algebraic idempotents. This structural choice leads to a State-Operator Clifford Compatibility law that is stable under the geometric product for $N$ qubits and aligns symbolic Clifford multiplication with unitary evolution on the Hilbert space.

Motivation: To understand the physical mechanism that enables quantum catalysis to enhance quantum battery performance in open systems, particularly by countering dephasing losses.

Method: The research investigates an external-field-driven qubit quantum battery (QB) coupled to a harmonic oscillator catalyst, analyzing the thermodynamic mechanism involving transient negative heat flow.

Result: The catalyst induces transient negative heat flow (energy backflow) into the battery, which counters dephasing losses and significantly enhances extractable work (Ergotropy).

Conclusion: This study reveals the fundamental role of transient thermodynamic backflow in quantum catalysis, highlighting its importance for designing high-performance quantum energy storage devices.

Abstract: What physical mechanism enables quantum catalysis to boost quantum battery (QB) performance in open systems? We investigate an external-field-driven qubit QB coupled to a harmonic oscillator catalyst, revealing a key thermodynamic mechanism: the catalyst induces transient negative heat flow ($J(t)<0$, or energy backflow) into the battery. This backflow actively counters dephasing losses, rapidly pushing the qubit into non-passive states, and results in a drastic enhancement of extractable work (Ergotropy). Leveraging the quantum first law, we precisely quantify this causal link between negative heat flux and QB performance enhancement. Our work uncovers the fundamental role of transient thermodynamic backflow in quantum catalysis, offering a crucial blueprint for high-performance quantum energy storage devices.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个统一框架，既包含了现有稳定子码（如量子比特和量子dit稳定子码），又为特定系统设计对称感知码提供了便利。

Abstract: Typical stabilizer codes aim to solve the general problem of fault-tolerance without regard for the structure of a specific system. By incorporating a broader representation-theoretic perspective, we provide a generalized framework that allows the code designer to take this structure into account. For any representation of a finite group, we produce a quantum code with a code space invariant under the group action, providing passive error mitigation against errors belonging to the image of the representation. Furthermore, errors outside this scope are detected and diagnosed by performing a projective measurement onto the isotypic components corresponding to irreducible representations of the chosen group, effectively generalizing syndrome extraction to symmetry-resolved quantum measurements. We show that all stabilizer codes are a special case of this construction, including qudit stabilizer codes, and show that there is a natural one logical qubit code associated to the dihedral group. Thus we provide a unifying framework for existing codes while simultaneously facilitating symmetry-aware codes tailored to specific systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed framework for fair benchmarking of quantum optimization ensures reproducibility, comparability, and trust in reported results, addressing the limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: Quantum optimisation is emerging as a promising approach alongside classical heuristics and specialised hardware, yet its performance is often difficult to assess fairly. Traditional benchmarking methods, rooted in digital complexity theory, do not directly capture the continuous dynamics, probabilistic outcomes, and workflow overheads of quantum and hybrid systems. This paper proposes principles and protocols for fair benchmarking of quantum optimisation, emphasising end-to-end workflows, transparency in tuning and reporting, problem diversity, and avoidance of speculative claims. By extending lessons from classical benchmarking and incorporating application-driven and energy-aware metrics, we outline a framework that enables practitioners to evaluate quantum methods responsibly, ensuring reproducibility, comparability, and trust in reported results.

Abstract: Quantum computing offers the promise of speedups for scientific computations, but its application to reacting flows is hindered by nonlinear source terms and the challenges of time-dependent simulations. We present a quantum framework to address these issues. We employ a probability density function (PDF) formulation to transform the nonlinear reacting-flow governing equations into high-dimensional linear ones. The entire temporal evolution is then solved as a single large linear system using the history state method, which avoids the measurement bottleneck of conventional time-marching schemes and fully leverages the advantages of quantum linear system algorithms. To extract the quantity of interest from the resulting quantum state, we develop an efficient algorithm to measure the statistical moments of the PDF, bypassing the need for costly full-state tomography. A computational complexity analysis indicates the potential for a near-exponential speedup over classical algorithms. We validate the framework by simulating a perfectly stirred reactor, demonstrating its capability to capture the PDF evolution and statistics of a nonlinear reactive system. This work establishes a pathway for applying quantum computing to nonlinear reacting flows.

Motivation: To address scalability issues in cryogenic quantum processors by reducing decoherence and quasiparticle poisoning, while improving qubit control fidelity.

Method: The researchers optimized the qubit design and control lines for 2D transmon devices, comparing qubit lifetime, coherence time, and gate fidelity between Josephson pulse generator (JPG) circuits and traditional semiconductor control electronics (TSCE). They also performed interleaved randomized benchmarking.

Result: The JPG circuit showed agreement with TSCE within daily fluctuations for qubit lifetime and coherence time, and within 10% for randomized benchmarking. The average error per gate was 0.46%, an order of magnitude improvement over previous work.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a Josephson microwave source operated at 3 K offers significant improvements in qubit control fidelity and coherence, making it a promising solution for scalable quantum computing.

Abstract: Compared to traditional semiconductor control electronics (TSCE) located at room temperature, cryogenic single flux quantum (SFQ) electronics can provide qubit measurement and control alternatives that address critical issues related to scalability of cryogenic quantum processors. Single-qubit control and readout have been demonstrated recently using SFQ circuits coupled to superconducting qubits. Experiments where the SFQ electronics are co-located with the qubit have suffered from excess decoherence and loss due to quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit. A previous experiment by our group showed that moving the control electronics to the 3 K stage of the dilution refrigerator avoided this source of decoherence in a high-coherence 3D transmon geometry. In this paper, we also generate the pulses at the 3 K stage but have optimized the qubit design and control lines for scalable 2D transmon devices. We directly compare the qubit lifetime $T_1$, coherence time $T_2^*$ and gate fidelity when the qubit is controlled by the Josephson pulse generator (JPG) circuit versus the TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations for $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, and agreement to within 10% for randomized benchmarking. We also performed interleaved randomized benchmarking on individual JPG gates demonstrating an average error per gate of $0.46$% showing good agreement with what is expected based on the qubit coherence and higher-state leakage. These results are an order of magnitude improvement in gate fidelity over our previous work and demonstrate that a Josephson microwave source operated at 3 K is a promising component for scalable qubit control.

Abstract: We present a framework for efficient extraction of the viscosity solutions of nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations with convex Hamiltonians. These viscosity solutions play a central role in areas such as front propagation, mean-field games, optimal control, machine learning, and a direct application to the forced Burgers' equation. Our method is based on an entropy penalisation method proposed by Gomes and Valdinoci, which generalises the Cole-Hopf transform from quadratic to general convex Hamiltonians, allowing a reformulation of viscous Hamilton-Jacobi dynamics by a discrete-time linear dynamics which approximates a linear heat-like parabolic equation, and can also extend to continuous-time dynamics. This makes the method suitable for quantum simulation. The validity of these results hold for arbitrary nonlinearity that correspond to convex Hamiltonians, and for arbitrarily long times, thus obviating a chief obstacle in most quantum algorithms for nonlinear partial differential equations. We provide quantum algorithms, both analog and digital, for extracting pointwise values, gradients, minima, and function evaluations at the minimiser of the viscosity solution, without requiring nonlinear updates or full state reconstruction.

Conclusion: The results establish van der Waals (vdW) materials as a viable platform for compact superconducting quantum devices, with potential for improved performance and new functionalities.

Abstract: State-of-the-art superconducting qubits rely on a limited set of thin-film materials. Expanding their materials palette can improve performance, extend operating regimes, and introduce new functionalities, but conventional thin-film fabrication hinders systematic exploration of new material combinations. Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer a highly modular crystalline platform that facilitates such exploration while enabling gate-tunability, higher-temperature operation, and compact qubit geometries. Yet it remains unknown whether a fully vdW superconducting qubit can support quantum coherence and what mechanisms dominate loss at both low and elevated temperatures in such a device. Here we demonstrate quantum-coherent merged-element transmons made entirely from vdW Josephson junctions. These first-generation, fully crystalline qubits achieve microsecond lifetimes in an ultra-compact footprint without external shunt capacitors. Energy relaxation measurements, together with microwave characterization of vdW capacitors, point to dielectric loss as the dominant relaxation channel up to hundreds of millikelvin. These results establish vdW materials as a viable platform for compact superconducting quantum devices.

Abstract: Photons are bosons, and yet, when prepared in specific entangled states, they can exhibit non-bosonic behaviour. While this phenomenon has so far been studied in two-photon systems, exchange symmetries and interference effects in multi-photon scenarios remain largely unexplored. In this work, we show that multi-photon states uncover a rich landscape of exchange symmetries. With three photons already, multiple pairwise combinations are possible, where each pair of photons can exhibit either bosonic, fermionic, or anyonic exchange symmetry. This gives rise to mixed symmetry systems that are not possible to achieve with two photon alone. We experimentally investigate how these symmetry configurations manifest themselves in the observed interference of three photons. We show that multi-photon interference can be effectively turned on and off by tuning the symmetry of the constituent pairs. The possibility of accessing and tuning new quantum statistics in a scalable photonic platform not only deepens our understanding of quantum systems, but is also highly relevant for quantum technologies that rely on quantum interference.

Motivation: To experimentally resolve novel non-equilibrium phase transitions in quantum many-body dynamics, which were previously challenging due to limitations in measurement fidelity and feedback latency.

Method: The researchers developed a superconducting quantum processor capable of global mid-circuit measurement with high fidelity (98.7%) and fast conditional feedback (200 ns latency). They utilized this platform to study absorbing-state and measurement-induced entanglement transitions.

Result: The experiments confirmed the coexistence of an absorbing-state transition and a measurement-induced entanglement transition, with critical exponents for the absorbing-state transition aligning with the directed percolation universality class. The two transitions occurred at distinct parameter values.

Conclusion: The developed superconducting quantum processor with high-fidelity mid-circuit measurements and fast feedback operations provides a powerful platform for exploring non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics, demonstrating the coexistence of distinct phase transitions in quantum circuits.

Abstract: Mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations conditioned on the measurement outcomes are essential for implementing quantum error-correction on quantum hardware. When integrated in quantum many-body dynamics, they can give rise to novel non-equilibrium phase transitions both at the level of each individual quantum trajectory and the averaged quantum channel. Experimentally resolving both transitions on realistic devices has been challenging due to limitations on the fidelity and the significant latency for performing mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations in real time. Here, we develop a superconducting quantum processor that enables global mid-circuit measurement with an average quantum non-demolition (QND) fidelity of 98.7% and fast conditional feedback with a 200 ns real-time decision latency. Using this platform, we demonstrate the coexistence of an absorbing-state transition in the quantum channel and a measurement-induced entanglement transition at the level of individual quantum trajectories. For the absorbing-state transition, we experimentally extract a set of critical exponents at the transition point, which is in excellent agreement with the directed percolation universality class. Crucially, the two transitions occur at distinct values of the tuning parameter. Our results demonstrate that adaptive quantum circuits provide a powerful platform for exploring non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics.

We develop a dynamical characterization of null-result weak measurements that quantifies the information extracted over time, revealing the amount of the obtained information and also the rate of the information accumulation. The characterizations are obtained by examining the time-dependent evolution of the information theoretic quantities. More specifically, we consider Shannon entropy, mutual information, fidelity, and relative entropy to characterize the weak measurement dynamics. Our results provide an information theoretic analysis of the weak measurement process and highlight the dynamical nature of information extraction and reversibility in the weak measurement processes.

Abstract: Tunable Josephson harmonics open up for new qubit design. We demonstrate a superconducting circuit element with a tunnel junction in series with a SQUID loop, yielding a highly magnetic-flux tunable harmonic content of the Josephson potential. We analyze spectroscopy of the first four qubit transitions with a circuit model which includes the internal mode, revealing a second harmonic up to $\sim10\%$ of the fundamental harmonic. Interestingly, a sweet spot where the dispersive shift vanishes is achieved by balancing the dispersive couplings to the internal and qubit modes. The highly tunable set-up provides a route toward protected qubits, and customizable nonlinear microwave devices.

Abstract: We present a classical and quantum analysis of a particle confined in a three-dimensional paraboloidal cavity formed by two confocal paraboloids. Classically, the system is integrable and presents three independent constants of motion, namely, the energy, the $z$-component of the angular momentum, and a third dynamical constant associated with the paraboloidal geometry, which can be derived from the separability of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation. We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the actions, which allow us to determine the two conditions to get periodic closed trajectories. We classify these trajectories through the indices $(s,t,\ell)$. The caustic paraboloids that bound the motion provide a complete geometric characterization of admissible trajectories. Quantum mechanically, separability of the Schrödinger equation in parabolic coordinates yields eigenmodes described by Whittaker functions. We determine the energy spectrum and identify degeneracies arising not only from azimuthal symmetry but also from specific cavity deformations. A direct correspondence between classical trajectories and quantum eigenstates reveals that probability densities concentrate in the classically allowed region with controlled penetration into forbidden zones.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the existing construction of quantum double models for abelian groups to non-abelian groups by leveraging their boundary symmetries through a systematic gauging procedure, and to explore higher-dimensional extensions.

Method: The authors use a categorical gauging framework based on matrix product operators (MPOs) to derive the gauging procedure for the $	ext{Rep} G$ symmetries and provide an explicit description of the dual emergent $G$ symmetry. They also propose a gauging procedure for 1-form $	ext{Rep} G$ symmetries on a two-dimensional lattice.

Result: The paper successfully reconstructs (2+1)D quantum double models for finite groups using boundary symmetries and extends the results to (3+1)D models via iterative gauging. It also connects gapped boundaries to quantum phases of the input state.

Conclusion: This paper successfully extends the construction of (2+1)D quantum double models to non-abelian groups using a categorical gauging framework, and further proposes a method to construct (3+1)D quantum double models through iterative gauging. The key contribution is the explicit derivation of the dual emergent symmetry and the connection between gapped boundaries and quantum phases.

Abstract: We reconstruct all (2+1)D quantum double models of finite groups from their boundary symmetries through the repeated application of a gauging procedure, extending the existing construction for abelian groups. We employ the recently proposed categorical gauging framework, based on matrix product operators (MPOs), to derive the appropriate gauging procedure for the $\mathsf{Rep}\, G$ symmetries appearing in our construction and give an explicit description of the dual emergent $G$ symmetry, which is our main technical contribution. Furthermore, we relate the possible gapped boundaries of the quantum double models to the quantum phases of the one-dimensional input state to the iterated gauging procedure. Finally, we propose a gauging procedure for 1-form $\mathsf{Rep}\, G$ symmetries on a two-dimensional lattice and use it to extend our results to the construction of (3+1)D quantum doubles models through the iterative gauging of (2+1)-dimensional symmetries.

Motivation: The challenge of compiling shallow and accurate quantum circuits for Hamiltonian simulation due to hardware constraints and combinatorial complexity necessitates a learning-based approach to exploit input-dependent structure.

Method: F2 uses an offline reinforcement learning framework with a reinforcement-learning environment, architectural and objective-level inductive biases, and a reversible synthetic-trajectory generation mechanism.

Result: F2 reduces gate count by 47% and circuit depth by 38% on average across benchmarks while maintaining low errors of 10^-7.

Conclusion: F2 demonstrates that aligning deep reinforcement learning with the algebraic structure of quantum dynamics significantly improves circuit synthesis, offering scalable and efficient quantum compilation.

Abstract: Compiling shallow and accurate quantum circuits for Hamiltonian simulation remains challenging due to hardware constraints and the combinatorial complexity of minimizing gate count and circuit depth. Existing optimization method pipelines rely on hand-engineered classical heuristics, which cannot learn input-dependent structure and therefore miss substantial opportunities for circuit reduction.
  We introduce \textbf{F2}, an offline reinforcement learning framework that exploits free-fermionic structure to efficiently compile Trotter-based Hamiltonian simulation circuits. F2 provides (i) a reinforcement-learning environment over classically simulatable free-fermionic subroutines, (ii) architectural and objective-level inductive biases that stabilize long-horizon value learning, and (iii) a reversible synthetic-trajectory generation mechanism that consistently yields abundant, guaranteed-successful offline data.
  Across benchmarks spanning lattice models, protein fragments, and crystalline materials (12-222 qubits), F2 reduces gate count by 47\% and depth by 38\% on average relative to strong baselines (Qiskit, Cirq/OpenFermion) while maintaining average errors of $10^{-7}$. These results show that aligning deep reinforcement learning with the algebraic structure of quantum dynamics enables substantial improvements in circuit synthesis, suggesting a promising direction for scalable, learning-based quantum compilation

Abstract: We explore the influence of geometry in the critical behavior of sparse long-range spin models. We examine a model with interactions that can be continuously tuned to induce distinct changes in the metric, topology, and dimensionality of the coupling graph. This underlying geometry acts as the driver of criticality, with structural changes in the graph coinciding with and dictating the phase boundaries. We further discuss how this framework connects naturally to realizations in tweezer arrays with Rydberg excitations. In certain cases, the effective geometry can be incorporated in the layout of atoms in tweezers to realize phase transitions that preserve universal features, simplifying their implementation in near-term experiments.

Abstract: We introduce a driven-dissipative Floquet model in which a single harmonic oscillator with modulated frequency and decay realizes a non-Hermitian synthetic lattice with an effective electric field gradient in frequency space. Using the Floquet-Green's function and its doubled-space representation, we identify a topological regime that supports directional amplification and frequency conversion, accurately captured by a local winding number. The underlying mode structure is well described by a Jackiw-Rebbi-like continuum theory with Dirac cones and solitonic zero modes in synthetic frequency. Our results establish a simple and experimentally feasible route to non-Hermitian topological amplification, naturally implementable in current quantum technologies such as superconducting circuits.

Abstract: Controlled quantum mechanical motion of trapped atomic ions can be used to simulate and explore collective quantum phenomena and to process quantum information. Groups of cold atomic ions in an externally applied trapping potential self-organize into "Coulomb crystals" due to their mutual electrostatic repulsion. The motion of the ions in these crystals is strongly coupled, and the eigenmodes of motion all involve multiple ions. While this enables studies of many-body physics, it limits the flexibility and tunability of the system as a quantum platform. Here, we demonstrate an array of trapped ions in individual trapping sites whose motional modes can be controllably coupled and decoupled by tuning the local applied confining potential for each ion. We show that a single motional quantum, or phonon, can be coherently shared among two or three ions confined at the vertices of an equilateral triangle 30 $μ$m on a side. We can adiabatically tune the ion participation in the motional modes around a closed contour in configuration space, observing that the single-phonon wavefunction acquires a topological Berry phase if the contour encircles a conical intersection of motional eigenvalue surfaces. We observe this phase by single-phonon interference and study its breakdown as the motional mode tuning becomes non-adiabiatic. Our results show that precise, individual quantum control of ion motion in a two-dimensional array can provide unique access to quantum multi-body effects.

TL;DR: The paper generalizes Gleason's Theorem to non-spacelike separated quantum systems using local-density operators and Dirac measures, advancing the theory of quantum correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underdevelopment of mathematical theory for quantum correlations between non-spacelike separated systems.

Method: Development of the theory of 'local-density operators' and proving their one-to-one correspondence with 'Dirac measures'.

Result: A generalized version of Gleason's Theorem applicable to non-spacelike separated systems, unifying quantum correlations in both space and time.

Conclusion: The study extends Gleason's Theorem to non-spacelike separated systems, providing a mathematical framework for quantum correlations across space and time.

Abstract: Quantum correlations often defy an explanation in terms of fundamental notions of classical physics, such as causality, locality, and realism. While the mathematical theory underpinning quantum correlations between spacelike separated systems has been well-established since the 1930s, the mathematical theory for correlations between non-spacelike separated systems is much less developed. In this work, we develop the theory of what we refer to as "local-density operators", which we view as joint states for possibly non-spacelike separated quantum systems. Local-density operators are unit trace operators whose marginals are genuine density operators, which we show not only subsumes the notion of density operator, but also several extensions of the notion of density operator into the spatiotemporal domain, such as pseudo-density operators and quantum states over time. More importantly, we prove a result which establishes a one-to-one correspondence between local-density operators and what we refer to as "Dirac measures", which are complex-valued measures on the space of separable projectors associated with two quantum systems. In the case that one of the systems is the trivial quantum system with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, our result recovers the fundamental result known as Gleason's Theorem, which implies that the Born rule from quantum theory is the only way in which one may assign probabilities to the outcomes of measurements performed on quantum systems in a non-contextual manner. As such, our results establish a direct generalization of Gleason's Theorem to measurements performed on possibly non-spacelike separated systems, thus extending the mathematical theory of quantum correlations across space to quantum correlations across space and time.

Motivation: To understand and quantify the role of memory in feedback-control dynamics for quantum systems, and to develop a general framework for analyzing such systems.

Method: Investigates a general memory function coupled to a quantum system, using hybrid bipartite states and information-theoretic measures to quantify correlations.

Result: Shows that memory can be treated as a classical system coupled to the quantum system, and introduces measures for correlations and statistical properties of the memory.

Conclusion: The framework provides a unified approach to analyze feedback-control protocols and monitored quantum systems, demonstrating practical applications in stabilizing quantum states.

Abstract: Feedback uses past detection outcomes to dynamically modify a quantum system and is central to quantum control. These outcomes can be stored in a memory, defined as a stochastic function of past measurements. In this work, we investigate the main properties of a general memory function subject to arbitrary feedback dynamics. We show that the memory can be treated as a classical system coupled to the monitored quantum system, and that their joint evolution is described by a hybrid bipartite state. This framework allows us to introduce information-theoretic measures that quantify the correlations between the system and the memory. Furthermore, we develop a general framework to characterize the statistics of the memory -- such as moments, cumulants, and correlation functions -- which can be applied both to general feedback-control protocols and to monitored systems without feedback. As an application, we analyze feedback schemes based on detection events in a two-level system coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on protocols that stabilize either the excited-state population or Rabi oscillations against thermal dissipation.

Motivation: To explore the interconnected nature of time, space, and entanglement, and to understand how entanglement could underlie the emergence of time and space in quantum systems.

Method: The study revisits and extends the Page and Wootters theory, connects it with foundational research in statistical mechanics, and generalizes the framework to describe spatial degrees of freedom. It also examines quantum clocks in gravitational fields.

Result: A model of 3+1 dimensional quantum spacetime emerges from entanglement in a timeless and positionless Universe, with time dilation effects consistent with the Schwarzschild solution.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that entanglement could serve as the foundation for the emergence of time and space in closed quantum systems, extending the Page and Wootters theory to include spatial degrees of freedom and aligning with gravitational time dilation effects.

Abstract: Time, space and entanglement are the main characters in this work. Their nature is still a great mystery in physics and we study here the possibility that these three phenomena are closely connected, showing how entanglement can be at the basis of the emergence of time and space within closed quantum systems. We revisit and extend the Page and Wootters theory that was originally introduced in order to describe the emergence of time through entanglement between subsystems in a globally static, quantum Universe. In the book, after providing a complete review of the salient aspects of the theory, we establish a connection with recent research on the foundations of statistical mechanics and we propose a new understanding of the thermalization process. Furthermore, we generalize the framework in order describe the spatial degree of freedom and we provide a model of 3+1 dimensional, quantum spacetime emerging from entanglement among different subsystems in a globally "timeless" and "positionless" Universe. Finally, via the Page and Wootters theory, the evolution of quantum clocks within a gravitational field is treated and a time dilation effect is obtained in agreement with the Schwarzschild solution.

Result: The results demonstrate the effectiveness of weakly-coupled edges in achieving high-fidelity state transfer, circumventing Anderson localization in spin chains, and accelerating quantum search processes.

Conclusion: The paper rigorously proves the paradoxical idea that weakly-coupled edges can enable high-fidelity quantum state transfer, providing a foundational understanding and practical applications in quantum systems.

Abstract: A paradoxical idea in quantum transport is that attaching weakly-coupled edges to a large base graph creates high-fidelity quantum state transfer. We provide a mathematical treatment that rigorously prove this folklore idea. Our proofs are elementary and build upon the Feshbach-Schur method from perturbation theory.

Motivation: To understand the effects of incomplete and imperfect particle addressing in quantum systems and characterize the resulting coarse-grained states.

Method: Geometric arguments for two qubits and random-matrix methods for larger systems, complemented by Monte-Carlo simulations to validate analytical predictions.

Result: The probability density of obtaining a given coarse-grained state sharply concentrates around the maximally mixed state for larger systems. For two qubits, the preimage of the maximally mixed state includes a finite singlet component.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that coarse-graining in multipartite quantum systems leads to a sharp concentration around the maximally mixed state as the number of qubits increases, with nearly pure states becoming unlikely. For two-qubit systems, the preimage of the maximally mixed state contains a finite singlet component.

Abstract: We study a coarse-graining map arising from incomplete and imperfect addressing of particles in a multipartite quantum system. In its simplest form, corresponding to a two-qubit state, the resulting channel produces a convex mixture of the two partial traces. We derive the probability density of obtaining a given coarse-grained state, using geometric arguments for two qubits coarse-grained to one, and random-matrix methods for larger systems. As the number of qubits increases, the probability density sharply concentrates around the maximally mixed state, making nearly pure coarse-grained states increasingly unlikely. For two qubits, we also compute the inverse state needed to characterize the effective dynamics under coarse-graining and find that the average preimage of the maximally mixed state contains a finite singlet component. Finally, we validate the analytical predictions by inferring the underlying probabilities from Monte-Carlo-generated coarse-grained statistics.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a protocol for learning a time-independent Lindblad model for operations that can be applied repeatedly on a quantum computer. The protocol is highly scalable for models with local interactions and is in principle insensitive to state-preparation errors. At its core, the protocol forms a linear system of equations for the model parameters in terms of a set of observable values and their gradients. The required gradient information is obtained by fitting time-series data with sums of exponentially damped sinusoids and differentiating those curves. We develop a robust curve-fitting procedure that finds the most parsimonious representation of the data up to shot noise. We demonstrate the approach by learning the Lindbladian for a full layer of gates on a 156-qubit superconducting quantum processor, providing the first learning experiment of this kind. We study the effects of state-preparation and measurement errors and limitations on the operations that can be learned. For improved performance under readout errors, we propose an optional fine-tuning strategy that improves the fit between the time-evolved model and the measured data.

TL;DR: Optimising measurements (e.g., NLA/NA or POVMs) significantly improves quantum teleportation and superdense coding performance under channel losses, with feasible experimental implementations achieving optimal gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Channel losses degrade the shared entangled states in quantum communication protocols like teleportation and superdense coding, reducing fidelity and information advantage. The aim was to mitigate these effects by optimising the measurements applied by the communicating parties.

Method: The problem was formulated as an optimisation over general POVMs, and the results were compared with noiseless attenuation (NA) and noiseless linear amplification (NLA) circuits.

Result: For teleportation, NLA/NA and optimised POVMs improved average fidelity by up to 78% while maintaining feasible success probabilities. For superdense coding, they enhanced the quantum advantage over classical channel capacity by more than 100% in some regimes and extended the tolerable range of losses.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that optimising measurements, particularly through NLA and NA or general POVMs, significantly enhances the performance of quantum teleportation and superdense coding under channel losses. Simple, experimentally feasible operations like NLA/NA already achieve optimal performance gains.

Abstract: Quantum communication offers many applications, with teleportation and superdense coding being two of the most fundamental. In these protocols, pre-shared entanglement enables either the faithful transfer of quantum states or the transmission of more information than is possible classically. However, channel losses degrade the shared states, reducing teleportation fidelity and the information advantage in superdense coding. Here, we investigate how to mitigate these effects by optimising the measurements applied by the communicating parties. We formulate the problem as an optimisation over general positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) and compare the results with physically realisable noiseless attenuation (NA) and noiseless linear amplification (NLA) circuits. For teleportation, NLA/NA and optimised POVMs improve the average fidelity by up to 78% while maintaining feasible success probabilities. For superdense coding, they enhance the quantum advantage over the classical channel capacity by more than 100% in some regimes and shift the break-even point, thereby extending the tolerable range of losses. Notably, the optimal POVMs effectively reduce to NA or NLA, showing that simple, experimentally accessible operations already capture the essential performance gains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the programmability of Lindbladian semigroups, which remains largely unexplored despite the shift in viewing open systems as a computational resource rather than just a source of error.

Method: Combining physically implementable retrieval maps with time-varying program states to characterize and quantify the programmability of Lindbladian semigroups.

Result: Identification of quantum programmable classes enabled by symmetry and stochastic structure, construction of protocols for non-physically programmable cases, and introduction of an operational programming cost defined via sample requirements.

Conclusion: The framework and results provide a notion of programming cost for Lindbladians, bridge programmable channel theory with open system dynamics, and offer symmetry-driven compression schemes for semigroup simulation and control in noisy quantum technologies.

Abstract: Programmability is a unifying paradigm for enacting families of quantum transformations via fixed processors and program states, with a fundamental role and broad impact in quantum computation and control. While there has been a shift from viewing open systems solely as a source of error to treating them as a computational resource, their programmability remains largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a framework that characterizes and quantifies the programmability of Lindbladian semigroups by combining physically implementable retrieval maps with time varying program states. Within this framework, we identify quantum programmable classes enabled by symmetry and stochastic structure, including covariant semigroups and fully dissipative Pauli Lindbladians with finite program dimension. We further provide a necessary condition for physical programmability that rules out coherent generators and typical dissipators generating amplitude damping. For such nonphysically programmable cases, we construct explicit protocols with finite resources. Finally, we introduce an operational programming cost, defined via the number of samples required to program the Lindbladian, and establish its core structural properties, such as continuity and faithfulness. These results provide a notion of programming cost for Lindbladians, bridge programmable channel theory and open system dynamics, and yield symmetry driven compression schemes and actionable resource estimates for semigroup simulation and control in noisy quantum technologies.

Abstract: Major technological advances of the past century are rooted in our understanding of quantum physics in the non-interacting limit. A central challenge today is to understand the behavior of complex quantum many-body systems, where interactions play an essential role. About four decades ago, Richard Feynman proposed using controllable quantum systems to efficiently simulate complex physics and chemistry problems, envisioning quantum orreries, highly tunable quantum devices built to emulate less understood quantum systems. Here we ask whether quantum simulators have already uncovered new physical phenomena-and, if so, in which areas and with what impact. We find that, in several notable instances, they have advanced our understanding of many-body quantum dynamics. Although many of these insights could in principle have been obtained theoretically or numerically, they were nevertheless first achieved using quantum processors. While a broad landscape of problems beyond non-equilibrium dynamics still awaits exploration, it is encouraging that quantum simulators are already beginning to challenge and refine our conventional wisdom.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the acceleration and scalability of a quantum-enhanced learning scheme on actual quantum hardware, providing robust performance improvements under various challenging conditions.

Abstract: Machine learning is widely applied in modern society, but has yet to capitalise on the unique benefits offered by quantum resources. Boson sampling -- a quantum-interference based sampling protocol -- is a resource that is classically hard to simulate and can be implemented on current quantum hardware. Here, we present a quantum accelerator for classical machine learning, using boson sampling to provide a high-dimensional quantum fingerprint for reservoir computing. We show robust performance improvements under various conditions: imperfect photon sources down to complete distinguishability; scenarios with severe class imbalances, classifying both handwritten digits and biomedical images; and sparse data, maintaining model accuracy with twenty times less training data. Crucially, we demonstrate the acceleration and scalability of our scheme on a photonic quantum processing unit, providing the first experimental validation that boson-sampling-enhanced learning delivers real performance gains on actual quantum hardware.

Motivation: To achieve deterministic quantum state transfer and remote entanglement generation between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits on separate chips without relying on frequency-tunable circuit elements.

Method: Employing a frequency-tunable photon-generation technique and implementing broadband transfer resonators composed of two coupled coplanar-waveguide resonators.

Result: Achieved a bandwidth of more than 100 MHz, enabling quantum communication across a 30-MHz range of photon frequencies, with state transfer fidelities around 78% and Bell-state fidelities around 73%.

Conclusion: The approach avoids the complexity of control lines and noise channels, providing a flexible pathway toward scalable quantum networks.

Abstract: Quantum communication between remote chips is essential for realizing large-scale superconducting quantum computers. For such communication, itinerant microwave photons propagating through transmission lines offer a promising approach. However, demonstrations to date have relied on frequency-tunable circuit elements to compensate for fabrication-related parameter variations between sender and receiver devices, introducing control complexity and limiting scalability. In this work, we demonstrate deterministic quantum state transfer and remote entanglement generation between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits on separate chips. To compensate for the sender-receiver mismatch, we employ a frequency-tunable photon-generation technique which enables us to adjust the photon frequency without modifying circuit parameters. To enhance the frequency tunability, we implement broadband transfer resonators composed of two coupled coplanar-waveguide resonators, achieving a bandwidth of more than 100 MHz. This broadband design enables successful quantum communication across a 30-MHz range of photon frequencies between the remote qubits. Quantum process tomography reveals state transfer fidelities of around 78% and Bell-state fidelities of around 73% across the full frequency range. Our approach avoids the complexity of the control lines and noise channels, providing a flexible pathway toward scalable quantum networks.

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithmic routine that extends the realm of Grover-based heuristics for tackling combinatorial optimization problems with arbitrary efficiently computable objective and constraint functions. Building on previously developed quantum methods that were primarily restricted to linear constraints, we generalize the approach to encompass a broader class of problems in discrete domains. To evaluate the potential of our algorithm, we assume the existence of sufficiently advanced logical quantum hardware. With this assumption, we demonstrate that our method has the potential to outperform state-of-the-art classical solvers and heuristics in terms of both runtime scaling and solution quality. The same may be true for more realistic implementations, as the logical quantum algorithm can achieve runtime savings of up to $10^2-10^3$.

Conclusion: The SSPE scheme is demonstrated as a practical and scalable approach for fast, smooth, and low-backaction cavity reset in superconducting quantum circuits.

Abstract: In a circuit QED architecture, we experimentally demonstrate a simple and hardware-efficient Single-Step Phase-Engineered (SSPE) pulse scheme for actively depopulating the readout cavity. The method appends a reset segment with tailored amplitude and phase to a normal square readout pulse. Within the linear-response regime, the optimal reset amplitude scales proportionally with the readout amplitude, while the optimal reset phase remains nearly invariant, significantly simplifying the calibration process. By characterizing the cavity photons dynamics, we show that the SSPE pulse accelerates photon depletion by up to a factor of six compared to passive free decay. We further quantify the qubit backaction induced by the readout pulse and find that the SSPE pulse yields the lowest excitation and relaxation rates compared to a Square and CLEAR pulses. Our results establish the SSPE scheme as a practical and scalable approach for achieving fast, smooth, low-backaction cavity reset in superconducting quantum circuits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether an optimization-based approach can provide new insights and advances in quantum algorithm design, specifically for unstructured search problems.

Method: The paper reformulates unstructured search as a maximization problem on the unitary manifold and solves it using Riemannian gradient ascent (RGA) with Grover-compatible retractions to ensure physically implementable operators.

Result: The method achieves a linear convergence rate and iteration complexity of O(√N log(1/ε)), matching the quadratic speedup of Grover's algorithm, with theoretical support from a local Riemannian μ-PL inequality.

Conclusion: The optimization-based viewpoint, utilizing Riemannian gradient ascent with Grover-compatible retractions, successfully replicates the quadratic speedup of Grover's algorithm, illustrating its potential for advancing quantum algorithm design.

Abstract: Grover's algorithm is a fundamental quantum algorithm that offers a quadratic speedup for the unstructured search problem by alternately applying physically implementable oracle and diffusion operators. In this paper, we reformulate the unstructured search as a maximization problem on the unitary manifold and solve it via the Riemannian gradient ascent (RGA) method. To overcome the difficulty that generic RGA updates do not, in general, correspond to physically implementable quantum operators, we introduce Grover-compatible retractions to restrict RGA updates to valid oracle and diffusion operators. Theoretically, we establish a local Riemannian $μ$-Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) inequality with $μ= \tfrac{1}{2}$, which yields a linear convergence rate of $1 - κ^{-1}$ toward the global solution. Here, the condition number $κ= L_{\mathrm{Rie}} / μ$, where $L_{\mathrm{Rie}}$ denotes the Riemannian Lipschitz constant of the gradient. Taking into account both the geometry of the unitary manifold and the special structure of the cost function, we show that $L_{\mathrm{Rie}} = O(\sqrt{N})$ for problem size $N = 2^n$. Consequently, the resulting iteration complexity is $O(\sqrt{N} \log(1/\varepsilon))$ for attaining an $\varepsilon$-accurate solution, which matches the quadratic speedup of $O(\sqrt{N})$ achieved by Grover's algorithm. These results demonstrate that an optimization-based viewpoint can offer fresh conceptual insights and lead to new advances in the design of quantum algorithms.

Motivation: To quantify the performance cost of reducing non-Gaussian resources and benchmark sampling platforms with different input states, as the community shifts focus from initial sampling tasks to real-world applications.

Method: The paper introduces a hybrid platform (PaQS) capable of performing sampling experiments with eight Gaussian or non-Gaussian input states in a 12-mode interferometer. A semi-device-independent framework is employed to verify quantum advantage.

Result: The study shows that non-Gaussian input states provide clear performance advantages over Gaussian states, verified through a semi-device-independent framework.

Conclusion: The Paderborn Quantum Sampler (PaQS) successfully demonstrates the advantages of non-Gaussian input states in quantum sampling, showing clear performance gains and providing a direct comparison between Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes.

Abstract: The original boson sampling paradigm-consisting of multiple single-photon input states, a large interferometer, and multi-channel click detection-was originally proposed as a photonic route to quantum computational advantage. Its non-Gaussian resources, essential for outperforming any classical system, are provided by single-photon inputs and click detection. Yet the drive toward larger experiments has led to the replacement of experimentally demanding single-photon sources with Gaussian states, thereby diminishing the available non-Gaussianity-a critical quantum resource. As the community broadens its focus from the initial sampling task to possible real-world applications, it becomes crucial to quantify the performance cost associated with reducing non-Gaussian resources and to benchmark sampling platforms that employ different input states.
  To address this need, we introduce the Paderborn Quantum Sampler (PaQS), a hybrid platform capable of performing sampling experiments with eight Gaussian or non-Gaussian input states in a 12-mode interferometer within a single experimental run. This architecture enables direct, side-by-side benchmarking of distinct sampling regimes under otherwise identical conditions. By employing a semi-device-independent framework, offering certification that does not rely on prior knowledge of the interferometer or the input states, we verify that the observed data cannot be reproduced by any classical model-a prerequisite for demonstrating quantum advantage. Applying this framework, we observe clear performance gains arising from non-Gaussian input states.

Motivation: The research aims to generate and characterize ultraviolet twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) for applications in structured photocathode illumination and relativistic vortex electron generation in particle accelerator facilities.

Method: Three types of diffractive optical elements (DOEs) were used: a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. These were integrated into an electron RF-photoinjector beamline to evaluate performance under accelerator-relevant conditions.

Result: The SPP achieved a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and ~80% conversion efficiency. Binary axicons produced quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, showing low divergence and stable ring structures. The fork grating reliably generated lower-order modes (l = 2-8) with good simulation agreement.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the first comprehensive experimental generation of deep-UV high-OAM beams using fabricated DOEs, validated through mode-conversion measurements. The techniques are practical for high-power UV laser systems, enabling structured photocathode illumination and relativistic vortex electron generation in particle accelerators.

Abstract: We report on the generation and characterization of ultraviolet (wavelength 266 nm) twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) using three types of fabricated diffractive optical elements (DOEs): a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions.
  The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80\%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics.
  These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the probabilistic nature of entangled photon state generation and the limitations of post-selection techniques, heralding offers a deterministic-like solution without destroying the state.

Method: The experiment utilized a heralding technique where the detection of a single photon in one mode signaled the presence of the entangled state in three target modes, avoiding the need to measure the state directly.

Result: The generated state achieved a fidelity of 0.823 +/- 0.018 with respect to an ideal NOON state and was certified as genuinely multipartite entangled.

Conclusion: The experiment successfully generated and validated a three-mode two-photon NOON state, demonstrating high fidelity and genuine multipartite entanglement. This work provides a practical approach for entangled multi-mode state generation using current technology.

Abstract: Entangled states of photons form the foundation of quantum communication, computation, and metrology. Yet their generation remains fundamentally constrained: in the absence of intrinsic photon-photon interactions, the generation of such states is inherently probabilistic rather than deterministic. The prevalent technique of post-selection verifies the creation of an entangled state by detecting and thus destroying it. Heralding offers a solution in which measuring ancillary photons in auxiliary modes signals the state generation without the need to measure it. Here, we report an experiment to generate a three-mode two-photon NOON state, where the detection of a single photon in one heralding mode signifies the presence of the state in three target modes. We validate the generated state by estimating a fidelity of 0.823 +/- 0.018 with respect to an ideal three-mode NOON state and certifying genuine multipartite entanglement. By virtue of the high success probability and small resource overhead of our scheme, our work provides a theoretical and experimental stepping stone for entangled multi-mode state generation, which is realizable with current technology. These multi-mode entangled states represent a key direction for linear optical quantum information that is complementary to multi-qubit state encoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explain why local actions and exponential Euclidean weights appear universally across classical, statistical, and quantum theories. The authors seek a structural explanation based on minimal descriptive constraints on admissible histories.

Method: The method involves analyzing minimal constraints on finite, self-delimiting generative codes for histories. It uses descriptive cost as a smoothed minimal program length, additive over local segments, and examines the implications of these constraints on the form of actions and weights in physical theories.

Result: The results show that the universal form of an action is fixed by descriptive structure alone, while microscopic details remain system-dependent. The paper also demonstrates that finite prefix-free languages induce exponential redundancy, leading to a universal exponential weight on histories and selecting the standard Euclidean path-integral form.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the universality of local actions and exponential Euclidean weights in classical, statistical, and quantum theories can be explained by minimal descriptive constraints on finite descriptions of admissible histories. The structural requirements fix the universal form of actions and induce exponential redundancy, leading to standard Euclidean path-integral forms and, under reflection positivity, unitary Lorentzian amplitudes.

Abstract: Why do local actions and exponential Euclidean weights arise so universally in classical, statistical, and quantum theories? We offer a structural explanation from minimal constraints on finite descriptions of admissible histories. Assume that histories admit finite, self-delimiting (prefix-free) generative codes that can be decoded sequentially in a single forward pass. These purely syntactic requirements define a minimal descriptive cost, interpretable as a smoothed minimal program length, that is additive over local segments. First, any continuous local additive cost whose stationary sector coincides with the empirically identified classical variational sector is forced into a unique Euler--Lagrange equivalence class. Hence the universal form of an action is fixed by descriptional structure alone, while the specific microscopic Lagrangian and couplings remain system-dependent semantic input. Second, independently of microscopic stochasticity, finite prefix-free languages exhibit exponential redundancy: many distinct programs encode the same coarse history, and this redundancy induces a universal exponential multiplicity weight on histories. Requiring this weight to be real and bounded below selects a real Euclidean representative for stable local bosonic systems, yielding the standard Euclidean path-integral form. When Osterwalder--Schrader reflection positivity holds, the Euclidean measure reconstructs a unitary Lorentzian amplitude.

Motivation: To explore the potential of double homodyne detection beyond passive measurement, specifically for active state manipulation.

Method: Experimental realization using robust polarization-encoded double homodyne detection to characterize a squeezed vacuum state.

Result: The technique enables direct sampling of the Q function with controllable squeezing or anti-squeezing effects.

Conclusion: Unbalanced double homodyne detection is a versatile tool for simultaneous quantum state manipulation and characterization.

Abstract: The full characterization of quantum states of light is a central task in quantum optics and information science. Double homodyne detection provides a powerful method for the direct measurement of the Husimi Q quasi-probability distribution, offering a complete state representation in a simple experimental setting and a limited time frame. Here, we demonstrate that double homodyne detection can serve as more than a passive measurement apparatus. By intentionally unbalancing the input beamsplitter that splits the quantum signal, we show that the detection scheme itself performs an effective squeezing or anti-squeezing transformation on the state being measured. The resulting measurement directly samples the Q function of the input state as if it were acted upon by a squeezing operator whose strength is a tunable experimental parameter : the beamsplitter's reflectivity. We experimentally realize this technique using a robust polarization-encoded double homodyne detection to characterize a squeezed vacuum state. Our results demonstrate the controlled deformation of the measured Q function's phase-space distribution, confirming that unbalanced double homodyne detection is a versatile tool for simultaneous quantum state manipulation and characterization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of magnomechanical systems in quantum signal processing and sensing by investigating magnomechanically induced transparency and its tunability in parity-time-symmetric regimes.

Method: The setup involves a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a yttrium iron garnet sphere, hybridized with a mechanical mode via magnetostrictive interaction. Non-Hermitian coupling introduces gain-assisted transparency.

Result: The transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response, and non-Hermitian coupling leads to asymmetric transmission and Fano-type line shapes.

Conclusion: The study establishes parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a versatile platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing, showcasing tunable slow- and fast-light behavior.

Abstract: We investigate magnomechanically induced transparency in a parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanical system with traveling-field-induced non-Hermiticity. The setup consists of a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere, which in turn are hybridized with a vibrational mechanical mode through magnetostrictive interaction. In the Hermitian regime, strong photon-magnon coupling generates a single transparency window in the cavity transmission, which splits into a doublet when the magnon is coherently hybridized with the mechanical mode via magnomechanical coupling. This establishes a versatile platform in which the transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response using experimentally accessible, scaled magnomechanical interactions. When a non-Hermitian coupling is introduced, the system enters a parity-time-broken regime in which the transparency ceases to be purely passive and becomes gain assisted, leading to asymmetric transmission with amplification on one side of the resonance and enhanced absorption on the other. By tuning the cavity detuning, we convert magnomechanical transparency into Fano-type line shapes with strongly non-Lorentzian phase dispersion and map their deformation into asymmetric, gain-assisted Fano ridges in the joint space of probe and magnon detunings. Finally, we analyze the associated group delay and show that both slow- and fast-light behavior can be widely tuned by varying the photon-magnon and magnomechanical couplings together with the non-Hermitian strength, highlighting parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a promising platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand and characterize processes with indefinite causal order, which arise in quantum theory and beyond, by identifying a universal information-theoretic principle.

Method: The paper identifies and analyzes the principle of parity erasure through an information-theoretic approach, using axioms for general operational probabilistic theories rather than relying on quantum formalism.

Result: The paper establishes that parity erasure completely characterizes processes with indefinite causal order, providing a framework that extends beyond quantum theory.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that parity erasure is a fundamental principle that characterizes processes with indefinite causal order, applicable beyond quantum theory due to its derivation from general operational probabilistic theories.

Abstract: Processes with indefinite causal order can arise when quantum theory is locally valid. Here, we identify an information-theoretic principle, termed parity erasure, that completely characterizes such processes. Our characterization does not rely on the formalism of quantum theory itself, but instead is derived from a set of axioms for general operational probabilistic theories, and thus holds also for a large class of theories beyond quantum theory. This informational approach reveals a fundamental property of information exchange in scenarios with indefinite causal structure.

Method: Mapping quantum dynamics of a Brownian particle in the Caldeira-Leggett model to a classical non-Markovian stochastic process in phase space, using Wigner functions as statistical weights for trajectory ensembles.

Result: The mapping is exact for quadratic potentials and offers a controlled approximation for smooth potentials, with applications to arbitrary initial quantum states and external manipulations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a general method for mapping quantum dynamics to classical stochastic processes, applicable to a wide range of quantum states and potential scenarios, including driven-dissipative protocols.

Abstract: We establish that the exact quantum dynamics of a Brownian particle in the Caldeira-Leggett model can be mapped, at any temperature, onto a classical, non-Markovian stochastic process in phase space. Starting from a correlated thermal equilibrium state between the particle and bath, we prove that this correspondence is exact for quadratic potentials under arbitrary quantum state preparations of the particle itself. For more general, smooth potentials, we identify and exploit a natural small parameter: the density matrix becomes strongly quasidiagonal in the coordinate representation, with its off-diagonal width shrinking as the bath's spectral cutoff increases, providing a controlled parameter for accurate approximation. The framework is fully general: arbitrary initial quantum states-including highly non-classical superpositions-are incorporated via their Wigner functions, which serve as statistical weights for trajectory ensembles. Furthermore, the formalism naturally accommodates external manipulations and measurements modeled by preparation functions acting at arbitrary times, enabling the simulation of complex driven-dissipative quantum protocols.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal was to achieve spectrally uniform squeezing in quantum microcombs for continuous-variable quantum information processing, despite the limitations posed by asymmetry and anomalies in dispersion profiles.

Method: The researchers combined a microresonator with an engineered mode spectrum and optimized pump conditions to overcome dispersion-related challenges.

Result: A CV quantum microcomb with 14 independent two-mode squeezed states was realized, each showing over 4 dB of raw squeezing (up to 4.3 dB) across a 0.7 THz bandwidth.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a uniform quantum microcomb with high-performance squeezing, marking a significant advancement toward scalable and integrated continuous-variable quantum technologies.

Abstract: Quantum microcombs generated in high-Q microresonators provide compact, multiplexed sources of entangled modes for continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing. While deterministic generation of CV states via Kerr-induced two-mode squeezing has been demonstrated, achieving spectrally uniform squeezing remains challenging because of asymmetry and anomalies in the dispersion profile. Here we overcome these limitations by combining a microresonator with an engineered mode spectrum and optimized pump conditions. We realize a CV quantum microcomb comprising 14 independent two-mode squeezed states, each exhibiting more than 4 dB of raw squeezing (up to 4.3 dB) across a 0.7 THz bandwidth. This uniform, high-performance quantum resource represents a key step toward scalable, integrated CV quantum technologies operating beyond classical limits.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A spectroscopic framework for detecting photonic topology in a cavity-QED system, revealing topological phases via spectral data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a direct and measurable proxy for topological characteristics from spectral data without requiring bulk-band tomography.

Method: Utilizes spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity with a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate.

Result: Demonstrates that the cavity transmission power spectral density reveals topological phases, including Dirac-like trivial phases and gap-spanning spectral ridges with non-Hermitian topology.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems, enabling control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.

Abstract: Topological photonic phases are typically identified through band reconstruction, steady-state transmission, or real-space imaging of edge modes. In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.

### [83] [A Unified Framework for Optimizing Uniformly Controlled Structures in Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08675)
*Chengzhuo Xu,Xiao Chen,Xi Li,Zhihao Liu,Zhigang Li*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified algebraic model (rUCG) for quantum unitaries with uniformly controlled structures, optimizing gate complexity and depth, validated by empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum unitaries with uniformly controlled structures are common in quantum algorithms, but their complexities have not been systematically analyzed. The lack of a unified framework motivates this work to study and optimize such structures.

Method: The study introduces the restricted Uniformly Controlled Gates (rUCGs) as a unified algebraic model, defined by a 2-divisible Abelian group. It develops a general framework to decompose n-control rUCGs, reducing gate complexity from O(n2^n) to O(2^n) and circuit depth from O(2^n log n) to O(2^n log n/n).

Result: The proposed rUCG model captures uniformly controlled rotations, multi-qubit gates, and diagonal unitaries, with a k-sparse variant (k-rUCGs). The framework reduces gate complexity and circuit depth, empirically validated on QAOA circuits and quantum state preparation.

Conclusion: The rUCG model and its decomposition framework provide a unified approach to analyzing and optimizing circuits with uniformly controlled structures, achieving significant reductions in gate complexity and circuit depth, as demonstrated through empirical evaluations.

Abstract: Quantum unitaries of the form ${Σ_{c}\ket{c}\bra{c}\otimes U_{c}}$ are ubiquitous in quantum algorithms. This class encompasses not only standard uniformly controlled gates (UCGs) but also a wide range of circuits with uniformly controlled structures. However, their circuit-depth and gate-count complexities have not been systematically analyzed within a unified framework. In this work, we study the general decomposition problem for UCG and UCG-like structure. We then introduce the restricted Uniformly Controlled Gates (rUCGs) as a unified algebraic model, defined by a 2-divisible Abelian group that models the controlled gate set. This model captures uniformly controlled rotations, multi-qubit uniformly controlled gates, and diagonal unitaries. Furthermore, this model also naturally incorporates k-sparse version (k-rUCGs), where only a subset of control qubits participate in each multi-qubit gate. Building on this algebraic model, we develop a general framework. For an n-control rUCG, the framework reduce the gate complexity from ${O(n2^n)}$ to ${O(2^n})$ and the circuit depth from ${O(2^n\log n)}$ to ${O(2^n\log n/n)}$. The framework further provides systematic size and depth bounds for k-rUCGs by exploiting sparsity in the control space, with same optimization coefficient as rUCG, respectively. Empirical evaluations on representative QAOA circuits and quantum state preparation both confirm reductions in depth and size. Crucially, these results highlight that the rUCG model and its associated decomposition framework unify circuits previously considered structurally distinct under a single, asymptotically optimal synthesis paradigm.

*Tian-Yi Gu,Gaoyong Sun*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Generalizing Lee-Yang theory to quantum phase transitions, the study shows fidelity zeros and symmetry breaking in quantum models under complex fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Lee-Yang theory for understanding quantum phase transitions and dynamical quantum phase transitions through non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and fidelity zeros.

Method: Analysis of quantum models (XY, XXZ, XYZ, and Z3 clock model) under complex external magnetic fields to study non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and fidelity zeros.

Result: Complex fields induce parity symmetry breaking and fidelity zeros in ordered phases for XY, XXZ, and XYZ models. For the Z3 clock model, fidelity zeros arise after projecting out a charged sector, with critical exponents matching predictions.

Conclusion: The study generalizes Lee-Yang theory to quantum phase transitions, revealing fidelity zeros and non-Hermitian symmetry breaking in various quantum models. The findings are consistent with analytical predictions.

Abstract: Lee-Yang theory offers a unifying framework for understanding classical phase transitions and dynamical quantum phase transitions through the analysis of partition functions and Loschmidt echoes. Recently, this framework is extended to characterize quantum phase transitions in arXiv:2509.20258 by introducing the concepts of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and fidelity zeros. Here, we generalize the theory by studying a broad class of quantum models, including the XY model, the XXZ model, the XYZ model, and the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model in one dimension, subject to complex external magnetic field. For the XY, XXZ and XYZ models, we find that the complex field breaks parity symmetry and induces oscillations of the ground state between the two parity sectors, giving rise to fidelity zeros within the ordered phases. For the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model, the complex field splits the real part of the ground-state energy between the neutral sector ($q=0$) and the charged sectors ($q=1,2$), while preserving the degeneracy within the charged sector. Fidelity zeros arise only after projecting out one of the charged sectors, and the finite-size scaling of these zeros produces critical exponents fully consistent with analytical predictions.

*Jalan A. Ziyad,Robin Blume-Kohout,Kenneth Rudinger*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Non-Markovian dynamics in logical qubits arise from Markovian physical noise due to syndrome qubits acting as memory, with conditions proposed for reliable gate-based characterization in fault-tolerant devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the emergent non-Markovianity in logical qubits encoded in quantum error correcting codes, despite underlying Markovian physical noise.

Method: Defining a Markovianity condition for logical gate operations and relating them to physical implementations, applied to small quantum codes with simple noise models.

Result: Non-Markovianity emerges if physical qubits are not returned to the code subspace after QEC rounds, quantified in simple examples and conditions for reliable gate-based techniques proposed.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that non-Markovian dynamics can emerge in logical qubits even under Markovian physical noise, due to the syndrome qubits acting as a memory. It provides sufficient conditions for reliable gate-based characterization techniques in early fault-tolerant quantum devices.

Abstract: Logical qubits encoded in quantum error correcting codes can exhibit non-Markovian dynamical evolution, even when the underlying physical noise is Markovian. To understand this emergent non-Markovianity, we define a Markovianity condition appropriate to logical gate operations, and study it by relating logical operations to their physical implementation (operations on the data qubits into which the logical qubit is encoded). We apply our analysis to small quantum codes, and show that they exhibit non-Markovian dynamics even for very simple physical noise models. We show that non-Markovianity can emerge from Markovian physical operations if (and only if) the physical qubits are not necessarily returned to the code subspace after every round of QEC. In this situation, the syndrome qubits can act as a memory, mediating time correlations and enabling violation of the Markov condition. We quantify the emergent non-Markovianity in simple examples, and propose sufficient conditions for reliable use of gate-based characterization techniques like gate set tomography in early fault-tolerant quantum devices.

*Pablo Tikas Pueyo,Tomás Fernández Martos,Gabriel Senno*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Extension of deterministic extractors to semi-device-independent prepare-and-measure scenarios, showing practical viability in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting randomness from quantum entropy sources in a semi-device-independent setting, building on prior work that utilized structured knowledge about the source.

Method: Extending previous constructions for deterministic extractors to memoryless devices under an overlap assumption on quantum states, with numerical simulations on a new family of behaviors.

Result: Proved that the functions are extractors in the new setting and observed positive key rates in simulations with 7,000 rounds.

Conclusion: The study extends deterministic extractors to a semi-device-independent prepare-and-measure scenario, demonstrating practical applicability with positive key rates in experimental simulations.

Abstract: It is a well-known fact in classical information theory that no deterministic procedure can extract close-to-ideal randomness from an arbitrary entropy source. On the other hand, if additional knowledge about the source is available -- e.g., that it is a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials -- then deterministic extractors do exist. For quantum entropy sources, where in addition to classical random variables we consider quantum side information, the use of extra knowledge about their structure was pioneered in a recent publication [C. Foreman and L. Masanes, Quantum 9, 1654 (2025)]. In that work, the authors provide deterministic extractors for device-independent randomness generation with memoryless devices achieving a sufficiently high CHSH score. In this work, we extend their construction to the prepare-and-measure scenario. Specifically, we prove that the considered functions are also extractors for memoryless devices in a semi-device-independent setting under an overlap assumption on the prepared quantum states. We then simulate the resulting randomness generation protocol on a novel and experimentally relevant family of behaviors, observing positive key rates already for $7\times 10^3$ rounds.

TL;DR: SAQ-Decoder unifies transformer-based learning with post-processing to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in Quantum Error Correction decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff in Quantum Error Correction decoding, where classical methods lack efficiency and neural decoders lack accuracy.

Method: The approach uses a dual-stream transformer architecture with asymmetric attention patterns and a differentiable logical loss to optimize Logical Error Rates through smooth approximations over finite fields.

Result: SAQ-Decoder achieves near-optimal performance with error thresholds of 10.99% (independent noise) and 18.6% (depolarizing noise), outperforming existing neural and classical baselines.

Conclusion: SAQ-Decoder combines transformer-based learning with constraint-aware post-processing to achieve near Maximum Likelihood accuracy and linear computational scalability, demonstrating that learned decoders can meet key requirements for practical fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.

Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding faces a fundamental accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. Classical methods like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) exhibit variable performance across noise models and suffer from polynomial complexity, while tensor network decoders achieve high accuracy but at prohibitively high computational cost. Recent neural decoders reduce complexity but lack the accuracy needed to compete with computationally expensive classical methods. We introduce SAQ-Decoder, a unified framework combining transformer-based learning with constraint aware post-processing that achieves both near Maximum Likelihood (ML) accuracy and linear computational scalability with respect to the syndrome size. Our approach combines a dual-stream transformer architecture that processes syndromes and logical information with asymmetric attention patterns, and a novel differentiable logical loss that directly optimizes Logical Error Rates (LER) through smooth approximations over finite fields. SAQ-Decoder achieves near-optimal performance, with error thresholds of 10.99% (independent noise) and 18.6% (depolarizing noise) on toric codes that approach the ML bounds of 11.0% and 18.9% while outperforming existing neural and classical baselines in accuracy, complexity, and parameter efficiency. Our findings establish that learned decoders can simultaneously achieve competitive decoding accuracy and computational efficiency, addressing key requirements for practical fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.
