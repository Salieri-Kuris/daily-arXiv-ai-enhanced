Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Researchers used BiFeO3 thin films to achieve tunable, narrowband THz emission via coupled phonon-polaritons and magneto-acoustic dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of efficient generation and tunability in the THz regime, leveraging the unique properties of multiferroic BiFeO3.

Method: The researchers utilized bare epitaxial thin films and Pt/BiFeO3 bilayers, employing sub-bandgap optical rectification and coupling electromagnon branches with ultrafast strain waves to study THz emission.

Result: Efficient narrowband THz emission was achieved in the range of 0.4-0.8 THz, demonstrating tunability through Pt layer thickness variation.

Conclusion: The study highlights BiFeO3 as a versatile platform for narrowband THz emission, uncovering the interplay between phonons, magnons, and magneto-acoustic dynamics in antiferromagnetic multiferroics.

Abstract: Collective excitations such as magnons and polar phonons provide natural access to the terahertz (THz) regime, but efficient generation and tunability remain elusive. Multiferroic BiFeO3 combines both orders at room temperature, offering a unique platform for narrowband THz emission. Here, we achieve efficient sub-bandgap optical rectification of coupled phonon-polaritons near 2 THz in bare epitaxial thin films. In Pt/BiFeO3 bilayers, we demonstrate that coupling the electromagnon branch with ultrafast strain waves, optically generated in Pt layers with various thicknesses, can produce tunable and narrowband emission between 0.4-0.8 THz. These results uncover the intertwined role of phonons, magnons, and magneto-acoustic dynamics in antiferromagnetic multiferroics, and establish these hybrid platforms as versatile engineered narrowband THz sources.

TL;DR: A framework links orbital and heat magnetizations to excitation spectra via thermoelectric probes, proposing experimental implementations in quantum-engineered platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To relate orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules.

Method: By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions.

Result: A hierarchical construction organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and real-space markers of these magnetizations are derived.

Conclusion: Our results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under thermoelectric chiral drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.

TL;DR: 研究通过密度泛函理论揭示了扭转双层铋薄片边缘的结构无序如何显著增强电子态密度，为提升超导转变温度提供了新机制。

Motivation: 为了解决扭转双层结构在器件应用中面临的基本问题——边界异质性，揭示扭转角在设计和优化新型工程器件中的关键作用。

Method: 采用从头算密度泛函理论（ab initio density functional theory）系统地研究了扭转双层铋薄片的电子性质和振动性质。

Abstract: Twisted bilayers offer a compelling and, at times, confounding platform for the engineering of new twistronic materials. Whereas standard studies almost exclusively focus on the explicit enigma that is presented by twist-angles, perhaps better epitomized by the related phenomena that have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene, functional devices necessarily face a fundamental concern: boundary heterogeneity in their structures. In this study, we address this concern by strictly investigating the electronic properties of twisted bismuth bilayers at the flake's edges and the vibrational properties of the flake. Twisted flakes exhibit continuous variations of these properties, away from the bulk, as we herein report using ab initio density functional theory, by systematically mapping the drastic evolution of band topology, electronic density of states, and possible superconductivity. Our work reveals a dramatic, non-fortuitous consequence of the structural disorder at the edges of the flakes: an enhanced electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This enhancement reaches a maximum of 10 times that of perfect-crystalline bismuth. Given that the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, is exponentially dependent on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, this substantial structural variation immediately suggests a powerful mechanism for vastly increasing Tc. We also identify the twist-angle as a new critical parameter in designing novel engineering devices with topologically enhanced properties. Our results provide a necessary theoretical framework for interpreting new data for the upcoming generation of twistronic heterogeneous materials, and pave the way to search for atomic disordered metastable structures that could lead to enhanced superconducting transition temperatures.

### [4] [Holographically Emergent Gauge Theory in Symmetric Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21685)
*Akash Vijay,Jong Yeon Lee*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A holographic framework for mixed-state phases in quantum circuits reveals topological protection under noise, with transitions between charge-fuzzy and charge-sharp phases driven by measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the emergent phases and transitions in mixed-state quantum systems with global symmetry $G$, especially under the influence of random circuits and noise.

Method: The framework decomposes the quantum circuit into symmetric (gauge wavefunction) and non-symmetric (random multiplicity tensors) layers, analyzing transitions under unitarity and non-unitarity conditions.

Result: For $G=\mathbb{Z}_N$, the circuit exhibits a charge sharpening transition under weak measurements, with distinct phases (charge-fuzzy, charge-sharp, and Coulomb) depending on $N$. The bulk gauge theory's decoherence-induced transition is linked to the circuit's error-correcting capability.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that non-unitary circuits with global symmetry $G$ can act as quantum error-correcting codes, with a topological protection mechanism. The decoherence-induced phase transition and charge sharpening transition are complementary, revealing insights into the interplay between noise and measurement in quantum systems.

Abstract: We develop a novel holographic framework for mixed-state phases in random quantum circuits, both unitary and non-unitary, with a global symmetry $G$. Viewing the circuit as a tensor network, we decompose it into two parts: a symmetric layer, which defines an emergent gauge wavefunction in one higher dimension, and a random non-symmetric layer, which consists of random multiplicity tensors. For unitarity circuits, the bulk gauge state is deconfined, but under a generic non-unitary circuit (e.g. channels), the bulk gauge theory can undergo a decoherence-induced phase transition: for $G\,{=}\,\mathbb{Z}_N$ with local symmetric noise, the circuit can act as a quantum error-correcting code with a distinguished logical subspace inheriting the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-surface code's topological protection. We then identify that the charge sharpening transition from the measurement side is complementary to a decodability transition in the bulk: noise of the bulk can be interpreted as measurement from the environment. For $N\,{\leq}\,4$, weak measurements drive a single transition from a charge-fuzzy phase with sharpening time $t_{\#}\sim e^{L}$ to a charge-sharp phase with $t_{\#}\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$, corresponding to confinement that destroys logical information. For $N>4$, measurements generically generate an intermediate quasi-long-range ordered Coulomb phase with gapless photons and purification time $t_{\#}\sim \mathcal{O}(L)$.

### [5] [The derivation of the Liouville equation from the Schrodinger equation and its implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21601)
*A. P. Meilakhs*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A rigorous method to derive the Boltzmann equation from the Schrödinger equation, avoiding non-rigorous assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a new and rigorous way of deriving classical mechanics from quantum mechanics, particularly the Boltzmann equation, by leveraging quantum mechanical principles.

Method: The method involves using the Liouville equation to deduce the non-collision part of the Boltzmann equation and the matrix of transition rates to derive the collision integral.

Result: The key result is the derivation of the Boltzmann equation directly from the Schrödinger equation, showcasing a unified and mathematically sound approach.

Conclusion: The manuscript successfully derives the Boltzmann equation from the Schrödinger equation through rigorous mathematical manipulation, eliminating the need for non-rigorous plausible reasoning.

Abstract: We present a new way of deriving classical mechanics from quantum mechanics. A key feature of the method is its compatibility with the standard approach used to derive transition rates between quantum states due to interactions. We apply the developed method to derive the main formulas of physical kinetics. We observe that, through the Liouville equation, we can deduce the non-collision part of the Boltzmann equation, and that, through the matrix of transition rates, we can deduce the collision integral. As a final result of the manuscript, we derive the Boltzmann equation from the Schrödinger equation as a single piece of formal mathematical manipulation, without any non-rigorous plausible reasoning used to glue together its different parts.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum walks modeled with neutral atom hardware show promise for fluid dynamics, using error analysis for multiqubit gates to simulate 'lazy' quantum walks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum walks can model fluid dynamics, and neutral atom hardware offers advantages for implementing these walks due to its capability for native multiqubit gates and dynamic qubit re-arrangement.

Method: Error modeling for multiqubit Rydberg gates via two-photon adiabatic rapid passage was used to analyze gate sequences and predict final state fidelities for toy quantum walks.

Result: The study presents gate sequences and predicted fidelities for toy quantum walks, including 'lazy' quantum walks, which include a rest state and are a step towards fluid simulation.

Conclusion: The abstract highlights the potential of neutral atom hardware for implementing quantum walks, particularly for fluid dynamics simulation, and presents error modeling for multiqubit gates.

Abstract: Quantum walks, the quantum analogue to the classical random walk, have been shown to model fluid dynamics. Neutral atom hardware is a promising choice of platform for implementing quantum walks due to its ability to implement native multiqubit ($\geq\!3$-qubit) gates and to dynamically re-arrange qubits. Using error modelling for multiqubit Rydberg gates via two-photon adiabatic rapid passage, we present the gate sequences and predicted final state fidelities for some toy quantum walks, including `lazy' quantum walks. These `lazy' quantum walks include a rest state and therefore provide an integral step towards quantum walks for fluid simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a versatile, tunable, and scalable single-photon source for quantum technologies.

Method: Single-photon emission was verified using second-order correlation measurements, and spectrally selective cavity-enhanced emission features were analyzed, including acoustic phonon sideband effects.

Result: A $g^{(2)}(τ=0)$ value of 0.3 was achieved, confirming single-photon emission. The system showed non-resonant emitter-cavity coupling influenced by acoustic phonon sidebands.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the successful integration of a WS$_2$-based single-photon source into an open tunable microcavity, showcasing its potential for scalable quantum technologies.

Abstract: Versatile, tunable, and potentially scalable single-photon sources are a key asset in emergent photonic quantum technologies. In this work, a single-photon source based on WS$_2$ micro-domes, created via hydrogen ion irradiation, is realized and integrated into an open, tunable optical microcavity. Single-photon emission from the coupled emitter-cavity system is verified via the second-order correlation measurement, revealing a $g^{(2)}(τ=0)$ value of 0.3. A detailed analysis of the spectrally selective, cavity enhanced emission features shows the impact of a pronounced acoustic phonon emission sideband, which contributes specifically to the non-resonant emitter-cavity coupling in this system. The achieved level of cavity-emitter control highlights the potential of open-cavity systems to tailor the emission properties of atomically thin quantum emitters, advancing their suitability for real-world quantum technology applications.

### [8] [Factorisation conditions and causality for local measurements in QFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21644)
*Robin Simmons,Maria Papageorgiou,Marios Christodoulou,Časlav Brukner*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a criterion for physically admissible measurements in QFT using the local S-matrix formalism, excluding superluminal signalling and retrocausality. It also shows the retarded propagator limits measurement accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of general operational criteria for physically implementable measurements in quantum field theory, particularly in scenarios involving superluminal signalling or retrocausality.

Method: The study adopts the local S-matrix formalism and utilizes a hierarchy of factorisation conditions to exclude signalling and retrocausality. It further derives local causality conditions for Kraus operators induced by interactions between smeared field operators and a pointer degree of freedom.

Result: The results demonstrate that the local S-matrix formalism can provide a criterion to exclude impossible measurements. The study also identifies the retarded propagator of the field as a fundamental limit for measuring local field observables.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the local S-matrix formalism and a hierarchy of factorisation conditions can effectively exclude superluminal signalling and retrocausality, providing a general criterion for physically implementable measurements in QFT. Additionally, the accuracy of local field measurements is fundamentally limited by the retarded propagator of the field.

Abstract: Quantum operations that are perfectly admissible in non-relativistic quantum theory can enable signalling between spacelike separated regions when naively imported into quantum field theory (QFT). Prominent examples of such "impossible measurements", in the sense of Sorkin, include certain unitary kicks and projective measurements. It is generally accepted that only those quantum operations whose physical implementation arises from a fully relativistically covariant interaction, between the quantum field and a suitable probe, should be regarded as admissible. While this idea has been realised at the level of abstract algebraic QFT, or via particular measurement models, there is still no general set of operational criteria characterising which measurements are physically implementable. In this work we adopt the local S-matrix formalism, and make use of a hierarchy of factorisation conditions that exclude both superluminal signalling and retrocausality, thereby providing such a criterion. Realising the local S-matrices through explicit interactions between smeared field operators and a pointer degree of freedom, we further derive local causality conditions for the induced Kraus operators, which guarantee the absence of signalling in "impossible measurement" scenarios. Finally, we show that the accuracy with which local field observables can be measured is fundamentally limited by the retarded propagator of the field, which also plays an essential role in a factorisation identity we prove for the field Kraus operators.

### [9] [Rapid ground state energy estimation with a Sparse Pauli Dynamics-enabled Variational Double Bracket Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21651)
*Chinmay Shrikhande,Arnab Bachhar,Aaron Rodriguez Jimenez,Nicholas J. Mayhall*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new algorithm (vDBF) for ground state energy estimation in quantum systems offers significant speed and accuracy improvements over traditional methods like DMRG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of ground state energy estimation for strongly correlated quantum systems, especially in higher dimensions, where traditional methods like DMRG are computationally expensive.

Method: The vDBF algorithm combines greedy operator selection, coefficient truncation, and energy-variance extrapolation, leveraging Sparse Pauli Dynamics for efficient computation.

Result: vDBF achieves less than 1% error relative to DMRG benchmarks for Heisenberg and Hubbard models, with significant computational speedup (e.g., 10 minutes vs. 50 hours for a 10x10 Heisenberg lattice).

Conclusion: The vDBF algorithm demonstrates significant speedup and accuracy for ground state energy estimation in strongly correlated quantum systems, suggesting classical simulation techniques can be practical for many-body physics.

Abstract: Ground state energy estimation for strongly correlated quantum systems remains a central challenge in computational physics and chemistry. While tensor network methods like DMRG provide efficient solutions for one-dimensional systems, higher-dimensional problems remain difficult. Here we present a variational double bracket flow (vDBF) algorithm that leverages Sparse Pauli Dynamics, a technique originally developed for classical simulation of quantum circuits, to efficiently approximate ground state energies. By combining greedy operator selection with coefficient truncation and energy-variance extrapolation, the method achieves less than 1% error relative to DMRG benchmarks for both Heisenberg and Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. For a 10x10 Heisenberg lattice (100 qubits), vDBF obtains accurate results in approximately 10 minutes on a single CPU thread, compared to over 50 hours on 64 threads for DMRG. For an 8x8 Hubbard model (128 qubits), the speedup is even more pronounced. These results demonstrate that classical simulation techniques developed in the context of quantum advantage benchmarking can provide practical tools for many-body physics.

### [10] [FPGA-tailored algorithms for real-time decoding of quantum LDPC codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21660)
*Satvik Maurya,Thilo Maurer,Markus Bühler,Drew Vandeth,Michael E. Beverland*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: FPGA-tailored decoders for qLDPC codes are analyzed, with message passing (Relay) proving superior to filtered-OSD and clustering methods for real-time decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time decoding is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing, and FPGA hardware's parallelism can affect algorithmic performance. The study aims to evaluate the practicality of different decoder classes for qLDPC codes on FPGAs.

Method: The study analyzes FPGA-tailored versions of three decoder classes for qLDPC codes: message passing (Relay decoder), a filtered variant of ordered statistics decoding (OSD), and an FPGA-adapted generalized union-find decoder for clustering. A systolic algorithm for Gaussian elimination on rank-deficient systems is also designed for fast validity checks and local corrections.

Result: The Relay decoder outperforms the FPGA-tailored OSD and clustering methods in both speed and accuracy, despite algorithmic improvements to the latter two.

Conclusion: Message passing, specifically the Relay decoder, is the most viable method for real-time quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) decoding due to its superior speed and accuracy compared to FPGA-tailored variants of ordered statistics decoding (OSD) and clustering methods.

Abstract: Real-time decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computing but likely requires specialized hardware such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), whose parallelism can alter relative algorithmic performance. We analyze FPGA-tailored versions of three decoder classes for quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes: message passing, ordered statistics, and clustering. For message passing, we analyze the recently introduced Relay decoder and its FPGA implementation; for ordered statistics decoding (OSD), we introduce a filtered variant that concentrates computation on high-likelihood fault locations; and for clustering, we design an FPGA-adapted generalized union-find decoder. We design a systolic algorithm for Gaussian elimination on rank-deficient systems that runs in linear parallel time, enabling fast validity checks and local corrections in clustering and eliminating costly full-rank inversion in filtered-OSD. Despite these improvements, both remain far slower and less accurate than Relay, suggesting message passing is the most viable route to real-time qLDPC decoding.

*Jonas Treplin,Philipp Kleinpaß,Davide Orsucci*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Advantage Distillation (AD) post-processing enhances decoy-state BB84 QKD by increasing the maximum tolerable QBER from 9.5% to 17.3%, improving secure link distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve the practicality and security of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols by increasing the maximum acceptable QBER through post-processing techniques, thereby extending the operational distance of QKD links.

Method: The study employs a finite key-size analysis to evaluate the performance of decoy-state BB84 QKD protocols enhanced with AD post-processing, which involves post-selecting blocks of bits to extract fewer high-fidelity bits with reduced QBER.

Result: The use of AD post-processing raises the maximum acceptable QBER from approximately 9.5% to 17.3% for realistic key sizes, significantly enhancing the performance of decoy-state BB84 QKD protocols.

Conclusion: Advantage Distillation (AD) significantly enhances the practical performance of decoy-state BB84 QKD protocols by increasing the maximum tolerable Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) from 9.5% to 17.3% for realistic key sizes, demonstrating the potential for substantial improvements in secure QKD link distance through post-processing method enhancements.

Abstract: Advantage Distillation (AD) is a classical post-processing technique that enhances Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols by increasing the maximum acceptable Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) and thus extending the distance at which QKD links can be securely established. AD operates by post-selecting blocks of bits and extracting fewer high-fidelity bits, exhibiting a reduced QBER and thus lowering the amount of information that has to be disclosed during the information reconciliation step. In this work we present the first comprehensive finite key-size analysis of decoy-state BB84 enhanced via AD post-processing. We demonstrate that through the use of AD the maximum acceptable QBER increases from around $9.5\%$ to around $17.3\%$ for realistic key sizes. This result shows that substantial performance enhancements can be achieved in scenarios which are constrained by the maximum tolerable QBER via improvements of the post-processing method alone.

*Lasse Gresista,Dominik Kiese,Simon Trebst,Yasir Iqbal*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Study of spin-1/2 Heisenberg model reveals unconventional nonmagnetic phases, including potential quantum spin liquids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate unconventional orders in frustrated quantum magnets via the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice.

Method: Cluster mean-field, pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group, and Luttinger-Tisza treatment.

Result: Discovery of distinct correlation profiles, hexagonal singlet states, and evidence of spin-nematic order in the paramagnetic region.

Conclusion: The study identifies an extended region without conventional dipolar magnetic order, featuring various nonmagnetic phases, including potential quantum spin liquids, revealed through complementary methods.

Abstract: Motivated by the search for unconventional orders in frustrated quantum magnets, we present a multi-method investigation into the nature of the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice with three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor interactions. It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids. Our phase diagram is built from a complementary application of state-of-the-art implementations of the cluster mean-field and pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group approaches, together with an unconstrained Luttinger-Tisza treatment of the model providing insights from the semi-classical limit.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A review of Hartree-Fock mean-field theory applied to moiré materials, particularly MA-TBG, covering ground states, collective modes, and heterostrain effects, with case studies and open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a comprehensive review of theoretical modeling of moiré materials, specifically MA-TBG, using Hartree-Fock mean-field theory, to aid researchers in understanding and building detailed models for such systems.

Method: The paper employs Hartree-Fock mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and interactions in moiré materials, with specific focus on MA-TBG. It includes case studies on the chiral-flat limit, intermediate-coupling IKS order, and domain walls in orbital Chern insulating states.

Result: The results include detailed insights into the ground state structure, collective excitations, and the effects of heterostrain in MA-TBG, as well as the adaptation of mean-field theory to non-invariant settings for studying domain walls.

Conclusion: The review concludes by emphasizing the versatility of the Hartree-Fock mean-field theory in modeling moiré materials, particularly MA-TBG, and its potential for further extensions and applications.

Abstract: We review the theoretical modelling of moiré materials, focusing on various aspects of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MA-TBG) viewed through the lens of Hartree-Fock mean-field theory. We first provide an elementary introduction to the continuum modelling of moiré bandstructures, and explain how interactions are incorporated to study correlated states. We then discuss how to implement mean-field simulations of ground state structure and collective excitations in this setting. With this background established, we rationalize the power of mean-field approximations in MA-TBG, by discussing the idealized "chiral-flat" strong-coupling limit, in which ground states at electron densities commensurate with the moiré superlattice are exactly captured by mean-field ansätze. We then illustrate the phenomenological shortcomings of this limit, leading us naturally into a discussion of the intermediate-coupling incommensurate Kekulé spiral (IKS) order and its origins in ever-present heterostrain. IKS and its placement within an expanded Hartree-Fock manifold form our first "case study". Our second case study involves time-dependence, and focuses on the collective modes of various broken-symmetry insulators in MA-TBG. As a third and final case study, we return to the strong-coupling picture, which can be stabilized by aligning MA-TBG to an hBN substrate. In this limit, we show how mean field theory can be adapted to the translationally non-invariant setting in order to quantitatively study the energetics of domain walls in orbital Chern insulating states. We close with a discussion of extensions and further applications. Used either as a standalone reference or alongside the accompanying open-source code, this review should enable readers with a basic knowledge of band theory and many-body physics to systematically build and analyze detailed models of generic moiré systems.
