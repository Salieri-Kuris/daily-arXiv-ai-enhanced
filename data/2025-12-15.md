Abstract: We develop a systematic theoretical approach to incorporate the effects of a static white-noise disorder into the BCS-BEC crossover near the critical temperature ($T_c$) of the superfluid transition. Starting from a functional-integral formulation in momentum-frequency space, we derive an effective thermodynamic potential that fully accounts for Gaussian fluctuations of the order-parameter field and its coupling to the disorder potential. The effective action, expanded to second order in both the disorder potential and the bosonic field, naturally involves third- and fourth-order terms arising from the logarithmic expansion near $T_c$. This formalism, valid across the entire BCS-BEC crossover, reproduces the well-established BCS and BEC limits and yields self-energy expressions consistent with previous analyses for non-interacting point bosons and tightly bound fermion pairs. The approach applies equally to continuum and lattice systems and provides a natural framework for generalizations to multiband models.

Abstract: The kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ shows an unconventional interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. Tuning the band filling is known to rapidly suppress long-range CDW order and drive the formation of two superconducting ``domes" upon increasing hole concentration. Here we determine the detailed evolution of charge correlations across this phase diagram and resolve their interplay with the superconducting state. Upon light hole-doping, the suppression of a metastable $2\times 2\times 4$ CDW state coincides with the suppression of superconducting fluctuations present in the parent CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ compound. Continued doping suppresses long-range $2\times 2\times 2$ CDW order, leaving remnant short-range, quasi-1D correlations that persist across the second superconducting dome. These higher temperature charge correlations are seemingly essential to the lower temperature superconducting state, as charge correlations vanish coincident with superconductivity as a function of hole-doping. A multidomain model of short-range V-V dimer formation within the kagome plane is proposed in the second superconducting dome, where rotational and translational symmetry remain locally broken even in the absence of long-range CDW order.

Abstract: A series of Mn-doped CaKFe4As4 samples, CaK(Fe1-xMnx)4As4 with x values of 0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.05, are synthesized using two distinct routes: conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), and high gas-pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method. Comprehensive characterizations are performed on these samples to investigate their superconducting properties. This study examines the effects of Mn substitution at Fe sites in the FeAs layer on the superconducting properties of the CaKFe4As4 (1144) material. The HP-HTS process improves the microstructure and phase purity of the parent sample (x = 0), resulting in an enhanced superconducting transition temperature (Tc). In contrast, Mn doping via the CSP method in CaKFe4As4 reduces the sample quality and superconducting performance. Notably, the high-pressure synthesis method leads to an increase in the Tc by 3 to 7 K, particularly at low Mn concentrations. While the critical current density (Jc) of the parent sample (x = 0) shows a significant enhancement under the applied magnetic fields, Jc decreases for Mn-doped CaKFe4As4 bulks. These results demonstrate that high-pressure synthesis is an effective approach to improve the superconducting properties of Mn-doped 1144 compounds.

Abstract: It is well known that the electronic structure of hole-doped cuprate superconductors is tunable through both chemical doping and external pressure, which frequently offer us new insights of understanding on the high-Tc superconducting mechanism. While, for electron-doped cuprate superconductors, although the chemical doping effects have been systematically and thoroughly investigated, there is still a notable lack of experimental evidence regarding the pressure-driven coevolution of Tc and electronic structure. In this study, we report the first observation on the signatures of pressure-induced Lifshitz transition in Pr0.87LaCe0.13CuO4+delta (PLCCO) single crystal, a typical electron-doped cuprate superconductor, through the comprehensive high-pressure measurements of electrical resistance, Hall coefficient (RH) and synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD). Our results reveal that, at 40 K, the ambient-pressure RH with a significantly negative value decreases with increasing pressure until it reaches zero at a critical pressure (Pc ~ 10 GPa). Meanwhile, the corresponding Tc exhibits a slight variation within this pressure range. As pressure is further increased beyond Pc, RH changes its sign from negative to positive and then shows a slight increase, while Tc displays a continuous decrease. Our XRD measurements at 40 K demonstrate that no crystal structure phase transition occurs across the Pc. These results reveal that applying pressure to PLCCO can induce a Lifshitz transition at Pc, manifesting the reconstruction of the Fermi surface (FS), which turns the superconductivity toward fading out. Our calculation further reinforces the Fermi surface reconstruction from electron-dominated to hole-dominated ones at around Pc. These findings provide new evidence that highlights the strong correlation between the superconductivity and the Fermi surface topology in the electron-doped cuprates.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: For the BCS theory of superconductivity, the electron-phonon interaction is transformed to an attractive electron-electron interaction in the vicinity of the Fermi energy only. At the same time, its formal derivation using a unitary transformation reveals that the electrons attract one another whenever their energies do not differ more than the phonon energy $ω_\mathrm{D}$, independent of closeness to the Fermi energy. Consequently, the order parameter becomes finite even away from the Fermi level. Yet, for small interactions, its magnitude is usually small and can be safely ignored, justifying the BCS approximation. Intriguingly, we find that an accumulation of density-of-states at an energy $\varepsilon_\mathrm{peak}$ in proximity to the Fermi energy induces a significant order parameter magnitude around $\varepsilon_\mathrm{peak}$, which exceeds the one at $E_\mathrm{F}$ for moderate coupling strengths. This strong enhancement is heralded by the softening of an additional collective mode, which resembles a second phase transition. We predict measurable signatures in the thermodynamic and spectroscopic response of this unexpected phenomenon, guiding future experimental searches for it.

TL;DR: Atomic-scale engineering in cuprate superlattices controls superconductivity properties, validated by high-field magneto transport measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the superconducting properties and validate the two-band superconductivity theory in AHTS designed via quantum material engineering.

Method: High-field magneto transport measurements up to 41 Tesla were conducted on cuprate artificial high-temperature superlattices (AHTS) to analyze the superconducting dome behavior.

Result: The measurements revealed universal upward-concave behavior of the temperature-dependent upper critical magnetic field, supporting the multigap theory for SNSN superlattices.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that atomic-scale engineering in cuprate superlattices controls both critical temperature and intrinsic pair size, advancing next-generation quantum devices and understanding of unconventional superconductivity.

Abstract: It is known that cuprate artificial high temperature superlattices (AHTS) with period d, composed of quantum wells confining interface space charge in stoichiometric Mott insulator layers (S), with thickness L, at the interface with overdoped normal metallic cuprate layers (N) show a superconducting dome by tuning the geometric L over d ratio of the SNSN superlattice with the top predicted by quantum material design engineering quantum size effects. Here we report high-field magneto transport measurements up to 41 Tesla of AHTS across the entire superconducting dome. The results show the universal upward-concave behavior of the temperature dependent upper critical magnetic field in low critical temperature samples at rising edge and drop edge of the dome providing compelling evidence for two-band superconductivity in agreement with multigap theory used for quantum design of the SNSN superlattices. The measured superconducting coherence length demonstrates that atomic-scale engineering controls not only the critical temperature but also the intrinsic pair size at Fano-Feshbach resonances physics paving the way toward next generation quantum devices and shedding light on unconventional superconductivity.

*Anton V. Khvalyuk,Mikhail V. Feigel'man*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: A theoretical model explains ac dissipation in disordered superconductors with a pseudogap, predicting unique frequency and temperature dependencies due to localized collective modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the anomalous temperature and frequency dependence of ac dissipation in strongly disordered superconductors, which exhibit a pseudogap in the single-particle spectrum.

Method: A theoretical framework is developed to model the ac dissipation in strongly disordered superconductors with a pseudogap, focusing on the low-temperature and low-frequency regime. The analysis involves studying the quality factor of microwave resonators and identifying a new type of bulk localized collective modes.

Result: The theory reveals that low-frequency dissipation is dominated by bulk localized collective modes, leading to a sharp frequency-dependent decrease in the quality factor and a distinctive temperature dependence.

Conclusion: The theory developed explains the temperature and frequency dependence of ac dissipation in strongly disordered superconductors, predicting a sharp decrease in the quality factor with frequency and a two-level-system-like growth with temperature. It is applicable to materials like InOₓ, TiN, and NbN, and suggests similar physics for granular Aluminum films.

Abstract: We develop a theory of the temperature $T$ and frequency $ω$ dependence of ac dissipation in strongly disordered superconductors featuring a pseudogap $Δ_{P}$ in the single-particle spectrum. Our theory applies to the regime $T,\,\hbarω\llΔ_{\text{typ}}\llΔ_{P}$, where $Δ_{\text{typ}}$ is the typical superconducting gap. The dissipation is expressed in terms of the quality factor $Q(T,ω)$ of microwave resonators made of these materials. We show that low-$ω$ dissipation is dominated by a new type of bulk localized collective modes. Due to the strongly nonuniform spectral density of these modes, $Q$ decreases sharply with frequency, while its temperature dependence exhibits a two-level-system-like growth as a function of $T$ for $T\ll T_{c}$. Our theory is applicable to InO$_x$, TiN, NbN, and similar strongly disordered materials. We further argue that the experimentally observed behavior of disordered films of granular Aluminum is explained by similar physics, although this case requires a separate theoretical analysis.

Motivation: 探究超导薄膜中涡旋钉扎势能的统计特性，特别是其对无序性和核心变形的响应。

Method: 研究采用随机温度Ginzburg-Landau泛函描述超导薄膜中的内在不均匀性，通过计算涡旋核心对随机性的适应方式推导钉扎势能景观$E(\mathbf{R})$。

Result: 在弱无序条件下，钉扎势能景观为高斯统计，最小值间距显著大于涡旋核心尺寸$ξ$；核心变形后，统计特性变为非高斯，且最小值密度减小。

Conclusion: 在硬核近似下，钉扎势能景观表现出高斯统计特性，且最小值面密度由$n_\text{min}\approx(6ξ)^{-2}$给出。超越硬核近似后，钉扎势能统计变得非高斯，且核心变形导致最小值密度的相对幅度减小，其比例关系为$(T_c-T)^{-1/2}$。

Abstract: We investigate the statistical properties of the vortex pinning potential in a thin superconducting film. Modeling intrinsic inhomogeneities by a random-temperature Ginzburg-Landau functional with short-range Gaussian disorder, we derive the pinning landscape $E(\mathbf{R})$ by determining how the vortex core adapts to randomness. Within the hard-core approximation, applicable for weak disorder, the energy landscape exhibits Gaussian statistics. In this regime, the mean areal density of its minima is given by $n_\text{min}\approx(6ξ)^{-2}$, indicating that the typical spacing between neighboring minima is significantly larger than the vortex core size $ξ$. Going beyond the hard-core approximation, we allow the vortex order parameter to relax in response to the inhomogeneities. As a result, the pinning potential statistics become non-Gaussian. We calculate the leading correction due to the core deformation, which reduces the density of minima with a relative magnitude scaling as $(T_c-T)^{-1/2}$.

Abstract: This work presents a generalized period decomposition approach, significantly improving the practical reliability of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. Although Shor's algorithm theoretically enables polynomial-time integer factorization, its real-world performance heavily depends on stringent conditions related to the period obtained via quantum phase estimation. Our generalized decomposition method relaxes these conditions by systematically exploiting arbitrary divisors of the obtained period, effectively broadening the applicability of each quantum execution. Extensive classical simulations were performed to empirically validate our approach, involving over one million test cases across integers ranging from 2 to 8 digits. The proposed method achieved near-perfect success rates, exceeding 99.998% for 7-digit numbers and 99.999% for 8-digit numbers, significantly surpassing traditional and recently improved variants of Shor's algorithm. Crucially, this improvement is achieved without compromising the algorithm's polynomial-time complexity and integrates seamlessly with existing quantum computational frameworks. Moreover, our method enhances the efficiency of quantum resource usage by minimizing unnecessary repetitions, making it particularly relevant for quantum cryptanalysis with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study thus provides both theoretical advancements and substantial practical benefits, contributing meaningfully to the field of quantum algorithm research and the broader field of quantum information processing.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the Unitary Hitting Time Problem (UHTP) in quantum dynamics. Given computably described pure states |a>, |b> and a time-dependent unitary U(t), define the hitting time as the infimum of t > 0 such that the fidelity between U(t)|a> and |b> reaches a fixed threshold (with infinity if the threshold is never reached). We prove that there is no total algorithm that outputs this hitting time for all inputs; equivalently, the total UHTP is undecidable via a reduction from the halting problem. Operationally, we show a no-go theorem: for any fixed accuracy parameters, there is no universal finite-resource protocol that, for all computably described inputs, correctly outputs the hitting time while obeying uniform finite upper bounds on observation time and on dissipation/work. The proofs use reversible computation embedded into unitary dynamics, a fixed-target beacon construction, and a continuous-time lifting via piecewise-constant Hamiltonians. Our results target systems capable of embedding universal computation and complement prior undecidability results such as spectral-gap and quantum-control reachability. We distinguish logical time (inside the equations) from physical/operational time (of preparation, evolution, measurement), and show that universal time-step selection is impossible in both senses.

Motivation: KANs offer higher accuracy with fewer parameters but are slower as generators; the study aims to combine KAN with quantum advantages for better performance.

Method: A novel Generative Adversarial Network using Variational Quantum KAN as a generator, leveraging quantum circuits for efficient learning.

Result: Higher accuracy achieved on MNIST and CIFAR10 with fewer data compared to neural networks and Quantum GANs.

Conclusion: The proposed Generative Adversarial Variational Quantum KAN achieves higher accuracy than neural networks and Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks with fewer parameters.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks is a novel multilayer neuromorphic network that can exhibit higher accuracy than a neural network. It can learn and predict more accurately than neural networks with a smaller number of parameters, and many research groups worldwide have adopted it. As a result, many types of applications have been proposed. This network can be used as a generator solely or with a Generative Adversarial Network; however, KAN has a slower speed of learning than neural networks for the number of parameters. Hence,it has not been researched as a generator. Therefore, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network called Generative Adversarial Variational Quantum KAN that uses Variational Quantum KAN as a generator. This method enables efficient learning with significantly fewer parameters by leveraging the computational advantages of quantum circuits and their output distributions. We performed the training and generation task on MNIST and CIFAR10, and revealed that our method can achieve higher accuracy than neural networks and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network with less data.

Abstract: Quantifying intrinsic irreversibility in open quantum dynamics is central to understanding decoherence and information loss in many-body systems. In this work, we introduce the Choi echo, which provides an operational interpretation of the purity of the Choi state, the state representation of a quantum channel, as a quantifier of the robustness of quantum correlations against local information erasure. We employ this framework to analyze the reduced dynamics of a subsystem and to test whether local decoherence probes quantum chaos in many-body systems. Across paradigmatic spin chain models, we show that while the Choi echo captures key dynamical features, it also exhibits intrinsic limitations that, in certain regions of parameter space, restrict its ability to resolve the integrable-to-chaos transition at the level of spectral correlations. In particular, we demonstrate that local decoherence can spuriously signal quantum chaos in integrable regimes, tracing them to the inability of a strictly local probe to distinguish efficient coherent transport from genuinely scrambling dynamics. Our results show that local decoherence signals are controlled by the entanglement generated between the probe and its environment during the dynamics, rather than by spectral correlations, clarifying the practical scope of local dynamical diagnostics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose an information -- theoretic framework for quantifying Kochen-Specker contextuality. Two complementary measures are introduced: the mutual information energy, a state-independent quantity inspired by Onicescu's information energy that captures the geometric overlap between joint eigenspaces within a context; and an operational measure based on commutator expectation values that reflects contextual behavior at the level of measurement outcomes. We establish a hierarchy of bounds connecting these measures to the Robertson uncertainty relation, including spectral, purity-corrected, and operator norm estimates. The framework is applied to the Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario for spin-1 systems, where all quantities admit closed-form expressions. The Majorana-stellar representation furnishes a common geometric platform on which both the operational measure and the uncertainty products can be analyzed. For spin-1, this representation yields a three-dimensional Euclidean-like visualization of the Hilbert space in which, states lying on a plane exhibit maximum uncertainty for the observable along the perpendicular direction; simultaneous optimization across all KCBS contexts singles out a unique state on the symmetry axis. Notably, states achieving the optimal sum of uncertainty products exhibit vanishing operational contextuality, while states with substantial operational contextuality satisfy a nontrivial Robertson bound -- the two extremes are achieved by distinct quantum states.

Abstract: We investigate crystalline-like behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF) in unitary quantum systems with extremely strong eigenvalue repulsion. Using a low-temperature Coulomb gas as a model of repulsive eigenvalues, we derive the Debye-Waller factor suppressing periodic oscillations of the SFF and estimate the order of its singularities at multiples of the Heisenberg time. We also reproduce this crystalline-like behavior using perturbed permutation circuits and random matrix ensembles associated with Lax matrices. Our results lay a foundation for future studies of quantum systems that exhibit intermediate level statistics between standard random matrix ensembles and permutation circuits.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a framework to identify where the total correlations and entanglement with a chosen degree of freedom reside within the rest of a system, in the context of bosonic many-body Gaussian quantum systems. Our results are organized into two main propositions. First, for pure Gaussian states, we show that every correlated mode possesses a unique single-degree-of-freedom partner that fully captures its correlations (consisting of entanglement), and we provide an explicit construction of this partner from the complex structure of the system's state. Second, for mixed Gaussian states, we constructively demonstrate that the notion of a partner subsystem splits into two: a correlation partner, which contains all classical and quantum correlations and need not correspond to a single degree of freedom, and an entanglement partner, which is always at most single-mode. Finally, we extend the construction of partners to multi-mode subsystems. Together, these results provide conceptual practical tools to study how bipartite correlations and entanglement are structured and where they can be found in complex Gaussian many-body systems.

Abstract: We investigate the influence of the spin magnitude $S$ on the quantum Grüneisen parameter $Γ^{0\text{K}}_q$ right at critical points (CPs) for the 1D Ising model under a transverse magnetic field. Our findings are fourfold: $\textit{i)}$ for higher $S$, $Γ^{0\text{K}}_q$ is increased, but remains finite, reflecting the enhancement of the Hilbert space dimensionality; $\textit{ii)}$ the Schmidt decomposition theorem recovers the extensivity of the nonadditive $q$-entropy $S_q$ only for a $\textit{special}$ value of the entropic index $q$; $\textit{iii)}$ the universality class in the frame of $S_q$ depends only on the symmetry of the system; $\textit{iv)}$ we propose an experimental setup to explore finite size effects in connection with the Hilbert space occupation at CPs. Our findings unveil both universal and non-universal aspects of quantum criticality in terms of $Γ^{0\text{K}}_q$ and $S_q$.

Abstract: In this work, we consider a general feedback protocol based on quantum-jump detections, where the last detected jump channel is stored in a memory and subsequently used to implement a feedback action, such as modifying the system Hamiltonian conditioned on the last jump. We show that the time evolution of this general protocol can be described by a Lindblad master equation defined in a hybrid classical-quantum space, where the classical part encodes the stored measurement record (memory) and the quantum part represents the monitored system. Moreover, we show that this new representation can be used to fully characterize the counting statistics of a system subject to a general jump-based feedback protocol. We apply the formalism to a three-level system coupled to two thermal baths operating as a thermal machine, and we show that jump-based feedback can be used to convert the information obtained from the jump detections into work. Our framework provides analytical tools that enable the characterization of key statistical properties of any counting observable under jump-based feedback, such as the average current, noise, correlation functions, and power spectrum.

Abstract: We present a fully digital framework that replicates the statistical behavior of coherent-state quantum random number generation (QRNG) by harnessing system timing jitter through random permutation processes. Our approach transforms computational timing variations from hardware and operating system sources into permutation dynamics that generate Poisson-distributed numbers, accurately reproducing the photon statistics of optical coherent states. The theoretical foundation is established by the Uniform Convergence Theorem, which provides exponential convergence to uniformity under modular projection with rigorous error bounds. Extensive experimental validation across multiple parameter regimes and sample sizes up to $10^8$ bytes demonstrates exceptional performance: Shannon entropy approaching 7.999998 bits/byte and min-entropy exceeding 7.99 bits/byte, outperforming theoretical bounds at scale. The architecture inherently resists side-channel attacks through compound timing distributions and adaptive permutation behavior, while operating without classical cryptographic post-processing. Our results establish that coherent-state QRNG functionality can be entirely realized through classical computational processes, delivering mathematically provable uniformity and practical cryptographic security without quantum photonic hardware.

In this work, we investigate the dependence of NQS on the choice of the computational basis, focusing on restricted Boltzmann machines. Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself. Our results provide insights that may be used to gauge the applicability of NQS to new problems and to identify the optimal basis for numerical computations.

Abstract: We show that the standard approach to characterize collective entanglement via genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) leads to an area law in ground and thermal Gibbs states of local Hamiltonians. To capture the truly collective part one needs to go beyond this short-range contribution tied to interfaces between subregions. Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME. This approach will allow to chart truly collective entanglement in quantum matter both in and out of equilibrium.

TL;DR: The paper explores the KvN equation's potential for classical systems, showing separable solutions, orthonormal superpositions, and classical uncertainty relations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend quantum mechanics techniques (e.g., eigenvalue problems, orthonormal eigenstates, superposition of states) to classical mechanics via the KvN framework.

Method: Analyzed the general KvN equation for classical probability amplitude, utilized gauge freedom to separate variables, and investigated Hilbert-space methods.

Result: Established separable solutions describing the canonical ensemble, derived orthonormal eigenstate superpositions, and identified classical uncertainty relations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the KvN formalism can leverage Hilbert-space methods to explore classical systems, revealing insights like classical uncertainty relations and the description of canonical ensembles.

Abstract: The Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formulation brings classical mechanics to Hilbert space, but many techniques familiar from quantum mechanics remain missing. One would hope to solve eigenvalue problems, obtain orthonormal eigenstates of Hermitian operators and ascribe meaning to a coherent superposition of states, among other things. Here we consider the general KvN equation for a classical probability amplitude and show that its so-called gauge freedom allows the separation of variables. The amenability to Hilbert-space methods of the resulting KvN solutions is investigated. We construct superpositions from differently-gauged Liouvillian eigenstates, and find an orthonormal set among them. We find that some separable solutions describe the canonical ensemble with temperature related to the separation constant. Classical uncertainty relations arise naturally in the KvN formalism. We discuss one between the dynamical time and the Liouvillian in terms of the statistical description of classical systems.

Abstract: Unlike discrete photonic circuits, which manipulate photons step-by-step using a series of optical elements, arrays of coupled waveguides enable photons to interfere continuously across the entire structure. When composed of a nonlinear material, such arrays can also directly generate quantum states of light within the circuit. To clarify the similarities and distinctions between these two approaches of quantum walks, we conduct here a systematic comparison between linear waveguide arrays, injected with photons produced externally, and nonlinear arrays, where photon pairs are continuously generated via parametric down-conversion. We experimentally validate these predictions using III-V semiconductor nonlinear waveguide lattices with varied geometries, enabling us to tune the depth of the quantum walks over an order of magnitude and reveal the gradual emergence of non-classicality in the output state. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse-design approach to engineer \textit{aperiodic} waveguide arrays, whose optimized coupling profiles generate maximally entangled states such as the biphoton W-state. These results highlight the potential of continuously-coupled photonic systems to harness high-dimensional entanglement within compact architectures.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms suffer from barren plateaus, where gradients vanish with system size and circuit depth. Although many mitigation strategies exist, their connection to convergence performance under different iteration budgets remains unclear. Moreover, a systematic analysis identifying which state-of-the-art mitigation techniques perform best under specific scenarios is also lacking. We benchmark four approaches, Local-Global, Adiabatic, State Efficient Ansatz (SEA), and Pretrained VQE, against standard VQE on molecular systems from 4 to 14 qubits, analyzing gradient variance up to 50 layers and convergence over 1000 iterations. Our results show that the impact of gradient preservation is iteration-dependent. In the 14-qubit BeH2 system, Pretrained VQE outperforms SEA at 100 iterations despite lower gradient variance, but SEA becomes 2.2x more accurate at 1000 iterations. For smaller systems, SEA achieves near-exact energies (H2: 10^-5 Ha, LiH: 2x10^-4 Ha) with fidelities 0.999, while standard methods plateau early. The results demonstrate that robust barren plateau mitigation depends on aligning the chosen strategy with both system size and available computational budget, rather than treating gradient variance as the sole predictor of performance.

TL;DR: The QCLE violates positivity in phase-space densities, especially for low-energy states, suggesting a need for a negativity index to validate its use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the limitations of the QCLE framework, especially its deviations from exact quantum dynamics in phase-space distributions.

Method: Comparison of phase-space distributions from exact quantum dynamics and QCLE evolution, using numerical and analytical results for low-dimensional models.

Result: Resonance effects differ between QCLE and exact dynamics, and the QCLE violates positivity for marginal densities in low-energy states.

Conclusion: The QCLE can violate the positivity of marginal phase-space densities, particularly for low-energy states. A negativity index may help assess its validity.

Abstract: The mixed quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) provides an approximate perturbative framework for describing the dynamics of systems with coupled quantum and classical degrees of freedom of disparate thermal wavelengths. The evolution governed by the Liouville operator preserves many properties of full quantum dynamics, including the conservation of total population, energy, and purity, and has shown quantitative agreement with exact quantum results for the expectation values of many observables where direct comparisons are feasible. However, since the QCLE density matrix operator is obtained from the partial Wigner transform of the full quantum density matrix, its matrix elements can have negative values, implying that the diagonal matrix elements behave as pseudo-densities rather than densities of classical phase space. Here, we compare phase-space distributions generated by exact quantum dynamics with those produced by QCLE evolution from pure quantum initial states. We show that resonance effects in the off-diagonal matrix elements differ qualitatively, particularly for low-energy states. Furthermore, numerical and analytical results for low-dimensional models reveal that the QCLE can violate the positivity of marginal phase-space densities, a property that should hold at all times for any physical system. A perturbative analysis of a model system confirms that such violations arise generically. We also show that the violations of positivity of the marginal densities vanish as the initial energy of the system increases relative to the energy gap between subsystem states. These findings suggest that a negativity index, quantifying deviations from positivity, may provide a useful metric for assessing the validity of mixed quantum\textendash{}classical descriptions.

Motivation: Nuclear spins are promising for quantum information but are challenging to address due to their weak coupling to the environment.

Method: Employing an electron-nuclear double resonance measurement scheme with a local scanning probe to resolve nuclear spin transitions of a single 47Ti isotope.

Result: Successful resolution of multiple NMR transitions on a single 47Ti isotope, consistent with eigenenergy calculations, showing efficient nuclear spin driving.

Conclusion: This investigation demonstrates the potential for direct control of nuclear spins in a long-lifetime regime, advancing applications in quantum information technology and characterization techniques.

Abstract: The nuclear spin is a prime candidate for quantum information applications due to its weak coupling to the environment and inherently long coherence times. However, this weak coupling also challenges the addressability of the nuclear spin. Here we demonstrate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on a single on-surface atom using a local scanning probe. We employ an electron-nuclear double resonance measurement scheme and resolve nuclear spin transitions of a single 47Ti isotope with a nuclear spin of I = 5/2. The quadrupole interaction enables to resolve multiple NMR transitions, which are consistent with our eigenenergy calculations. Our experimental results indicate that the nuclear spin can be driven efficiently irrespective of its hybridization with the electron spin, which is required for direct control of the nuclear spin in the long-lifetime regime. This investigation of NMR on a single atom in a platform with atomic-scale control is a valuable development for other platforms deploying nuclear spins for characterization techniques or quantum information technology.

Abstract: Noiseless linear amplifiers (NLAs) serve as an effective means to enable long-distance continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD), even under realistic conditions with non-unit reconciliation efficiency. Separately, unitary averaging has been suggested to mitigate some stochastic noise, including phase noise in continuous-variable states. In this work, we combine these two protocols to simultaneously compensate for thermal-loss effects and suppress phase noise, thereby enabling long-distance CV QKD that surpasses the repeaterless bound, the fundamental rate-distance limit, for repeaterless quantum communication systems.

Abstract: Around the turn of the century, Shor formulated his well-known and still-open conjecture stating that the accessible information of any quantum dichotomy, that is the maximum amount of classical information that can be decoded from a binary quantum encoding, is attained by a von Neumann measurement. A quarter of a century later, new developments on the Lorenz curves of quantum dichotomies in the field of quantum majorization and statistical comparison may provide the key to unlock such a longstanding open problem. Here, we first investigate the tradeoff relations between accessible information and guessing probability in the binary case, thus disproving the claimed monotonicity of the former quantity in the latter that, if true, would have settled Shor's problem in the qubit case. Our second result is to provide a state-dependent generalization of extremality for quantum measurements, to characterize state-dependent extremality for qubit dichotomies, and to apply such results to tighten previous results on the accessible information of qubit dichotomies.

Abstract: Quantum sensing is an emerging field with the potential to outperform classical methods in both precision and spatial resolution. However, the sensitivity of the underlying quantum platform also makes the sensors highly susceptible to their environmental noise. To address this issue, techniques from the field of quantum error mitigation use information about the noise to improve measurement results. We present a novel mitigation technique for quantum sensors to efficiently reverse the effects of any noise that can be described by a completely positive trace preserving map. The method leverages the knowledge acquired by a pre-characterization step of the device to automatically adapt to the complexity of the dissipative evolution and to indicate optimal sensing times $τ$ to achieve the most accurate results. We demonstrate that our method reaches the best achievable sensitivity in noisy single-NV-center magnetometry.
  This work marks a further step toward more resilient quantum sensors with the smallest scale of resolution.

Motivation: To enhance nanoscale quantum sensing by engineering shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond with improved depth confinement and density.

Method: Near-surface nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers were created through delta doping during diamond growth, enabling tunable control over NV depth confinement and density.

Result: Delta doping achieved a twofold improvement in NV depth confinement compared to low-energy ion implantation, producing highly-sensitive single defects and ensembles with coherence limited by NV-NV interactions. The method was validated by imaging magnetism in few-layer CrSBr.

Conclusion: The control provided by near-surface delta doping opens new possibilities for NV quantum sensing, from nanoscale NMR to entanglement-enhanced metrology.

Abstract: Engineering shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond holds the key to unlocking new advances in nanoscale quantum sensing. We find that the creation of near-surface NVs through delta doping during diamond growth allows for tunable control over both NV depth confinement (with a twofold improvement relative to low-energy ion implantation) and NV density, ultimately resulting in highly-sensitive single defects and ensembles with coherence limited by NV-NV interactions. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of our shallow delta-doped NVs by imaging magnetism in few-layer CrSBr, a two-dimensional magnet. We anticipate that the control afforded by near-surface delta doping will enable new developments in NV quantum sensing from nanoscale NMR to entanglement-enhanced metrology.

Abstract: Modern navigation systems rely heavily on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), whose weak spaceborne signals are vulnerable to jamming, spoofing, and line-of-sight blockage. As an alternative, the Earth's magnetic field entails location information and is found critical to many animals' cognitive and navigation behavior. However, the practical use of the Earth's magnetic field for geo-localization hinges on an ultra-sensitive magnetometer. This work investigates how quantum magnetic sensing can be used for this purpose. We theoretically derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the estimation error of quantum sensing when using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and prove the quantum advantage over classical magnetometers. Moreover, we employ a practical distributed quantum sensing protocol to saturate CRLB. Based on the estimated magnetic field and the earth's magnetic field map, we formulate geo-localization as a map-matching problem and introduce a coarse-to-fine Mahalanobis distance search in both gradient space (local field derivatives) and corner space (raw field samples). We simulate the proposed quantum sensing-based geo-localization framework over four cities in the United States and Canada. The results report that in high-gradient regions, gradient-space Mahalanobis search achieves sub-kilometer median localization error; while in magnetically smoother areas, corner-space search provides better accuracy and a $4-8\times$ reduction in runtime.

Abstract: We introduce an unsupervised machine-learning framework that discovers optimally compressed representations of quantum many-body ground states. Using an autoencoder neural network architecture on data from $L$-site Fermi-Hubbard models, we identify minimal latent spaces with a sharp reconstruction quality threshold at $L-1$ latent dimensions, matching the system's intrinsic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the use of the trained decoder as a differentiable variational ansatz to minimize energy directly within the latent space. Crucially, this approach circumvents the $N$-representability problem, as the learned manifold implicitly restricts the optimization to physically valid quantum states.

Abstract: Quantum state verification plays a vital role in many quantum cryptographic protocols, as it allows the use of quantum states from untrusted sources. While some progress has been made in this direction, the question of whether the most prevalent type of quantum state verification, namely cut-and-choose verification, can be efficient and secure, is still not answered in full generality. In this work, we show a fundamental limit for quantum state verification for all cut-and-choose approaches used to verify arbitrary quantum states. We provide a no-go result showing that the cut-and-choose techniques cannot lead to quantum state verification protocols that are both efficient in the number of rounds and secure. We show this trade-off for stand-alone and composable security, where the scaling of the lower bound for the security parameters renders cut-and-choose quantum state verification effectively unusable.

Abstract: Quantum Krylov algorithms have emerged as a useful framework for quantum simulations in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, offering a favorable trade-off between potential quantum speedups and practical resource demands. However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($Δt$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $Δt$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $ε\to 0$ of the error parameter $ε$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $ε\neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($ε^2$) vs O($Δt$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $ε$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $ε$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage.

Abstract: Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing causes global economic losses of \$10-25 billion annually and undermines marine sustainability and governance. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides reliable maritime surveillance under all weather and lighting conditions, but classifying small maritime objects in SAR imagery remains challenging. We investigate quantum machine learning for this task, focusing on Quantum Kernel Methods (QKMs) applied to real and complex SAR chips extracted from the SARFish dataset. We tackle two binary classification problems, the first for distinguishing vessels from non-vessels, and the second for distinguishing fishing vessels from other types of vessels. We compare QKMs applied to real and complex SAR chips against classical Laplacian, RBF, and linear kernels applied to real SAR chips. Using noiseless numerical simulations of the quantum kernels, we find that QKMs are capable of obtaining equal or better performance than the classical kernel on these tasks in the best case, but do not demonstrate a clear advantage for the complex SAR data. This work presents the first application of QKMs to maritime classification in SAR imagery and offers insight into the potential and current limitations of quantum-enhanced learning for maritime surveillance.

Abstract: We study the limitations for defining spatial and temporal intervals when the only available reference frame is a single composite quantum system, whose internal degrees of freedom serve as a temporal reference, a clock, and whose center of mass degrees of freedom act as a spatial reference, a rod. By combining quantum speed limits with the mass energy equivalence of special relativity, we show that spatial localizability and temporal resolution are not independent: sharpening one inevitably blurs the other. Specifically, the internal energy coherence needed for precise timekeeping affects the center of mass dynamics, enhancing position spreading during free evolution. As a result, a single composite system cannot act as a perfect quantum reference frame for both space and time, leading to a Heisenberg like uncertainty relation between spatial and temporal intervals. After analyzing this trade off from an external perspective, we formulate it in a purely relational manner, by means of covariant observables relative to the space time quantum reference frame, uncovering an additional intrinsic uncertainty of order the Compton wavelength of the frame.

Motivation: The goal is to simulate large-scale many-fermion systems efficiently on digital quantum hardware, leveraging local fermion-to-qubit encodings to bypass hardware-level fermionic statistics enforcement.

Method: The paper explores local fermion-to-qubit encodings and proposes a new framework for digital implementations of time-evolution unitaries using flow sets, which are subsets of the fermionic interaction graph.

Result: The study finds that local fermionic encodings, when restricted to flow sets, adopt a simple structure that can be systematically classified. Efficient quantum circuits for time-evolution unitaries are proposed, demonstrating a space-time trade-off.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the proposed framework for digital implementations of qubit-encoded fermionic time-evolution unitaries using flow sets offers a systematic classification and efficient quantum circuit decompositions.

Abstract: Simulating the dynamical properties of large-scale many-fermion systems is a longstanding goal of quantum chemistry, material science and condensed matter. Local fermion-to-qubit encodings have opened a new path for practical fermionic simulations on digital quantum hardware where fermionic statistics are not enforced at the hardware level. In this paper, we explore these local encodings from the perspective of the corresponding time-evolution unitaries. Specifically, we propose a new framework for digital implementations of these qubit-encoded fermionic time-evolution unitaries based on \emph{flow sets}, which are one-dimensional subsets of the directed fermionic interaction graph. We find that any local fermionic encoding, when restricted to a given flow set, adopts a simple structure that we can classify systematically. For each categorized flow-set form, we propose a low-depth qubit quantum circuit that implements the time evolution unitary using the stabilizer formalism. As an application of our construction, we introduce novel flow-based decompositions for known two-dimensional encodings, leading to efficient circuit decompositions of time-evolution unitaries. We generally observe a space-time trade-off, where mappings with larger qubit-to-fermion ratios yield shallower time-evolution quantum circuits.

Abstract: Interesting new correlation and unidirectional properties of two bosonic modes under the influence of environment appear when the modes are mutually coupled through the simultaneously applied linear mode-hopping and nonlinear squeezing interactions. Under such double coupling, it is found that while the Hamiltonian of the system is clearly Hermitian the dynamics of the quadrature components of the field operators can be attributed to non-Hermicity of the system. It is manifested in an asymmetric coupling between the quadrature components which then leads to a variety of remarkable features. In particular, we identify how the emerging exceptional point controls the conversion of thermal states of the modes into single-mode classically or quantum squeezed states. Furthermore, for reservoirs being in squeezed states, we find that the two-photon correlations present in these reservoirs are responsible for unidirectional flow of populations and correlations among the modes and the flow can be controlled by appropriate tuning of the mutual orientation of the squeezed noise ellipses. In the course of analyzing these effects we find that the flow of the population creates the first-order coherence between the modes which, on the other hand rules out an enhancement of the two photon correlations responsible for entanglement between the modes. These results suggest new alternatives for the creation of single mode squeezed fields and the potential applications for controlled unidirectional transfer of population and correlations in bosonic chains.

Abstract: In a paper, Al-Qasimi [Physics Letters A 449 (2022) 128347] studied contextuality of two-qubit states using an argument by Peres [Phys. Lett. A 151 (1990) 107]. For two-qubit system in the Werner state, Al-Qasimi argued that only when discord is zero, the system is noncontextual. Here I point out that this argument is false and the related work in C. Jebarathinam and R. Srikanth [Int. J. Quantum Inf. https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219749925500376 (arXiv:2403.01762v2)].

Motivation: To explore quantum signal processing by leveraging quantum circuits for pointwise multiplication and convolution of complex functions.

Result: Demonstration of pointwise product and convolution construction using quantum states, integration into an extended quantum audio package, and experimental validation.

Conclusion: This work offers a promising avenue for quantum signal processing, with potential applications in areas such as quantum-enhanced audio manipulation and synthesis.

Abstract: This paper introduces quantum circuit methodologies for pointwise multiplication and convolution of complex functions, conceptualized as "processing through encoding". Leveraging known techniques, we describe an approach where multiple complex functions are encoded onto auxiliary qubits. Applying the proposed scheme for two functions $f$ and $g$, their pointwise product $f(x)g(x)$ is shown to naturally form as the coefficients of part of the resulting quantum state. Adhering to the convolution theorem, we then demonstrate how the convolution $f*g$ can be constructed. Similarly to related work, this involves the encoding of the Fourier coefficients $\mathcal{F}[f]$ and $\mathcal{F}[g]$, which facilitates their pointwise multiplication, followed by the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform. We discuss the simulation of these techniques, their integration into an extended \verb|quantumaudio| package for audio signal processing, and present initial experimental validations. This work offers a promising avenue for quantum signal processing, with potential applications in areas such as quantum-enhanced audio manipulation and synthesis.

Abstract: We revisit the Bell--CHSH scenario for two spin-\(\tfrac{1}{2}\) particles and isolate the precise algebraic origin of the Bell contradiction. On the quantum side, spin-\(\tfrac{1}{2}\) is described by a noncommutative spinor (Clifford) algebra acting on the Hilbert space of two spin-\(\tfrac{1}{2}\) particles, with the singlet state yielding the usual correlation \(E(a,b) = -\,a\cdot b\) and Tsirelson's bound \(2\sqrt{2}\). On the classical side, the standard Bell assumptions amount to describing all measurement outcomes as \(\{\pm1\}\)-valued random variables on a single Kolmogorov probability space, i.e.\ elements of a commutative algebra \(\mathcal{C}(Λ)\).
  We show that there is no representation of the spinor algebra of spin-\(\tfrac{1}{2}\) (with its singlet state and locality structure) into any such commutative Kolmogorov algebra that preserves the \(\{\pm1\}\) spectra of local spin components and the singlet correlations entering the CHSH expression, under the standard Bell assumptions of locality (factorization) and measurement independence. In this sense, the Bell--CHSH contradiction is exhibited as an algebraic mismatch between a noncommutative spinor/Clifford description of spin and the classical assumption of a single global Kolmogorov space supporting all outcomes. In the language of quantum probability, this is a C\(^*\)-algebraic reformulation of the known fact that the singlet correlations admit no local hidden-variable model with jointly distributed outcomes on one probability space.
  We also give an explicit realization of the same spinor structure within the author's Quantum Index Algebra (QIA) framework, where locality appears as disjoint index slots and the singlet state as a simple index cocycle.

Abstract: We present different characterizations of the notion of irreducibility for Quantum Markov Semigroups (QMSs) and investigate its relationship with other relevant features of the dynamics, such as primitivity, positivity improvement and relaxation; in particular, we show that irreducibility, primitivity and relaxation towards a faithful invariant density are equivalent when the semigroup admits an invariant density. Moreover, in the case of uniformly continuous QMSs, we present several useful ways of checking irreducibility in terms of the operators appearing in the generator in GKLS form. Our exposition is as much self-contained as possible, we present some well known results with elementary proofs (collecting all the relevant literature) and we derive new ones. We study both finite and infinite dimensional evolutions and we remark that many results only require the QMS to be made of Schwarz maps.

Motivation: To understand why macroscopic quantum superpositions are unobservable despite perfect isolation.

Method: Analyzing distinguishability measures and quantifiers of macroscopic quantumness using the GHZ state as an example.

Result: Generic many-body evolution renders macroscopic superpositions and classical mixtures operationally indistinguishable for most times.

Conclusion: Equilibration under unitary thermalization suppresses macroscopic quantum effects, independent of environmental decoherence.

Abstract: Macroscopic quantum superpositions are widely believed to be unobservable because large systems cannot be perfectly isolated from their environments. Here, we show that even under perfect isolation, intrinsic unitary dynamics with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis suppress the observable signatures of macroscopic coherence. Using the GHZ state as a representative example, we demonstrate that while fully correlated measurements can initially distinguish a macroscopic superposition from its corresponding classical mixture, generic many-body evolution renders them operationally indistinguishable for most times during the evolution. By analyzing both distinguishability measures and established quantifiers of macroscopic quantumness, we find that equilibration not only hides coherence from accessible observables but also suppresses macroscopic superpositions themselves. These results identify unitary thermalization, independent of environmental decoherence, as a fundamental mechanism that limits the emergence of macroscopic quantum effects.

Method: 论文的主要技术包括算法版本的Holevo-Helstrom测量和Uhlmann变换，这些技术可在量子线性空间中实现。此外，利用了Le Gall等人提出的空间高效量子奇异值变换来确保多项式时间复杂性。

Result: 论文的主要结果是证明了QSZK的上界可以改进为$\mathsf{QIP(2)} \cap \text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$，同时展示了类似的改进适用于非交互变体$\mathsf{NIQSZK}$。

Conclusion: 论文的结论是通过应用算法版本的Holevo-Helstrom测量和Uhlmann变换，将量子统计零知识（QSZK）的上界改进为$\mathsf{QIP(2)} \cap \text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$，并证明了这一改进同样适用于非交互变体$\mathsf{NIQSZK}$。

Abstract: The complexity class Quantum Statistical Zero-Knowledge ($\mathsf{QSZK}$), introduced by Watrous (FOCS 2002) and later refined in Watrous (SICOMP, 2009), has the best known upper bound $\mathsf{QIP(2)} \cap \text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$, which was simplified following the inclusion $\mathsf{QIP(2)} \subseteq \mathsf{PSPACE}$ established in Jain, Upadhyay, and Watrous (FOCS 2009). Here, $\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ denotes the class of promise problems that admit two-message quantum interactive proof systems in which the honest prover is typically \textit{computationally unbounded}, and $\text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ denotes the complement of $\mathsf{QIP(2)}$.
  We slightly improve this upper bound to $\mathsf{QIP(2)} \cap \text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ with a quantum linear-space honest prover. A similar improvement also applies to the upper bound for the non-interactive variant $\mathsf{NIQSZK}$. Our main techniques are an algorithmic version of the Holevo-Helstrom measurement and the Uhlmann transform, both implementable in quantum linear space, implying polynomial-time complexity in the state dimension, using the recent space-efficient quantum singular value transformation of Le Gall, Liu, and Wang (CC, to appear).

Motivation: To study the Casimir-Polder interaction for atoms near cylindrical fibers with hollow cores, focusing on how geometrical and material-related length scales characterize the interaction.

Method: A flexible and fast-converging numerical scheme was developed to evaluate the interaction, supported by detailed analytical investigations.

Result: The Casimir-Polder potential distinguishes between ohmic and non-ohmic conductors, with the shell thickness playing a significant role in controlling the interaction.

Conclusion: The shell thickness is identified as a key parameter for controlling the Casimir-Polder interaction, offering potential applications in fundamental physics and quantum technologies.

Abstract: The Casimir-Polder force acts on polarizable particles due to quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field that are modified by the presence of material bodies. We investigate the Casimir-Polder interaction for atoms near cylindrical fibers with hollow cores. This geometry represents one of the archetypal configurations encountered in numerous experimental setups designed to control and manipulate atoms in fundamental and quantum technological applications. Specifically, we analyze how the interplay of both geometrical and material-related length scales characterize the interaction, emphasizing the impact of the shell thickness. We develop a flexible and fast-converging numerical scheme for evaluating the interaction over a wide range of atom-cylinder separations at both zero and finite temperature. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analytical investigation of how various material properties modify the Casimir-Polder potential. Finally, we analyze and discuss a number of limiting cases and compare numerical computations with corresponding analytical asymptotic expressions. In particular, in this geometry the Casimir-Polder potential is able to distinguish between an ohmic and non-ohmic description of conductors. One of the most significant outcomes of our work is that the shell thickness emerges as a useful parameter for controlling the interaction, opening avenues for both fundamental physics and applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Open quantum systems play a central role in contemporary nanoscale technologies, including molecular electronics, quantum heat engines, quantum computation and information processing. A major theoretical challenge is to construct dynamical models that are simultaneously consistent with classical thermodynamics and complete positivity. In this work, we develop a framework that addresses this issue by extending classical stochastic dynamics to the quantum domain. We begin by formulating a generalized Langevin equation in which both friction and noise act symmetrically on the two Hamiltonian equations. From this, we derive a generalized Klein-Kramers equation expressed in terms of Poisson brackets, and we show that it admits the Boltzmann distribution as its stationary solution while satisfying the first and second laws of thermodynamics along individual trajectories. Applying canonical quantization to this classical framework yields two distinct quantum master equations, depending on whether the friction operators are taken to be Hermitian or non-Hermitian. By analyzing the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the conditions under which these equations reduce to a Lindblad-type generator. Our results demonstrate that complete positivity is ensured only when friction and noise are included in both Hamiltonian equations, thus fully justifying the classical construction. Moreover, we find that the friction coefficients must satisfy the same positivity condition in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian formulations, revealing a form of universality that transcends the specific operator representation. The formalism offers a versatile tool for deriving quantum versions of the thermodynamic laws and is directly applicable to a wide class of nonequilibrium nanoscale systems.

Conclusion: DAQC框架中的这一改进结果表明，通过紧密的时间边界估计，可以更精确地评估量子模拟和量子算法的时间资源需求，从而促进与其他方法的严格比较。

Abstract: Digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) is a universal computational paradigm that combines the evolution under an entangling Hamiltonian with the application of single-qubit gates. Since any unitary operation can be decomposed into a sequence of evolutions generated by two-body Hamiltonians, DAQC is inherently well-suited for realizing such operations. Suboptimal upper bounds for the total time required to perform these evolutions have been previously proposed. Here, we improve these limits by providing a tight bound for this crucial parameter, which shows a linear dependence with the number of couplings. This result enables a precise estimation of the time resources needed for quantum simulations and quantum algorithms implemented within the DAQC framework, facilitating a rigorous comparison with other approaches.

Abstract: We demonstrate polarization-entangled biphotons in a cold-atom double-$Λ$ system, overcoming atomic selection rules that suppress polarization correlations and favor orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement. Using spatial light modulators, we coherently map a selected two-dimensional OAM subspace onto the polarization basis and thereby open an otherwise inaccessible polarization channel. Quantum-state tomography confirms that the mapping preserves the biphoton coherence. The four polarization Bell states are generated with fidelities of $92\text{-}94\%$ with few-percent statistical uncertainties, and an average Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt parameter of $S=2.44$ verifies the survival of nonlocal correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first demonstration of OAM-to-polarization entanglement transfer in a cold-atom spontaneous four-wave mixing platform and establishes a practical interface for integrating atomic OAM resources with polarization-based quantum communication networks.

Abstract: Entangled photon sources (EPSs) are essential building blocks for scalable quantum communication and quantum key distribution (QKD). We present a stable, highly nondegenerate EPS based on type-0 spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a crossed-crystal configuration, generating photon pairs at 680~nm and 1550~nm when pumped by a 473~nm laser. This wavelength combination, reported here for the first time, simultaneously benefits from the peak detection efficiency of the most of the Si-SPADs in the visible/near-infrared spectral range and the low-loss fiber transmission of the telecom C-band. This configuration provides the most favorable balance between performance and cost for detection using Si-SPADs and InGaAs detectors. The source exhibits a measured spectral bandwidth of 300~GHz, corresponding to a spectral brightness of up to $1.9\times 10^3$~pairs~s$^{-1}$~mW$^{-1}$~GHz$^{-1}$. Heralding efficiencies reach 18~\% (signal) and 34~\% (idler) with Si-SPAD and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD) detection. The entangled state achieves visibilities of $(97.3\pm 1.0)\,\%$ in the H/V basis and $(94.9\pm1.6)\,\%$ in the D/A basis, yielding a fidelity of $\geq(96.1\pm1.3)\,\%$. These results establish the presented EPS as a practical wavelength-hybrid platform for fiber-based QKD and emerging long-haul quantum network architectures.

Abstract: Optically levitated nanoparticles are promising candidates for the generation of macroscopic quantum states of mechanical motion. Protocols to generate such states expose the particle to a succession of different potentials. Limited reproducibility of the alignment of these potentials across experimental realizations introduces additional noise. Here, we experimentally investigate and model how such shot-to-shot noise limits the coherence length of a levitated nanoparticle during a state-expansion protocol using a dark, inverted electrical potential. We identify electric stray fields and mechanical instabilities as major sources of shot-to-shot fluctuations. We discuss the resulting experimental requirements for state expansion protocols exploiting inverted potentials.

Motivation: Addressing the computational challenges of kernel calculations in high-dimensional datasets by leveraging quantum Kerr nonlinearity.

Method: Implemented time-dependent simulations of a Kerr-qubit coupled to acoustic resonators to design and analyze a quantum-enhanced kernel.

Result: Non-classical behavior in the multimode system was observed, enabling the definition and analysis of a quantum-enhanced kernel.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the computational intractability of classically simulating the quantum-enhanced kernel as the number of resonators scales, highlighting the potential of quantum Kerr nonlinearity for machine learning applications.

Abstract: The kernel trick is a widely applicable technique in machine learning domains that maps datasets that are difficult to classify into a computationally friendly feature space. As the dimension of the dataset scales, these kernel calculations can quickly become computationally intractable or data inefficient. In this work, we extend prior efforts in quantum kernel design for Kerr nonlinear devices by implementing time-dependent simulations of a Kerr-qubit coupled to acoustic resonators. For experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that the Kerr nonlinearity directly induces non-classical behavior in the multimode system, which we use to define and analyze a quantum-enhanced kernel. Finally, we present a brief scaling characterization that demonstrates the computational intractability of classically simulating the kernel as the number of resonators scales.

Abstract: Designing optimal control for multiparameter quantum sensing is essential for approaching the ultimate precision limits. However, analytical solutions are generally available only for simple systems, while realistic scenarios often involve coupled qubits and time-dependent Hamiltonians. Here we numerically investigate optimal control of a two-qubit sensor-ancilla system coupled via an Ising term using Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) to minimize the objective function. By seeding the optimization recursively with solutions obtained for smaller coupling strengths and selecting a suitable initial guess, we achieve robust convergence and high precision across a wide range of interaction strengths and field configurations. The proposed approach offers a practical route toward high-sensitivity, robust multiparameter magnetometry and it is applicable to solid-state quantum sensors such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in realistic experimental settings.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional tight-binding lattice driven by a spatially quadratic and time-periodic potential. Both Hermitian ($J_1 = J_2$) and non-Hermitian ($J_1 \neq J_2$) hopping regimes are analyzed. Within the framework of Floquet theory, the time-dependent Hamiltonian is mapped onto an effective static Floquet Hamiltonian, enabling a detailed study of the quasi-energy spectrum and eigenstate localization as function of the driving frequency $ω$. We identify critical frequencies $ω_c$ at which nearly equidistant quasi-energy ladders emerge, characterized by a pronounced minimum in the normalized variance of level spacings. This spectral regularity, which coincides with a peak in the mean inverse participation ratio (\textrm{MIPR}), leads to robust periodic revivals and Bloch-like oscillations in the time evolution. Numerical simulations confirm that such coherent oscillations persist even in the non-Hermitian regime, where the periodic driving stabilizes an almost real and uniformly spaced quasi-energy ladder.

Abstract: In the transmitter of a quantum key distribution (QKD) system, a dense wavelength-division multiplexer (DWDM) is typically used to combine quantum and synchronization signals and is directly connected to the quantum channel. As a result, it becomes the first optical component exposed to laser-injection attacks. Therefore, understanding the behavior of DWDMs under such attacks is essential for assessing the practical security of QKD systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the characteristics of DWDMs under high-power laser illumination. Our experimental results show that certain DWDM samples exhibit pronounced changes in their spectral features once the injected laser power surpasses a specific threshold. Taking the Trojan-horse attack as an illustrative example, we further perform a theoretical analysis of the resulting spectral side channel and show that it can reduce the maximum secure transmission distance to below 66.9% of its original value. By combining experimental observations with theoretical modeling, this study advances the understanding of the influence of DWDMs on the practical security of QKD systems.

Abstract: We propose an interaction-free ghost imaging scheme based on a thermal light source. By utilizing the quantum Zeno-like effect, our approach significantly reduces the light dose absorbed by the sample, thereby effectively preventing sample damage induced by light-matter interactions. Combined with the elimination of entangled photon sources and single-photon detectors, our approach enables significantly more photons to be utilized for image reconstruction, thereby markedly enhancing image quality compared to conventional ghost imaging. We further demonstrate active suppression of background noise via controllable photon loss. Our work offers a practical and cost-effective route to non-destructive, high-quality imaging for light-sensitive samples in fields such as life sciences.

Abstract: Simulating many-body fermionic systems in conventional qubit-based quantum computers poses significant challenges due to the overheads associated with the encoding of fermionic statistics in qubits, leading to the proposal of native fermionic simulators as an alternative. While allowing for fermionic problems to be simulated efficiently, this class of fermionic simulators carries also specific constraints with them and poses other challenges unfamiliar to qubit systems. Here, we propose to pair fermionic modes to form a so-called qubit in second quantisation representation. This allows fermionic gates to be represented as rotations of these second quantised qubits, enabling adaptation of methods for qubit systems. As an application, we use this pairing scheme to represent the measurement of two- and four-point correlators in fermionic simulators with its native gates as a graph problem. Optimising measurement settings is then analysed with various analytical and algorithmic methods.

Abstract: While variational quantum algorithms are among the most promising approaches for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, their scalability is often hindered by the barren plateau problem. Among the proposals that have demonstrated robustness against this issue, the ADAPT-VQE algorithm stands out for ground state estimation, primarily due to its iterative ansatz construction. Although ADAPT-VQE has been extensively benchmarked on molecular Hamiltonians, where the ground states typically exhibit low entanglement, its performance for highly entangled ground states remains largely unexplored. In this work, we explore a variant of this algorithm known as qubit-ADAPT-VQE, assessing its ability to achieve ground states with substantial entanglement in spin models. We focus on four-qubit systems and employ an algebraic entanglement classification to identify distinct entanglement classes among ground states, and consider a representative of each class as an initial state to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Our findings highlight the versatility of qubit-ADAPT-VQE, demonstrating that it accurately reaches the ground state across all entanglement classes and initial energy values.

Abstract: High-fidelity two-qubit gates have been demonstrated in systems of two fluxonium qubits; however, the realization of scalable quantum processors requires maintaining low error rates in substantially larger architectures. In this work, we analyze a system of four inductively coupled fluxonium qubits to determine the impact of spectator qubits on the performance of a \textsc{cnot} gate. Our results show that spectator-induced errors are strongly suppressed when the transition frequencies of the spectator qubits are sufficiently detuned from those of the active qubits. We identify favorable frequency configurations for the four-qubit chain that yield \textsc{cnot} gate errors below $10^{-4}$ for gate times shorter than 100 ns. Leveraging the locality of the nearest-neighbor coupling, we extrapolate our findings to longer fluxonium chains, suggesting a viable path toward scalable, low-error quantum information processing.

Abstract: Calculating the molecular ground-state energy is a central challenge in computational chemistry. Conventional methods such as the Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction scale exponentially with molecular size, limiting their applicability to large molecules. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative by mapping molecular Hamiltonians by qubits, enabling cheaper computational scaling. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to formulate molecular ground state calculations as discrete optimization problems, addressable by quantum annealing. However, these efforts have been limited by previous generations of hardware and suboptimal annealing techniques. Here, the $H_{2}O$ ground-state problem is mapped to an Ising Hamiltonian using the Xian-Bias-Kas (XBK) method. By taking advantage of enhanced qubit connectivity and shorter embedding chains, it is solved with a more than doubled probability of achieving Hartree-Fock-level solutions with respect to the most advanced predecessor. Advanced annealing strategies extend Hartree-Fock-level accuracy to significantly larger problem instances, enabling solutions that use nearly 2.5 times more physically embedded qubits than the largest cases previously reported and allowing to improve annealing results by two orders of magnitude, reaching an energy difference of 0.120~Hartree relative to Hartree-Fock. These results show tangible progress toward practical quantum annealing applications in NISQ era.

Abstract: Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory to describe microscopic phenomena. It was derived in different ways over the past 100 years by Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Feynman. At the same time, other interpretations have been suggested, including the Bohm-De Broglie interpretation and the so-called Bohmian mechanics. Here, we show that Bohmian mechanics, which utilizes the concept of the Bohm quantum potential, can also serve as a starting point for quantizing classical non-relativistic systems. By incorporating the Bohm quantum potential into the Vlasov framework, we obtain a mean-field theory that captures the corpuscular nature of matter, in agreement with quantum mechanics within the Random Phase Approximation (RPA).

Abstract: We present a room-temperature Extreme High Vacuum (XHV) system engineered to support the long-duration operation of a trapped-ion quantum processor. Background-gas collisions impose limitations on trapped-ion performance and scalability by interrupting algorithmic execution and, in some cases, ejecting ions from the trap. Using molecular-flow simulations, we optimize the chamber geometry, conductance pathways, and pumping configuration to maximize the effective pumping speed at the ion location. We perform high-temperature heat treatment of stainless steel vacuum components to achieve the desired outgassing rate, guided by quantitative relations of bulk diffusive processes, allowing us to reduce the \(\mathrm{H_2}\) outgassing load to the \(10^{-15}\,\mathrm{mbar\,l\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}\) level. The final pressure in our chamber, measured by a hot cathode gauge, is \(1.5\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{mbar}\), corresponding to the gauge's measurement limit. We measure the local pressure at the ion location by observing collision-induced reordering events in a long ion chain of mixed-isotope Yb\(^+\). From the observed reordering frequency, we extract the average interval between collisions to be \((1.9 \pm 0.1)\,\mathrm{hrs/ion}\). This corresponds to a local pressure of \((3.9 \pm 0.3)\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{mbar}\) at the ion location, assuming that all collisions arise from background H\(_2\) molecules at room temperature. Our demonstration extends the continuous operation time of a quantum processor while maintaining the simplicity of a room-temperature system that does not require cryogenic apparatus.

Abstract: Geometrically frustrated magnetism has attracted tremendous attention while chemical doping has been utilized as an important tool to probe frustrated magnetism in various systems. Here we perform a systematic study by doping non-magnetic Mg2+ into a magnetically complicated system, Co10Ge3O16, which contains three frustrated sublattices of Co2+, e.g., triangular Co1, Kagome Co2 and Co3 sublattices. By growing crystals for (Co1-xMgx)10Ge3O16 (0 < x <= 30%), we observed obvious site preference of Mg2+ on Co1 and Co3 sites over the Co2 site. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm the high purity of the samples and indicate systematic peak shift, consistent with the loading compositions. Although previously investigated, the magnetic structure and expected magnetic frustration in this system are not fully uncovered. Our temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest that the high-temperature magnetostructural phase transition with antiferromagnetic ordering and a low-temperature broad peak are suppressed with Mg2+ doping, while two new magnetic features emerge at high Mg2+ level. Moreover, the structural phase transition from high-temperature R-3m to low-temperature C2/m space group is absent at the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature, as confirmed by single-crystal XRD. By analyzing the heat capacity and neutron powder diffraction results of the highest doped sample, (Co0.7Mg0.3)10Ge3O16, we speculate that the Co1 site is responsible for the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering, while the other two sites are short-range correlated in addition to a Mg2+-induced spin-glass state. This study provides more insights into the complex magnetism in Co10Ge3O16 by using the non-magnetic Mg2+ as a probe. However, detailed magnetic structure requires further efforts on growing large single crystals.

Abstract: The functional renormalization group (fRG) is an established tool in the treatment of correlated electron systems, notably for the description of competing instabilities. In recent years, methodological advancements led to the multiloop extension of the fRG, which systematically includes loop corrections beyond the conventional one-loop truncation and yields a quantitatively accurate description of two-dimensional lattice systems. At the same time, the single-boson exchange (SBE) decomposition of the two-particle vertex has been shown to offer both computational and interpretative advantages paving the way to more affordable approximation schemes. We here apply their combination coined as multiloop SBE fRG to the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling. After providing a detailed account of the underlying formalism in physical channels, we analyze the results for the frequency- and momentum-dependent vertex functions. We find that the SBE approximation, i.e., without calculating explicitly multi-boson exchange contributions, accurately reproduces the parquet approximation at loop convergence. The presented algorithmic improvement opens the route for the treatment of more challenging parameter regimes and more realistic models.

Motivation: To understand the universal behavior of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in quantum many-body systems with conservation laws.

Method: The authors construct an effective field theory (EFT) generalizing spontaneous symmetry breaking to OTOCs, and use it to analyze late-time power-law behavior in OTOCs. Conventional transport data is also utilized.

Result: The EFT explains different power-law behaviors in OTOCs at late times and reveals that a specific combination of OTOCs is sensitive to novel transport parameters. Predictions are validated in Hamiltonian and Floquet spin chains in one dimension.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that their EFT effectively captures the late-time behavior of OTOCs in quantum many-body systems with conservation laws, and identifies novel transport parameters not visible in regular time-ordered correlators.

Abstract: We construct an effective field theory (EFT) that captures the universal behavior of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) at late times in generic quantum many-body systems with conservation laws. The EFT hinges on a generalization of the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern adapted to out-of-time-order observables, and reduces to conventional fluctuating hydrodynamics when time-ordered observables are probed. We use the EFT to explain different power-law behavior observed in OTOCs at late times, and show that many OTOCs are entirely fixed by conventional transport data. Nevertheless, we show that a specific combination of OTOCs is sensitive to novel transport parameters, not visible in regular time-ordered correlators. We test our predictions in Hamiltonian and Floquet spin chains in one dimension.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a framework that extends the notion of symmetry-protected topological properties beyond the ground-state paradigm to dynamically isolated subspaces formed by exceptional non-thermal energy eigenstates of non-integrable systems, known as quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We introduce the concept of a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) scar subspace -- a Hilbert subspace stabilized by a restricted spectrum-generating algebra (rSGA) while being protected by on-site, inversion, and time-reversal symmetries. QMBS often admit a non-interacting quasiparticle description, which enables matrix-product representations with small bond dimension. Although individual QMBS do not necessarily retain the protecting symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we show that the subspace formed by the symmetry-connected QMBS does retain them, giving rise to consistently emerging topological properties across the entire scar subspace. Using the spin-$1$ Affleck--Kennedy--Lieb--Tasaki (AKLT) model, we demonstrate that its bimagnon scar subspace reflects the topological properties of the SPT ground state, as evidenced by the appropriate bond-space symmetry representations, the expected topological response, and the numerically verified long-range string order. Our findings indicate that scar subspaces can inherit -- and in inhomogeneous cases systematically modify -- the topological character of the SPT ground state, offering a new and experimentally accessible platform for probing symmetry-protected topology beyond the ground-state regime.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide direct evidence for the nature of the deconfined quantum critical point in the $J$-$Q_3$ model, addressing previous reliance on finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy.

Method: Large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations were used to investigate the dynamical spectra of spin and bond operators, comparing the $J$-$Q_3$ model with the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model.

Result: In the $J$-$Q_3$ model, four gapless transverse modes were observed at either side of the transition, supporting the weakly first-order scenario with emergent $SO(5)$ symmetry breaking to $O(4)$. This contrasts with the $O(3)$ symmetry restoration in the $J_1$-$J_2$ model.

Conclusion: The study provides direct evidence for the weakly first-order scenario at the deconfined quantum critical point in the $J$-$Q_3$ model, showing an emergent $SO(5)$ symmetry that spontaneously breaks to $O(4)$. This contrasts with the $O(3)$ symmetry restoration observed in the $J_1$-$J_2$ model.

Abstract: Recent numerical and theoretical studies on the two-dimensional $J$-$Q_3$ model suggests that the deconfined quantum critical point is actually a $SO(5)$-symmetry-enhanced first-order phase transition that is spontaneously broken to $O(4)$. However, this conclusion has mainly relied on finite-size scaling of the entanglement entropy, lacking direct evidence from physical observables.} Here, we investigate the dynamical spectra of spin and bond operators at the deconfined critical point of the $J$-$Q_3$ model using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and contrasting them with the well-established $\mathrm{O(3)}$ Wilson-Fisher criticality in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model. Although both models exhibit two gapless magnon modes in the Néel phase, their critical behaviors diverge strikingly. At the $J_1$-$J_2$ critical point, the Higgs mode becomes gapless, yielding three gapless modes that reflect the full restoration of the $\mathrm{O(3)}$ symmetry. {In the $J$-$Q_3$ model, we instead observe four gapless transverse modes at the either side of the transition. This spectral feature, together with the entanglement entropy results, provides direct evidence for the weakly first-order scenario that the deconfined quantum critical point exhibits an emergent $\mathrm{SO(5)}$ symmetry that spontaneously breaks to $\mathrm{O(4)}$.

Motivation: To understand the intertwined electronic orders and symmetry-breaking phenomena in quantum materials, specifically the exotic charge density wave (CDW) order in kagome superconductors like CsV3Sb5.

Method: The researchers utilized angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tunable magnetic field (magneto-ARPES) to study the electronic structure of CsV3Sb5 under external magnetic fields.

Result: The study revealed momentum-selective responses to magnetic fields: vanadium d-orbital bands showed C6 rotational symmetry breaking and field-dependent spectral broadening, while antimony p-orbital bands exhibited persistent elongation above the CDW transition.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of magneto-ARPES as a tool for disentangling intertwined electronic orders in quantum materials, providing insights into the distinct behaviors of vanadium and antimony orbitals under magnetic fields.

Abstract: In quantum materials with multiple degrees of freedom with similar energy scales, intertwined electronic orders with distinct broken symmetries often appear in a strongly coupled fashion. Recently, in a class of kagome superconductors represented by CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, experimental reports have suggested rotational symmetry breaking and time reversal symmetry breaking associated with a charge density wave (CDW) order, revealing an exotic nature of this CDW order. Here, utilizing our recently developed capability of performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a tunable magnetic field (magneto-ARPES), we reveal momentum-selective response of the electronic structure of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ to an external magnetic field. While the response in the electronic structure is clearly compatible with piezomagnetism, strong orbital-selectivity is observed. Specifically, bands associated with the vanadium $d$-orbitals contributing to the Van Hove singularities (VHS) near the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary exhibit selective spectral broadening that breaks C$_6$ rotational symmetry and is odd in magnetic field, disappearing above the CDW transition. Meanwhile, the antimony $p$-orbital dominated electron pocket at the BZ center becomes elongated under an applied field -- an effect that persists above the $T_{\rm CDW}$. Our observations delineate the origin of the time-reversal symmetry breaking associated with the vanadium VHS-bands at the onset of the CDW order, while the field-induced rotational symmetry breaking largely associated with the antimony $p$ orbitals reflects fluctuations beyond the CDW ordering temperature. Our magneto-ARPES work demonstrates a novel tuning knob for disentangling intertwined orders in the momentum space for quantum materials.

Conclusion: 分析了全局时间迭代方法在求解Kadanoff-Baym方程中的优缺点，并指出了使其与时步方法竞争的关键挑战。

Abstract: Although the Kadanoff-Baym equations are typically solved using time-stepping methods, iterative global-in-time solvers offer potential algorithmic advantages, particularly when combined with compressed representations of two-time objects. We examine the computational complexity and stability of several global-in-time iterative methods, including multiple variants of fixed point iteration, Jacobian-free methods, and a Newton-Krylov method using automatic differentiation. We consider the ramped and periodically-driven Falicov-Kimball and Hubbard models within time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory. Although we observe that several iterative methods yield stable convergence at large propagation times, a standard forward fixed point iteration does not. We find that the number of iterations required to converge to a given accuracy with a fixed time step size scales roughly linearly with the number of time steps. This scaling is associated with the formation of a propagating front in the residual error, whose velocity is method-dependent. We identify key challenges which must be addressed in order to make global solvers competitive with time-stepping methods.

Abstract: Chirality, referring to the absence of mirror and inversion symmetries, is a ubiquitous concept in nature. In condensed matter physics, vigorous research has clarified how chiral materials harbour unconventional electronic and vibrational responses. In parallel, recent studies have demonstrated that chiral structures can be engineered or tuned from achiral precursors. Despite these complementary advances, an integrated understanding of electronic and phononic dynamics, self-organized chiral structures, and their interplay is still lacking. Such an integrated framework is crucial both for elucidating the spontaneous formation and stabilization of chiral structures and for advancing the electronic functionalities of chiral materials. Here, we predict novel spontaneous structural phase transitions unique to chiral crystals with screw symmetry. In quasi-one-dimensional chiral crystals, the phonon frequency renormalized by the electron-phonon coupling depends on the handedness of circular polarization. Consequently, the soft mode encoding the intrinsic phonon angular momentum induces spin-selective Peierls gaps in the electronic band, entailing a helical spin density wave and chiral lattice distortion. We also elucidate the chiral signature of collective modes. Our findings offer new avenues for advanced spintronics applications and crucial insights into the elusive mechanisms underlying the formation process of chirality in nature.

Abstract: We argue that the low-temperature physics of $S=1$ pyrochlore magnets with a predominantly Ising-like easy-axis exchange coupling $J$ that favors the local tetrahedral body diagonals, and a comparably large easy-plane single-ion anisotropy $Δ=J + μ$ ($|μ| \ll J$) that favors the plane perpendicular to these local axes will exhibit interesting new phenomena due to the competition between $J$ and $Δ$. In the $T/J \rightarrow 0$ limit, we find three low temperature phases as a function of $μ/T$: a short-range correlated paramagnetic phase, and two topologically-distinct Coulomb liquids separated by a $Z_2$ flux confinement transition. Both Coulomb liquids are described at long-wavelengths by a fluctuating divergence-free polarization field and have characteristic pinch-point singularities in their structure factor. In one Coulomb phase, the flux of this polarization field is confined to {\em even} integers, while it takes on all integer values in the other Coulomb phase. Experimental realizations with $|μ| \ll J$ and negative are predicted to exhibit signatures of a transition from a flux-deconfined Coulomb phase to the flux-confined Coulomb phase as they are cooled below $T_{c_2} \approx 1.57|μ|$, while realizations with positive $μ\ll J$ will show signatures of a transition from a flux-deconfined Coulomb liquid to a short-range correlated paramagnet via a continuous $XY$-like transition at $T_{c_1} \approx 0.98 μ$.

Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling is believed to be responsible for many spectral anomalies in the cuprate superconductors. In particular, the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode of the oxygen ion in the $CuO_{2}$ plane has been proposed to be responsible for the dramatic peak-dip-hump(PDH) structure in the anti-nodal spectrum. The recent observation of the exceptional flat quasiparticle dispersion in the anti-nodal region and the sudden suppression of the PDH structure around the pseudogap end point cast doubts on such a scenario. Instead, a scenario involving the coupling to the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation seems to resolve both puzzles naturally. Here we present a systematic study on the interplay between antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation and electron-phonon coupling in the cuprate superconductors. We show that the coupling strength to the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode is strongly suppressed by the vertex correction caused by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation in the $\mathbf{q}\rightarrow 0$ limit as a result of the destructive interference between electron-phonon coupling at electron momentum differ by the antiferromagnetic wave vector. Counterintuitively, we find that the same vertex correction enhances the phonon contribution to the PDH structure. We also find that while the coupling to either the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation or the $B_{1g}$ buckling mode can generate a PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum with similar phenomenologies, the sudden suppression of such a structure around the pseudogap end point should be mainly attributed to the dramatic change in the nature of the spin fluctuation at such a critical doping. We suggest to take the PDH structure in the anti-nodal spectrum as a spectral signature for the emergence of fluctuating local moment in the pseudogap phase and the entrance of a doped Mott insulating state.

Method: Phase purity was confirmed via powder X-ray diffraction. Magnetic susceptibility and specific-heat measurements were conducted to analyze magnetic properties. Ab initio quantum chemical calculations were used to understand the magnetic behavior differences.

Result: TlErSe₂ shows long-range magnetic order below 0.42 K, while TlTmSe₂ does not. The magnetic behaviors of both compounds are analyzed and compared, supported by experimental data and calculations.

The phase diagram for TlErSe₂ is mapped out, and ab initio calculations provide insights into these differences.

Abstract: Delafossite compounds containing rare-earth ions have been proven to be an ideal platform to investigate frustrated magnetic ground states. Here, we discuss two triangular-lattice antiferromagnets, TlErSe$_2$ and TlTmSe$_2$, as potential candidates for hosting exotic quantum states. Powder X-ray diffraction data analysis of the black-color polycrystalline Tl$RE$Se$_2$ ($RE$: Er and Tm) samples confirms the phase purity. Both materials crystallize in the trigonal $α$-NaFeO$_2$ structure ($R\overline{3}m$) with lattice parameters $a$ = 4.1070(4) Å and $c$ = 23.1472(1) Å for the erbium compound and $a$ = 4.0916(1) Å and $c$ = 23.1483(2) Å for the thulium compound. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show an effective moment of $μ_{\text{eff}} = 9.6(2) μ_B$/f.u. ($7.5(1) μ_B$/f.u.) for TlErSe$_2$ (TlTmSe$_2$) for temperatures above 200 K. While $^3$He specific-heat measurements reveal long-range magnetic order below $T_N = 0.42 $K for TlErSe$_2$, no sign of long-range magnetic order was observed for TlTmSe$_2$. Based on our results, we map out the T-H phase diagram for polycrystalline TlErSe$_2$ and discuss the striking difference in the magnetic behavior of TlTmSe$_2$ based on our ab initio quantum chemical calculations.

Abstract: Curvilinear magnetic nanostructures enable control of magnetization dynamics through geometry-induced anisotropy and chiral interactions as well as magnetic field modulation. In this work, we report a curvilinear magnonic crystal based on large-area square arrays of truncated nanospikes fabricated by conformal coating of 3D hierarchical templates with permalloy thin films. Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy reveals anisotropic band structure with multiple dispersive and folded Bloch-type dispersive spin-wave modes as well as non-dispersive modes exhibiting direction-dependent frequency shifts and intensity asymmetries along lattice principal axes. Finite element micromagnetic simulations indicate that curvature-induced variations of the demagnetizing field govern the magnonic response, enabling the identification of modes propagating in nanochannels and other localized on nanospike apexes or along the ridges connecting adjacent nanospikes. The combination of geometric curvature and optical probing asymmetry produces directional dependence of magnonic bands, establishing 3D hierarchical templates as a versatile platform for curvature-engineered magnonics.

Abstract: Kagome lattice antiferromagnets exhibit plethora of intriguing phases of matter. Particularly interesting state appears at the magnetic field-induced $1/9$ magnetization plateau observed in several recent experimental studies. The nature and exotic physical properties of the plateau however remain controversial due to an exceptional complexity of the state generated by geometrical frustration. Among candidate states recent studies found a $Z_3$ quantum spin liquid state, a valence bond crystal exhibiting an hourglass pattern and a valence bond crystal state with a $3\times 3$ periodicity and a windmill-shaped motif. Recent torque magnetometry measurements on YCOB single-crystal samples however indicate presence of Dirac-like spinons at $1/9$ magnetization plateau. We study properties of the plateau state using novel machine learning technique that combines variational Monte Carlo, symmetry enhanced neural network quantum states and flux insertion method. Our machine learning study reveals that the ground state at the $1/9$ plateau is a gapless $1\times 1$ chiral spin density wave caused by 2$k_F$ instability of the underlying composite Fermi liquid. The spin wave chirality results from the correlated spin order that reflects its nontrivial topology.

Abstract: Sandpile models are known to resist exact results. In this direction, space-time correlations between avalanches have proven to be especially difficult to access. One of the main obstacle to do so comes from taking memory effects in a systematic way along the computation. In this paper, we partially fill this gap and derive recursive relations for the particle filling and avalanche 2-points correlation function in the 1D Directed Stochastic Sandpile. These expressions allow to characterize the sign of the correlations and estimates are provided in the particle filling case. In fact, density correlations are shown to be positively correlated. This behavior is directly related to persistence of the local particle filling. On the other hand, we show that avalanches are anticorrelated in the model. This is interpreted by the fact that avalanches disrupt the system and the damage can only be fully compensated after injecting a sufficiently high number of particles. These results indicate an underlying trade off, between static and dynamic observable, for the system to sit in its stationary state. It appears that this balance is controlled by the conservation of the particle number along the avalanches.

Abstract: We show that nonequilibrium dynamics can play a constructive role in unsupervised machine learning by inducing the spontaneous emergence of latent-state cycles. We introduce a model in which visible and hidden variables interact through two independently parametrized transition matrices, defining a Markov chain whose steady state is intrinsically out of equilibrium. Likelihood maximization drives this system toward nonequilibrium steady states with finite entropy production, reduced self-transition probabilities, and persistent probability currents in the latent space. These cycles are not imposed by the architecture but arise from training, and models that develop them avoid the low-log-likelihood regime associated with nearly reversible dynamics while more faithfully reproducing the empirical distribution of data classes. Compared with equilibrium approaches such as restricted Boltzmann machines, our model breaks the detailed balance between the forward and backward conditional transitions and relies on a log-likelihood gradient that depends explicitly on the last two steps of the Markov chain. Hence, this exploration of the interface between nonequilibrium statistical physics and modern machine learning suggests that introducing irreversibility into latent-variable models can enhance generative performance.

Abstract: Recently, a combinatorial approach to discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has been progressively developed. In this work, we review its achievements up to the present moment, focusing on the practical aspects and discussing its limitations. First, we present the assumptions and combinatorial foundations of the approach, which are based on direct counting of the system states, in contrast to the previous approaches of Smoluchowski and Marcus--Lushnikov. A method to obtain combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and the corresponding standard deviation is described by solving the simplest example of a constant kernel. Then, we extend consideration to a number of kernels (e.g., additive, product, linear--chain, condensation), which were recently solved by explicitly finding the number of internal states of the cluster of a given size. Next, we show that theoretical predictions for any given kernel may be obtained with no need to find an explicit solution but using a recursive expression. We exploit this opportunity to present the use of combinatorial expressions to solve kernels related to the real processes of aerosol growth and planetesimal formation. At this point, a comparison to numerical results appears. Other potential application fields are indicated, including dust agglomeration and polymer growth. Finally, issues related to the varying precision of the theoretical predictions are summarized. In the last section, we propose open problems.

Abstract: We develop a fluctuation framework to quantify the free energy difference between two equilibrium states connected by nonequilibrium processes under arbitrary dynamics and system-environment coupling. For an open system described by the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF), we show that the equilibrium free energy difference between two canonical endpoints can be written as exponential averages of the HMF shift, divided by an explicit factor built from the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final system marginals. These relations hold at the endpoint level and, under an asymptotic equilibration postulate, admit trajectory representations for general driving and coupling protocols. A decomposition of the HMF increment along each trajectory separates the work-like contributions associated with changes in $λ(t)$ and $C(t)$, the heat-like exchange with the environment, and a feedback-like functional defined with respect to the initial protocol. In the frozen-driving regime with a noninteracting reference, the equalities reduce to new FEP-like expressions involving an environment functional and an explicit overlap correction, with the Zwanzig formula recovered as a limiting case. We validate the approach on an open system coupled to an environment and evolved under overdamped Langevin dynamics, where conventional Zwanzig FEP suffers from poor phase-space overlap and slow numerical convergence, while the present trajectory equality closely matches the exact free energy difference over a broad range of coupling strengths.

Abstract: Single-particle heat engines at atomic and colloidal scales obey the universal thermodynamic bounds on work and efficiency. Here, we translate these principles to the macroscale by building an athermal Stirling engine whose working medium is a millimeter-sized, vibrofluidized granule confined in a time-dependent magnetic trap. By embedding a rattler within the granule to inject noise, we engineer overdamped, Brownian-like dynamics in an otherwise inertial particle. This design enables independent control over the granule's effective temperature and spatial confinement. Our engine quantitatively reproduces the universal power-efficiency trade-offs of finite-time thermodynamics, achieving the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency at maximum power. Strikingly, we uncover a control parameter-dependent damping that leads to an unexpected dissipation mechanism - the losses in the compression stroke rival or even exceed those during expansion. Our work establishes an accessible experimental platform to study small-system thermodynamics in intrinsically athermal systems.

Abstract: We propose a variant of Andreev spin qubits (ASQs) defined in planar Josephson junctions based on spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in a weak out-of-plane magnetic field. The magnetic field induces a linear phase gradient across the junction, generating Josephson vortices that can host low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs). We show that, in certain parameter regimes, the combined effect of the phase gradient and spin-orbit coupling stabilizes an odd-fermion parity ground state, where a single Josephson vortex binds a spinful low-energy degree of freedom that is energetically separated from the other ABSs. This low-energy degree of freedom can be exploited to define a special type of ASQ, which we dub the vortex spin qubit (VSQ). We show that single-qubit gates for VSQs can be performed via flux driving, while readout can be achieved by adapting standard circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques developed for conventional ASQs. We further outline how an entangling two-qubit gate can be performed using an ac current drive. We argue that VSQs offer prospects for a substantial reduction in device complexity and hardware overhead compared to conventional ASQ implementations, while preserving key advantages such as supercurrent-based readout, single-qubit gates, and long-range two-qubit gates.

Abstract: Fractionalization in ideal Chern bands and non-Hermitian topological physics are two active but so far separate research directions. Merging these, we generalize the notion of ideal Chern bands to the non-Hermitian realm and uncover several striking consequences both on the level of band theory and in the strongly interacting regime. Specifically, we show that the lowest band of a Kapit--Mueller lattice model with an imaginary gauge potential satisfies a generalized ideal condition with complex Berry curvature in sync with a complex quantum metric. The ideal band remains purely real and exactly flat yet all right and left eigenstates accumulate at the boundaries on a cylinder, implying a non-Hermitian skin effect without an accompanying spectral winding. The skin effect is inherited by the many-body zero modes, yielding skin-Laughlin states with an exponential profile on the lattice. Moreover, at a critical strength of non-Hermiticity there is an unconventional phase transition on the torus, which is absent on the cylinder. Our findings lead to an extension of topological order in non-Hermitian systems.

Abstract: Two-dimensional moiré materials offer a powerful, twist-tunable platform for engineering electronic bands and correlations, though most studies to date have focused on small twist angles where flat bands arise from symmetry-pinned monolayer momenta. Here, we observe the surprising emergence of flat electronic bands with a distinctive quasi-one-dimensional dispersion at large twist angles in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides that originate from the $Λ$ valley states at generic momenta between $Γ$ and $K$ points. These taco-shaped anisotropic bands result from optimal interlayer hybridization between like-spin $Λ$ valleys at the conduction band minimum in the Brillouin zone, resulting in directional band flattening at a magic twist-angle of 21.8$^{\circ}$. The bands form six anisotropic channels with a sixfold alternating spin texture reminiscent of altermagnetic textures. At low energies, the density of states shows a power-law dependence due to the quasi-one-dimensional character, enhancing the potential for correlated phases. Our results provide a new platform for correlated phenomena and broaden the scope of moiré engineering to large twist angles in 2D materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the nonlinear response of a 2D electronic system under an external magnetic field and incident electromagnetic wave, focusing on magnetoplasmon excitation and resulting DC current and photovoltage.

Method: The study uses Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic waves and hydrodynamic approximation (Euler's equations) for electron dynamics, neglecting electromagnetic retardation effects.

Result: The incident electromagnetic wave excites magnetoplasmons, leading to a DC current along the strip and a photovoltage across it. The photocurrent-photovoltage relationship in resonance matches the classical Hall effect. The photocurrent shows a minimum at specific wavevector directions.

Conclusion: The theoretical investigation reveals that the nonlinear response of the 2D electronic system to a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave results in a DC current and photovoltage, with a surprising similarity to the classical Hall effect in resonance conditions. The photocurrent exhibits a minimum at specific wavevector directions.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate a nonlinear response to a linearly polarized monochromatic electromagnetic wave incident at an angle on a two-dimensional (2D) electronic system (ES) in the form of an infinite strip. The 2D ES is situated on a dielectric substrate near a perfectly conducting metal electrode (gate). The entire system is subjected to an external perpendicular constant magnetic field. We use Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic waves, while the electrons are described within the hydrodynamic approximation using Euler's equations and neglecting electromagnetic retardation effects. The incident electromagnetic wave excites magnetoplasmons in the strip. The fully screened limit is considered when all characteristic dimensions of the system, including the plasmon wavelengths, are much larger than the distance to the gate. This limit allows the linear response to be determined fully analytically. Due to the nonlinear hydrodynamic (convective) term, the excited magnetoplasmon oscillations give rise to a DC current along the strip and a voltage across it. Surprisingly, the relationship between the photocurrent and the photovoltage in resonance is exactly the same as in the classical Hall effect. The photovoltage is a monotonic function of the magnetic field. However, the photocurrent exhibits a minimum, which occurs at specific wavevector directions.

Abstract: A range of twist angles between adjacent surfaces/volumes are intrinsic to natural graphite or artificially design in multi-layer graphene. In addition, stacking faults can be created by the application of mechanic, electric or magnetic fields. Charge and spin transport then occur in relation to the existing twist-angle pattern. In two dimensions, a saddle point in the electronic band structure leads to divergence in the density of states, known as van Hove singularities (vHs). The energy difference between vHs for the conduction and valence bands was found to increase with the twist angle between neighboring graphite domains with respect to the c axis (perpendicular to the graphite planes). In this work, we estimate for the superconducting (SC)-like nano-size multi-layer granular domain in hydrogenated graphitic fibers [1]. We show that this value for and the values found by others for few-layer graphene might actually form the Fibonacci mathematical sequence. Moreover, SC hydrogenated graphite can harbour higher-order topology as reflected in at least quadratic energy gap flattening. Charge transport and magnetization measurements on hydrogenated graphitic fibers have been done using a Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System.

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the angle dependence of magnetization $M(α)$ for single crystals of CrSb. CrSb belongs to a new class of altermagnetic materials, the small net magnetization is accompanied by alternating spin splitting in the k-space. In addition, CrSb reveals also topological features with Weyl surface states originating from bulk band topology. We observe, that $M(α)$ oscillates around zero value, so magnetization is positive for $M(α)$ maxima and it is negative for $M(α)$ minima. The magnetization reversal curves $M(H)$ are non-linear with low-field hysteresis, but with almost linear high-field branches. The slope of the linear branches well correlates with $M(α)$ oscillations, so it is positive for $M(α)$ maxima and negative for $M(α)$ minima. We demonstrate, that the interplay between the positive and the negative $M(H)$ slopes originates from several magnetic phases in CrSb. In particular, current-carrying topological surface states are responsible for the diamagnetic-like $M(H)$ negative slope, which dominates for the directions of full spin compensation in the bulk CrSb altermagnetic spectrum. Due to the spin-momentum locking, topological surface states are spin-polarized, which is responsible for the low-field hysteresis. Thus, we experimentally demonstrate both the altermagnetic bulk and the topological surface magnetizations for the altermagnetic candidate CrSb.

Abstract: We consider a wire consisting of a conducting ferromagnetic layer and an insulating antiferromagnetic layer that are coupled. The ferromagnet hosts a domain wall, which is dynamically driven by a charge current. We show that for a specific time-dependent current, the domain wall moves according to a Rindler trajectory. This motion excites spin waves in the antiferromagnetic insulator, and their emission spectrum is characterised by an effective temperature analogous to the Unruh temperature, $T_U = \hbar a/2πc k_B$, with a the acceleration of the domain wall, c the maximum antiferromagnetic spin wave velocity, and kB the Boltzmann constant. This thermal signature is a direct consequence of the Unruh effect and could be experimentally observed. Our results establish magnetism as a promising platform for probing relativistic quantum field phenomena. Moreover, since the Unruh effect is inherently linked to entanglement, our proposal provides a route for entangling magnetic domain walls via relativistic effects.

Motivation: To explore the dynamics of nonlinear Thouless pumps in the presence of disorder and understand how nonlinearity affects quantization and adiabaticity.

Method: Investigation of nonlinear optical Thouless pumps using optical waveguide arrays, focusing on soliton displacement under disorder.

Result: Quantization persists in disordered nonlinear pumps, unlike in the linear domain, and nonlinearity allows for faster pump cycles.

Conclusion: Nonlinearity enables the maintenance of quantization in disordered Thouless pumps, offering a design principle for faster, non-reciprocal integrated devices.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of nonlinear optical Thouless pumps in the presence of disorder, using optical waveguide arrays. It was previously known that the displacement of solitons in Thouless pumps is quantized and may exhibit integer and fractional transport over the course of the pump cycle. Here, we demonstrate that, in disordered nonlinear pumps, quantization may be maintained despite the presence of disorder, even though it would not be in the linear domain. Moreover, nonlinearity allows pumps to be executed more quickly (i.e., less adiabatically). This may serve as a design principle for integrated non-reciprocal devices based on temporal modulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing classical and quantum methods fail to describe nonlinear magnetism at ultrashort scales, either breaking down due to quantum correlations or being limited to near-equilibrium conditions.

Method: Development of a semiclassical theory where spin correlations serve as dynamical variables, preserving the su(2) spin algebra and capturing nonclassical nonlinear dynamics.

Result: The theory predicts nonlinear scaling of quantum oscillations in Heisenberg antiferromagnets, confirmed by exact diagonalization, with dynamics embedded in the geometric phase space of spin correlations.

Conclusion: The semiclassical theory of spin correlations provides a foundation for exploring nonlinear quantum magnetism, offering a transparent geometric understanding of nonclassical dynamics and accommodating phenomenological damping.

Abstract: Classical nonlinear theories are highly successful in describing far-from-equilibrium dynamics of magnets, encompassing phenomena such as parametric resonance, ultrafast switching, and even chaos. However, at ultrashort length and time scales, where quantum correlations become significant, these models inevitably break down. While numerous methods exist to simulate quantum many-body spin systems, they are often limited to near-equilibrium conditions, capture only short-time dynamics, or obscure the intuitive connection between nonlinear behavior and its geometric origin in the su(2) spin algebra. To advance nonlinear magnetism into the quantum regime, we develop a theory in which semiclassical spin correlations, rather than individual spins, serve as the fundamental dynamical variables. Defined on the bonds of a bipartite lattice, these correlations are inherently nonlocal, with dynamics following through a semiclassical mapping that preserves the original spin algebra. The resulting semiclassical theory captures nonlinear dynamics that are entirely nonclassical and naturally accommodates phenomenological damping at the level of correlations, which is typically challenging to include in quantum methods. As an application, we focus on Heisenberg antiferromagnets, which feature significant quantum effects. We predict nonlinear scaling of the mean frequency of quantum oscillations in the Néel state with the spin quantum number S. These have no classical analog and exhibit features reminiscent of nonlinear parametric resonance, fully confirmed by exact diagonalization. The predicted dynamical features are embedded in the geometric structure of the semiclassical phase space of spin correlations, making their physical origin much more transparent than in full quantum methods. With this, semiclassical spin-correlation dynamics provide a foundation for exploring nonlinear quantum magnetism.

Abstract: High performance devices consisting of interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) on top of single-layer graphene (SLG) are candidates with favorable prospects for sensing applications. Graphene micro ribbons (GMRs) of various widths and IDE design geometries were fabricated and experimentally examined regarding their low-frequency noise (LFN) behavior. Measurements revealed a 1/f behavior and different kinds of trap activity behind it, which were studied through the analysis of random telegraph noise (RTN) signals. Our investigation suggests that adjusting the geometrical characteristics of either the GMR width or the IDE topology can significantly influence the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of SLG-based electronics. On the bright side, the results of our study can provide useful guidelines for fabrication decisions to maximize the SNR.

Abstract: Structured optical fields can be used for the injection and control of charge and spin-valley currents. Here, we present a systematical study of these phenomena for interband absorption of structured light in 2D Dirac materials. We derive general expressions for the current density and the quasi-classical generation rate of photoelectrons in the momentum, coordinate, and spin-valley spaces. We reveal mechanisms of the current formation determined by the local and non-local contributions to the optical generation, including the mechanisms related to optical alignment of electron momenta by linearly polarized light, optical orientation by circularly polarized light, and the class of charge and spin-valley photon drags sensitive to the phase and polarization profiles of the optical field. We develop a kinetic theory of electric and spin-valley currents driven by the optical field with spatially inhomogeneous intensity, polarization, and phase and obtain analytical expressions for the current contributions. The theory is applied to analyze the photocurrents emerging in TMDC layers and graphene excited by polarization gratings.

Abstract: Quantum self-oscillatory phases are ubiquitous in driven-dissipative systems. Classically, each phase is defined by its flow pattern and how stationary sets organize phase space (e.g. fixed points and limit cycles), with transitions triggered by local bifurcations or global basin rearrangements. In the quantum regime, these reorganizations are often blurred by density-matrix averaging, and spectral indicators such as the Liouvillian gap can miss changes that unfold mainly in the transients. Here we introduce a topological graph invariant, the molecule, which captures the phase-space connectivity of fixed points and limit cycles. Transitions show up as discrete changes of this invariant, with each form marking a distinct quantum dynamical pattern (e.g. relaxation pathway). The molecule encodes the global topological constraints that govern how stationary sets and their basins can rearrange, clarifies when such rearrangements can affect the Liouvillian modes, and reveals additional transitions that remain hidden in the steady-state spectrum but stem from global changes of the flow topology. Our findings show that flow topology offers a clear and unified way to identify and classify dynamical phases beyond what Liouvillian spectra alone reveal.
