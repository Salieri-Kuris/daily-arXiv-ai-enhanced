In this work, we reveal\nthat the crystallization of the topological-ordered liquid proceeds in a\nfundamentally different way. The topological-ordered phase is characterized by\na global conserved quantity and its conjugate fractional charge, which we call\na flux and a triplet in our working system of the charge Ising model on a\ntriangular lattice. In contrast to the normal crystallization process, the\nphase transition is driven by the diffusive motion of triplets, which is\nrequired to change the value of conserved fluxes to exit the\ntopological-ordered phase. In order to complete crystallization, triplets must\nspend a divergently long time to diffuse over a macroscopic distance across the\nsystem, which results in glassy behavior. Reflecting the diffusive motion of\ntriplets, the initial crystallization process shows slowing down with unusually\nsmall Avrami exponent $\\sim0.5$.

Such single-photon\nswitching devices can be integrated into reconfigurable photonic circuits to\nactively control the photon propagation direction in a quantum network.\nIdeally, a single-photon switch should be fast, efficient, scalable, compatible\nwith existing technology, and should preserve the routed photon states with\nhigh fidelity. In this review, we focus on theoretical proposals and\nexperimental demonstrations of single-photon switches based on quantum emitters\ncoupled to solid-state nanostructures, including waveguide and cavity\narchitectures. We also present the theoretical methods that are commonly used\nto model single-photon scattering in waveguide-based systems by applying them\nto the elementary system of a two-level emitter coupled to a waveguide. This\nreview brings together key theoretical techniques from quantum optics, their\napplications to controllable single-photon transport, and the experimental\nrealization of single-photon switching devices across different physical\nplatforms, including semiconductor quantum dots, neutral atoms, superconducting\nqubits, and color centers.", "AI": {"tldr": "A review of single-photon switches using quantum emitters in nanophotonic structures, covering theory, experiments, and applications in quantum networks.", "motivation": "To advance the development of single-photon switches for quantum networks by exploring tunable light-matter interactions and photonic circuit integration.", "method": "The paper reviews theoretical methods for modeling single-photon scattering in waveguide systems and experimental demonstrations using various quantum emitters (e.g., quantum dots, neutral atoms, superconducting qubits).", "result": "The review summarizes key theoretical techniques and experimental progress in single-photon switching, demonstrating compatibility with diverse quantum emitter platforms.", "conclusion": "The review highlights the potential of quantum emitters coupled to nanophotonic structures for realizing efficient, scalable, and high-fidelity single-photon switches, integrating theoretical and experimental advancements across multiple platforms."}}
