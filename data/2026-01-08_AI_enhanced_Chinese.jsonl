By replacing conventional momenta with Dunkl momenta and allowing arbitrary time dependence in both, mass and frequency, we derive a deformed Pauli Hamiltonian that encodes reflection symmetries and topological gauge phases. Employing the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method, we derive exact expressions for the eigenvalues and spinor eigenfunctions of the system. Crucially, the AB flux imposes symmetry constraints on the Dunkl parameters of the form $\u03bd_1 = \\mp \u03bd_2 $, linking the reflection symmetry ($\u03b5= \\pm 1 $) to the quantization of angular momentum. These constraints modify the energy spectrum and wavefunctions of the angular operator and the invariant operator.

Here, we analyze the dynamics of Meissner currents and Abrikosov vortices in a superconducting nanocube exposed to combined static and microwave magnetic fields, extending the analysis to a more general excitation geometry. We demonstrate that, in a noncollinear configuration,the magnetization component parallel to the static field develops a dominant second-harmonic response under the microwave driving. This effect is strongly enhanced when Meissner currents saturate at static fields just below the thresholds for successive vortex nucleation. By numerically solving the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, we show that the response originates from Meissner-current saturation combined with the nonlinear oscillations of normal-phase indentations, yielding an anisotropic second-harmonic signal that is directionally separated from, and not overshadowed by, the first-harmonic component of the dynamic magnetization.

Contrary to conventional wisdom -- which assumes that weak interlayer bonding and large layer separation suppress electronic coupling to these modes -- we show that the associated charge transfer can generate a substantial pairing interaction. We develop a theory of superconductivity mediated by such interlayer modes and demonstrate that proximity to a ferroelectric or antiferroelectric quantum critical point provides a strong-coupling pairing channel. Within a two-dimensional model with SU(2) symmetry and in-plane isotropy, we find an accidental degeneracy between interlayer triplet states, which can occur even for an $s$-wave in-plane gap. We further show that Josephson coupling between layers, arising from either static magnetism or induced by paramagnetic correlations, can stabilize a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting state of the $s+i\\,s$ type, which couples to magnetization when at least two mirror symmetries are absent.

The effect of squeezing depends critically on the system's symmetry and parameters. When the squeezing operator breaks particle-hole symmetry (PHS), DQPTs become highly tunable, allowing one to either induce transitions within a single phase or suppress them. Remarkably, when PHS is preserved and the squeezing strength reaches $r=\u03c0/4$, a universal class of DQPTs emerges, independent of the quench path. This universality is characterized by two key features: (i) the collapse of all Fisher zeros onto the real-time axis, and (ii) the saturation of intermode entanglement to its maximum in each $(k,-k)$ modes. Moreover, the critical momenta governing the DQPTs coincide exactly with the modes attaining the maximal entanglement. At this universal point, the dynamical phase vanishes, leading to a purely geometric evolution marked by $\u03c0$-jumps in the Pancharatnam geometric phase.

An approach to alleviating these demands is provided by adaptive measurement strategies, which can yield up to a quadratic improvement in reconstruction accuracy for pure states by dynamically optimizing measurement settings during data acquisition. A key open question is whether these asymptotic advantages remain in realistic experiments, where readout is inevitably noisy. In this work, we analyze the impact of readout noise on adaptive quantum state tomography with readout-error mitigation, focusing on the challenging regime of reconstructing pure states using mixed-state estimators. Using analytical arguments based on Fisher information optimization and extensive numerical simulations using Bayesian inference, we show that any nonzero readout noise eliminates the asymptotic quadratic scaling advantage of adaptive strategies. We numerically investigate the behavior for finite measurement statistics for single- and two-qubit systems with exact readout-error mitigation and find a gradual transition from ideal to sub-optimal scaling. We furthermore investigate realistic scenarios where detector tomography is performed with a limited number of state copies for calibration, showing that insufficient detector characterization leads to estimator bias and limited reconstruction accuracy. Although our result imposes an upper bound on the reconstruction accuracy that can be achieved with adaptive strategies, we nevertheless observe numerically a constant-factor gain in reconstruction accuracy, which becomes larger as the readout noise decreases. This indicates potential practical benefits in using adaptive measurement strategies in well-calibrated experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity.

First, they enable probing a sample at a chosen wavelength while detecting light at a different wavelength with high efficiency (bicolor quantum imaging and sensing with undetected light). Second, they can show quantum-enhanced sensitivities below the shot-noise limit, potentially reaching Heisenberg-limited precision in parameter estimation. Here, we compare three quantum-imaging configurations using only easily accessible intensity-based measurements for phase estimation: a Yurke-type SU(1,1) interferometer, a Mandel-type induced-coherence interferometer, and a hybrid scheme that continuously interpolates between them. While an ideal Yurke interferometer can exhibit Heisenberg scaling, this advantage is known to be fragile under realistic detection constraints and in the presence of loss. We demonstrate that differential intensity detection in the Mandel interferometer provides the highest and most robust phase sensitivity among the considered schemes, reaching but not surpassing the shot-noise limit, even in the presence of loss. Intensity measurements in a Yurke-type configuration can achieve genuine sub-shot-noise sensitivity under balanced losses and moderate gain; however, their performance degrades in realistic high-gain regimes. Consequently, in this regime, the Mandel configuration with differential detection outperforms the Yurke-type setup and constitutes the most robust approach for phase estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
