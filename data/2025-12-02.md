### [1] [Quantum Optimality in the Odd-Cycle game: the topological odd-blocker, marked connected components of the giant, consistency of pearls, vanishing homotopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21774)

Conclusion: 通过引入拓扑奇阻挡子、珍珠、一致区域和循环消除问题等概念，我们深入探讨了量子策略在奇数循环游戏中的最优性，并揭示了其与泡沫问题的联系。

Abstract: We characterize optimality of Quantum strategies for the Odd-Cycle game. Separate from other game-theoretic settings, parallel repetition for the Odd-Cycle game is related to the foam problem, which can be formulated through a minimization of the surface area. In comparison to previous works on minimizing the surface area, we quantify how properties of the marked giant connected component can be related to the maximum winning probability using Quantum strategies. Objects that we introduce to formulate such connections include the topological odd-blocker, previous examples of error bounds for other Quantum games that have been formulated by the author, pearls, consistent regions, and the cycle elimination problem.

### [2] [Testing Single Photon Entanglement using Self-Referential Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21819)
*Daniel Kun,Teodor Strömberg,Borivoje Dakić,Philip Walther,Lee A. Rozema*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new experimental approach demonstrates single-photon nonlocality via joint measurements on two copies of an entangled state, avoiding the complexity of homodyne measurements and achieving significant Bell inequality violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To offer a simpler and more accessible experimental route to demonstrate single-photon nonlocality, avoiding the challenges associated with homodyne measurements.

Method: Violating a Bell inequality by performing joint measurements on two copies of the same single-photon entangled state, where one photon acts as a phase reference for the other.

Result: Observed CHSH parameters of 2.71 ± 0.09 and 2.23 ± 0.07, demonstrating violations of Bell inequality.

Conclusion: The study provides a new experimental method to demonstrate single-photon nonlocality by using joint measurements on two copies of a single-photon entangled state, avoiding the complexity of homodyne measurements and potential loopholes.

Abstract: Entanglement does not always require one particle per party. It was predicted some thirty years ago that a single photon traversing a beam splitter could violate a Bell inequality. Although initially debated, single-photon nonlocality was eventually demonstrated via homodyne measurements. Here, we present an alternate realisation that avoids the complexity of homodyne measurements and potential loopholes in their implementation. We violate a Bell inequality by performing joint measurements on two copies of the same single-photon entangled state, where one photon acts as a phase reference for the other, making it self-referential. We observe CHSH parameters of $2.71\pm 0.09$ and $2.23\pm 0.07$, depending on the joint measurements implemented. This offers a new perspective on single-photon nonlocality and a more accessible experimental route, potentially applicable to general mode-entangled states in diverse platforms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的两量子比特门集设计方法，通过软件补偿提升性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖迭代细化的校准，效率低下且难以扩展，影响了量子计算的性能。

Method: 通过快速表征少量门参数并在电路编译中进行跟踪和校正，将相干贡献视为门定义的一部分，并通过单量子比特旋转进行补偿。

Result: 在127量子位IBM硬件上，验证了该方法在量子傅里叶变换电路和Trotter模拟中的性能提升高达7倍和9倍。

Conclusion: 提供了一种全新的门集扩展方法，减少了对繁琐校准的依赖，显著提升了量子计算性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose and validate on real quantum computing hardware a new method for extended two-qubit gate set design, replacing iterative, fine calibration with fast characterization of a small number of gate parameters which are then tracked and corrected in circuit compilation. Coherent contributions to the pulse unitary that would traditionally be considered sources of error are treated as part of the gate definition, and compensated in software via single-qubit rotations. This approach enables rapid device-wide generation of high-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates, which are combined with standard calibrated gates to produce an expanded gate set. We show how these gates are directly usable as part of a quantum compiler, synthesizing generic two-qubit circuit blocks into minimal-duration sequences of the characterized gates interleaved with compensating single-qubit rotations. Benchmarking against circuits compiled using the default $CX$ gate alone on 127-qubit IBM hardware shows up to 7X improvement in success probability for Quantum Fourier Transform circuits up to 26 qubits, and up to 9X lower mean-square error in Trotter simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. Our hardware-agnostic characterization and compilation methodology makes it practical to scale up expressive gate sets on quantum computing architectures while minimizing the need for onerous fine-tuning of low-level control waveforms.

### [4] [Measure and Forget Dynamics in Random Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21866)
*Yucheng He,Todd A. Brun*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Study of 'forgetful' measurements in random Clifford circuits shows constant thermalization rates and entropy thresholds, challenging prior noise-driven thermalization theories, with implications for quantum error correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effects of 'forgetful' measurements (similar to dephasing) on measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) and understand their role in entanglement and entropy dynamics, particularly for quantum computing applications.

Method: The research employs numerical calculations and analysis of random Clifford circuits with partially forgotten measurement outcomes, focusing on entropy decay behavior and phase transitions.

Result: The findings reveal a constant local thermalization rate regardless of system size and a threshold in entropy evolution that contradicts previous intuitions about noise-driven thermalization. The purification transition also disappears under these conditions.

Conclusion: The study uncovers that 'forgetful' measurements lead to a constant local thermalization rate independent of system size, challenging prior assumptions about noise-induced thermalization in random circuits. It also highlights the disappearance of the purification transition and discusses implications for quantum error-correction codes.

Abstract: "Forgetful" measurements-physically similar to dephasing-are of interest both for applications to fault-tolerant quantum computing and fundamentally, in studying how entanglement and entropy spread. This paper investigates measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in random Clifford circuits when measurement outcomes are partially forgotten. Our findings reveal a local thermalization rate that remains constant regardless of system size. We also numerically calculate the decay behavior at the turning points in the entropy diagram. We observe a counterintuitive phenomenon where the entropy reaches a threshold and stops evolving, even as the system size increases. This challenges an intuition, drawn from previous studies of noisy random circuits, that noise will cause the thermalization of the whole system. Additionally, we identify the disappearance of the purification transition and discuss the implications of these entanglement dynamics for quantum error-correction codes.

### [5] [Accuracy and resource advantages of quantum eigenvalue estimation with non-Hermitian transcorrelated electronic Hamiltonians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21867)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Transcorrelated Hamiltonians reduce qubit needs while matching accuracy and T gate counts of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of non-Hermitian transcorrelated Hamiltonians in quantum algorithms and evaluate their efficiency compared to traditional methods.

Method: The study compares the cost of a quantum eigenvalue estimation algorithm for non-Hermitian transcorrelated Hamiltonians with standard qubitization for non-transcorrelated Hamiltonians, focusing on second-row atoms.

Result: The ground state energy of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian in the STO-6G basis is more accurate than that of a standard Hamiltonian in the cc-pVQZ basis, with comparable T gate counts and a 2.5 times smaller qubit count.

Conclusion: The transcorrelated method, despite its non-Hermitian nature, offers a competitive alternative to traditional methods by reducing qubit count while maintaining comparable accuracy and T gate counts.

Abstract: In electronic structure calculations, the transcorrelated method enables a reduction of the basis set size by incorporating the electron-electron correlations directly into the Hamiltonian. However, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is non-Hermitian, which makes many common quantum algorithms inapplicable. Recently, a quantum eigenvalue estimation algorithm was proposed for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real spectra [FOCS 65, 1051 (2024)]. Here we investigate the cost of this algorithm applied to transcorrelated electronic Hamiltonians of second-row atoms and compare it to the cost of applying standard qubitization to non-transcorrelated Hamiltonians. We find that the ground state energy of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian in the STO-6G basis is more accurate than that of a standard Hamiltonian in the cc-pVQZ basis. The T gate counts of the two methods are comparable, while the qubit count of the transcorrelated method is 2.5 times smaller.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a distributed quantum computing framework to optimize resource usage, addressing core density issues by partitioning qubits and minimizing state transfer overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like fidelity, crosstalk, and power consumption in dense quantum cores by proposing a distributed architecture with optimized state transfer and magic state routing.

Method: The method involves restricting the quantum gate set, transpiling circuits using Qiskit, partitioning qubits with KaHIP, mapping partitions to a 2D mesh via QAPFA, and scheduling gates with timing considerations. Statistics on classical communications, EPR pairs, magic states, and timing overheads are reported.

Result: A framework was developed to analyze and optimize distributed logical quantum computing, providing detailed resource statistics and performance metrics.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive framework for optimizing distributed logical quantum computing architectures, quantifying classical and quantum resources, and offering detailed statistics on communication and timing overheads.

Abstract: Quantum computing platforms are evolving to a point where placing high numbers of qubits into a single core comes with certain difficulties such as fidelity, crosstalk, and high power consumption of dense classical electronics. Utilizing distributed cores, each hosting logical data qubits and logical ancillas connected via classical and quantum communication channels, offers a promising alternative. However, building such a system for logical qubits requires additional optimizations, such as minimizing the amount of state transfer between cores for inter-core two-qubit gates and optimizing the routing of magic states distilled in a magic state factory. In this work, we investigate such a system and its statistics in terms of classical and quantum resources. First, we restrict our quantum gate set to a universal gate set consisting of CNOT, H, T, S, and Pauli gates. We then developed a framework that can take any quantum circuit, transpile it to our gate set using Qiskit, and then partition the qubits using the KaHIP graph partitioner to balanced partitions. Afterwards, we built an algorithm to map these graphs onto the 2D mesh of quantum cores by converting the problem into a Quadratic Assignment Problem with Fixed Assignment (QAPFA) to minimize the routing of leftover two-qubit gates between cores and the total travel of magic states from the magic state factory. Following this stage, the gates are scheduled using an algorithm that takes care of the timing of the gate set. As a final stage, our framework reports detailed statistics such as the number of classical communications, the number of EPR pairs and magic states consumed, and timing overheads for pre- and post- processing for inter-core state transfers. These results help to quantify both classical and quantum resources that are used in distributed logical quantum computing architectures.

Abstract: Photons are promising candidates for quantum information technology due to their high robustness and long coherence time at room temperature. Inspired by the prosperous development of photonic computing techniques, recent research has turned attention to performing quantum machine learning on photonic platforms. Although photons possess a high-dimensional quantum feature space suitable for computation, a general understanding of how to harness it for learning tasks remains blank. Here, we establish both theoretically and experimentally a scalable advantage in quantum machine learning with multi-photon states. Firstly, we prove that the learning capacity of linear optical circuits scales polynomially with the photon number, enabling generalization from smaller training datasets and yielding lower test loss values. Moreover, we experimentally corroborate these findings through unitary learning and metric learning tasks, by performing online training on a fully programmable photonic integrated platform. Our work highlights the potential of photonic quantum machine learning and paves the way for achieving quantum enhancement in practical machine learning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of ancilla errors propagating back to data qubits in quantum error correction, leveraging the noise-biased nature of Kerr-cat qubits.

Method: Experimental demonstration of a beamsplitter interaction between a KCQ and a transmon, characterizing the interaction across various cat sizes and drive amplitudes.

Result: Realization of an effective σ_zσ_x coupling for parity measurements, with confirmed scaling of the interaction rate, supporting hardware-efficient syndrome extraction.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a beamsplitter interaction between a KCQ and a transmon, paving the way for hybrid architectures that enhance quantum error correction.

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires ancilla qubits to extract error syndromes from data qubits which store quantum information. However, ancilla errors can propagate back to the data qubits, introducing additional errors and limiting fault-tolerance. In superconducting quantum circuits, Kerr-cat qubits (KCQs), which exhibit strongly biased noise, have been proposed as ancillas to suppress this back-action and enhance QEC performance. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a beamsplitter interaction between a KCQ and a transmon, realizing an effective $σ_zσ_x$ coupling that can be employed for parity measurements in QEC protocols. We characterize the interaction across a range of cat sizes and drive amplitudes, confirming the expected scaling of the interaction rate. These results establish a step towards hybrid architectures that combine transmons as data qubits with noise-biased bosonic ancillas, enabling hardware-efficient syndrome extraction and advancing the development of fault-tolerant quantum processors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a quantum sensing method that surpasses the standard quantum limit (SQL) and is robust to noise, while remaining state-independent.

Method: The protocol encodes the signal in a geometrical phase proportional to the area in oscillator phase space, amplified through squeezing.

Result: The protocol achieves sensitivities beyond the SQL, is independent of the oscillator's initial state, and remains robust against qubit Markovian noise.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum sensing protocol effectively surpasses the SQL by leveraging a geometrical phase, demonstrating robustness to noise and state-independence, making it practical for advanced quantum metrology applications.

Abstract: We present a quantum sensing protocol for coupled qubit-oscillator systems that surpasses the standard quantum limit (SQL) by exploiting a geometrical phase. The signal is encoded in the geometrical phase that is proportional to the area enclosed in oscillator phase space. This area is amplified through squeezing, enabling sensitivities beyond the SQL. Our method is independent of oscillator's initial state, amenable to sensing with high-temperature or logical error-corrected states. The protocol shows robustness to qubit Markovian noise and preserves its state-independence, underscoring its practicality for next-generation quantum metrology. We demonstrate application to force sensing beyond the SQL in longitudinally coupled systems, and to high-precision measurements of couplings and pulse calibration surpassing SQL in dispersively coupled circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architectures.

TL;DR: The R2D method reduces leakage errors in superconducting transmon qubits, enabling high-fidelity, fast gate operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing requires precise and fast qubit control, but existing methods struggle with unwanted transitions and leakage errors, especially in multilevel systems.

Method: A double recursive implementation of the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, named the R2D method, was used to remove direct transitions beyond nearest-neighbor levels.

Result: The method achieved single qubit gates with leakage errors below $2.0×10−5$ and fidelities above 99.98% for pulse durations as short as 6.8 ns.

Conclusion: The R2D method effectively reduces leakage errors in superconducting transmon qubits, achieving high fidelity and fast gate operations.

Abstract: One of the main enablers in quantum computing is having qubit control that is precise and fast. However, qubits typically have multilevel structures making them prone to unwanted transitions from fast gates. This leakage out of the computational subspace is especially detrimental to algorithms as it has been observed to cause long-lived errors, such as in quantum error correction. This forces a choice between either achieving fast gates or having low leakage. Previous works focus on suppressing leakage by mitigating the first to second excited state transition, overlooking multi-photon transitions, and achieving faster gates with further reductions in leakage has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate single qubit gates with a total leakage error consistently below $2.0\times10^{-5}$, and obtain fidelities above $99.98\%$ for pulse durations down to 6.8 ns for both $X$ and $X/2$ gates. This is achieved by removing direct transitions beyond nearest-neighbor levels using a double recursive implementation of the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, which we name the R2D method. Moreover, we find that at such short gate durations and strong driving strengths the main error source is from these higher order transitions. This is all shown in the widely-used superconducting transmon qubit, which has a weakly anharmonic level structure and suffers from higher order transitions significantly. We also introduce an approach for amplifying leakage error that can precisely quantify leakage rates below $10^{-6}$. The presented approach can be readily applied to other qubit types as well.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the application of nonlinear optical phenomena in quantum information, specifically leveraging the polarization-encoding capabilities of 2D-OIHP quantum wells for quantum communication technologies.

Method: The research uses four-wave-mixing experiments to track femtosecond-scale changes in photon ellipticities, establishing a method for information encoding based on exciton spin dynamics and biexciton correlations. Additionally, the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol is implemented using single-photon detection and polarization state mapping.

Result: The method successfully encodes and transmits a 56-bit ASCII message using photon polarization states, with the information transmission efficiency significantly influenced by biexciton state contributions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the potential of 2D-OIHP quantum wells for quantum communication, leveraging their intrinsic spin-dependent nonlinear optical processes and highlighting the role of biexciton states in enhancing information transmission efficiency.

Abstract: Two-dimensional organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite (2D-OIHP) quantum wells are emerging as promising light sources for quantum communication technologies, owing to their ability to generate polarization-encoded optical signals. In this work, we explore how nonlinear optical phenomena can be exploited for quantum information applications, demonstrating the versatility that arises from resonant coupling among excited states. By tracking changes in the ellipticities of signal photons on femtosecond timescales in four-wave-mixing experiments, we first establish a method for information encoding based on exciton spin dynamics and biexciton correlations. Using single-photon detection, we then implement the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol by mapping these polarization states onto binary sequences. While the polarizations of weak coherent pulses are typically manipulated with optical elements in traditional quantum key distribution approaches, the intrinsic electronic structure and spin relaxation processes within the 2D-OIHP system determine the characteristics of the signal photons in our method. As a demonstration, an ASCII message consisting of 56 bits is transmitted through the polarization states of photons emitted by 2D-OIHP quantum wells. These results show that the information transmission efficiency depends strongly on contributions from biexciton states, highlighting the potential of spin-dependent nonlinear optical processes for quantum communication.

Result: The platform demonstrates a Fano-like response in photon-pressure induced transparency and modified dynamical backaction, including a parametric instability caused by a red-detuned pump tone. The multi-photon coupling rates scale stronger than the usual √n_c dependence.

Conclusion: The realization of a photon-pressure platform with a GHz circuit interacting with a MHz circuit via magnetic-flux-tunable dispersive and dissipative photon-pressure opens new possibilities for exploring unusual parameter regimes of the optomechanical Hamiltonian. Enhanced coupling rates due to nonlinearities and the demonstration of Fano-like response and modified dynamical backaction highlight the platform's potential for applications in quantum photonics and dark matter detection.

Abstract: Photon-pressure circuits are the circuit implementation of the cavity optomechanical Hamiltonian and discussed for qubit readout, low-frequency quantum photonics and dark matter axion detection. Due to the enormous design flexibility of superconducting circuits, photon-pressure systems provide fascinating possibilities to explore unusual parameter regimes of the optomechanical Hamiltonian. Here, we report the realization of a photon-pressure platform, in which a GHz circuit interacts with a MHz circuit via a magnetic-flux-tunable combination of dispersive and dissipative photon-pressure. In addition, both coupling rates are considerably enhanced by nonlinearities of the GHz-mode, which leads to the multi-photon coupling rates scaling stronger with the pump photon number $n_\mathrm{c}$ than the usual $\sqrt{n_\mathrm{c}}$ dependence. We demonstrate that interference of the two interaction paths leads to a Fano-like response in photon-pressure induced transparency, and that the dynamical backaction is considerably modified compared to the dispersive case, including a parametric instability caused by a red-detuned pump tone.

Abstract: Magnonic systems present a compelling platform for quantum technology, owing to their strong capacity to form hybrid quantum systems via diverse couplings. To unlock the full potential of these systems, the engineering of flexible coupling between multiple magnon modes is essential. Here, we propose a method to realize switchable dissipative Ising coupling in magnon systems, leveraging the three-body coupling among photon, phonon, and magnon. This type of dissipative coupling is a critical component for constructing Ising machines designed to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. By dynamically tuning the phase of a nonlinear mechanical pump, we demonstrate the realization of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic dissipative interactions. The validity of the scheme is confirmed by numerical simulations, which also demonstrate its robustness against a strong uncontrollable part of dissipation. Our work provides a versatile tool that can facilitate the implementation of magnon-based quantum computing and the exploration of many-body magnon physics.

TL;DR: QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs are much lower than expected, with HFCs in QPG conductance explaining the discrepancy, aiding fault-tolerant quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies indicate that microwave drives, even at frequencies below the superconducting gap, can cause QPG across Josephson junctions, which is a concern for fault-tolerant quantum computing. This study aims to investigate the actual QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs.

Method: The researchers applied intense drive fields through readout resonators, reaching effective qubit drive amplitudes up to 300 GHz. The nonlinear response of the resonators was used to quantify energy loss from SCQs, including QPG contributions.

Result: Experimental evidence shows QPG rates are remarkably lower than expected. Calculations incorporating high-frequency cutoffs (17-20 GHz) in the QPG conductance can explain the observations, yielding QPG rates orders of magnitude smaller than the ideal model predicts.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the actual drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) rates in strongly driven superconducting qubits (SCQs) are significantly lower than expected, with high-frequency cutoffs in the QPG conductance playing a key role. This finding prevents overestimation of QPG and offers guidance for improving superconducting quantum processors.

Abstract: Microwave drives applied to superconducting qubits (SCQs) are central to high-fidelity control and fast readout. However, recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing. Here, we find experimental evidence that the actual QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs are remarkably lower than expected. We apply intense drive fields through readout resonators, reaching effective qubit drive amplitudes up to 300 GHz. The nonlinear response of the resonators enables quantification of the energy loss from SCQs into their environments, including the contribution from QPG. Even when conservatively attributing all measured dissipation to QPG, the observed energy dissipation rates are far lower than expected from the ideal QPG model. Meanwhile, calculations incorporating high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) near 17-20 GHz in the QPG conductance can explain the experiments. These HFCs yield QPG rates a few orders of magnitude smaller than those without HFCs, providing evidence that the QPG rates are lower than predicted by the ideal model. Our findings prevent overestimation of drive-induced QPG and provide crucial guidance for operating superconducting quantum processors. Identifying the microscopic origin of the discrepancy opens new material and device opportunities to further mitigate QPG.

Abstract: The active manipulation of topologically protected states represents a pivotal frontier for quantum technologies, offering a unique confluence of topological robustness and precise quantum control. We propose an adiabatic pumping scheme for the long-range transfer of topological corner states in a two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The protocol utilizes a modular lattice architecture composed of four topologically distinct subblocks, enabling the modulation of a topological dark state by precise tuning of lattice couplings. This approach is based on coherent tunneling by adiabatic passage among topological corner and interface states. We establish a multi-level model for the adiabatic pumping that provides an accurate description of the underlying mechanism. In comparison with a sequential two-stage Thouless pumping, our protocol offers superior performance in both transfer fidelity and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the classical optical analogue of minimal orthogonality time in quantum mechanics and apply QSL bounds to practical photonic devices for mode conversion and metrology.

Method: Closed-form QSL bounds are derived for nonlocal optical beams using paraxial propagation mapping to a reversed harmonic-oscillator generator. The propagator is constructed, Bures distance evaluated, and analytic Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin bounds obtained.

Result: A propagation-distance limit (PDL) is fixed for mode distinguishability, and a compact self-defocusing PDL beam shaper is proposed, achieving strong transverse-mode conversion. High sensitivities (down to 10^-7 RIU for refractive index and ~1 mK for temperature) are demonstrated.

Conclusion: The study successfully bridges the gap between distance-domain quantum-speed-limit (QSL) geometry and practical photonic applications by proposing a compact beam shaper and demonstrating high-sensitivity metrology capabilities.

Abstract: We derive closed-form analog quantum-speed-limit (QSL) bounds for highly nonlocal optical beams whose paraxial propagation is mapped to a reversed (inverted) harmonic-oscillator generator. Treating the longitudinal coordinate $z$ as an evolution parameter (propagation distance), we construct the propagator, evaluate the Bures distance, and obtain analytic Mandelstam--Tamm and Margolus--Levitin bounds that fix a propagation-distance limit $z_{\mathrm{PDL}}$ to reach a prescribed mode distinguishability. This distance-domain constraint is the classical optical analogue of the minimal orthogonality time in quantum mechanics. We then propose a compact self-defocusing PDL beam shaper that achieves strong transverse-mode conversion within millimeter scales. We further show that small variations in refractive index, beam power, or temperature shift $z_{\mathrm{SL}}$ with high leverage, enabling speed-limit-based metrology with index sensitivities down to $10^{-7}$ RIU and temperature resolutions of order $1$ mK. The results bridge distance-domain QSL geometry and practical photonic applications.

TL;DR: Quantum federated learning (QFL) faces challenges due to heterogeneity in data and systems; this paper examines these issues, evaluates solutions, and suggests future research directions for more robust QFL frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing QFL frameworks that ignore real-world variances like quantum data distributions, encoding techniques, hardware noise, and computational capacity, which can lead to instability and reduced performance.

Method: The paper conducts an in-depth examination of heterogeneity in QFL, classifying it into data and system heterogeneity, and investigates their effects on training convergence and model aggregation.

Result: The paper critically evaluates existing mitigation solutions, identifies their limitations, and presents a case study demonstrating the viability of addressing quantum heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by discussing potential future research areas for building robust and scalable heterogeneous quantum federated learning (QFL) frameworks, emphasizing the need to address real-world variances for improved performance.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) combines quantum computing and federated learning to enable decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy. QFL can improve computational efficiency and scalability by taking advantage of quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement. However, existing QFL frameworks largely focus on homogeneity among quantum \textcolor{black}{clients, and they do not account} for real-world variances in quantum data distributions, encoding techniques, hardware noise levels, and computational capacity. These differences can create instability during training, slow convergence, and reduce overall model performance. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth examination of heterogeneity in QFL, classifying it into two categories: data or system heterogeneity. Then we investigate the influence of heterogeneity on training convergence and model aggregation. We critically evaluate existing mitigation solutions, highlight their limitations, and give a case study that demonstrates the viability of tackling quantum heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss potential future research areas for constructing robust and scalable heterogeneous QFL frameworks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational challenges of electron correlation in extended molecular systems by leveraging hybrid quantum-classical algorithms to reduce problem size and mitigate hardware noise.

Method: Combines Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) to fragment molecules into embedded impurity subproblems and solve reduced configuration spaces using quantum sampling and iterative recovery.

Result: DMET-SQD energies for natural ligand-like molecules in the STO-3G basis set closely match DMET-FCI benchmark values, achieving chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol).

Conclusion: The DMET-SQD method demonstrates strong agreement with DMET-FCI benchmarks within chemical accuracy, showcasing its potential for reliable quantum computation in chemically relevant molecular systems, particularly in drug discovery.

Abstract: The accurate treatment of electron correlation in extended molecular systems remains computationally challenging using classical electronic structure methods. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms offer a potential route to overcome these limitations; however, their practical deployment on existing quantum computers requires strategies that both reduce problem size and mitigate hardware noise. In this work, we combine Density Matrix Embedding Theory (DMET) with Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) to compute ground-state energies of a set of natural ligand-like molecules in the minimal Slater Type Orbital (STO-3G) basis set. DMET provides a systematic fragmentation of a molecule into embedded impurity subproblems, while SQD enables construction and classical diagonalization of reduced configuration spaces through quantum sampling enhanced by iterative configuration recovery. The resulting embedded Hamiltonians are solved on IBM's Eagle R3 superconducting quantum hardware (IBM Sherbrooke). The DMET-SQD energies obtained for all systems considered exhibit strong agreement with DMET-FCI benchmark values within chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). These results demonstrate that sample-based quantum methods, when integrated with a robust embedding framework, can reliably extend quantum computation towards simulation of chemically relevant molecular systems, showcasing potential applications in the field of drug discovery.

### [19] [A Time-Symmetric Formulation of Quantum Measurement: Reinterpreting the Arrow of Time as Information Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22191)
*Shin-ichi Inage*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A time-symmetric quantum measurement framework treats pre- and post-selected statistics equally, showing temporal asymmetry stems from informational conditioning, not dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to restore microscopic reversibility in quantum measurement dynamics while maintaining compatibility with causality and thermodynamic consistency, avoiding stochastic wavefunction collapse.

Method: The method involves a time-symmetric framework for quantum measurement using a bidirectional informational update between forward-evolving states and backward-propagating effects, governed by a completely positive generator and its adjoint. Pre- and post-selected statistics are treated equally.

Result: The framework preserves complete positivity, normalization, and the no-signalling principle, satisfies Spohn's inequality for entropy production, and reduces to classical estimation theory methods (Kalman filter, RTS smoother) in the classical limit.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the temporal asymmetry in quantum measurement arises from informational conditioning rather than fundamental dynamical irreversibility, suggesting the arrow of time in measurement theory is an arrow of information.

Abstract: This study proposes a time-symmetric framework for quantum measurement that restores microscopic reversibility at the level of the dynamical description while remaining compatible with causality and thermodynamic consistency. Instead of invoking a stochastic wavefunction collapse, the measurement process is modeled as a bidirectional informational update between a forward-evolving state and a backward-propagating effect, governed by a completely positive generator and its adjoint. Within this operator-based formalism, pre- and post-selected statistics are treated on an equal footing, yielding a unified description of both. The proposed scheme rigorously preserves complete positivity, normalization, and the no-signalling principle, and it is shown to satisfy Spohn's inequality for the associated quantum Markov semigroup, thereby ensuring non-negative entropy production within this setting. The framework admits a direct experimental interpretation across a range of scenarios, including weak measurements, EPR-Bell tests, homodyne detection, and photon counting. Furthermore, in the classical limit, the bidirectional update is demonstrated to reduce to the well-established Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother used in classical estimation theory. These results support the view that the apparent temporal asymmetry of quantum measurement arises not from fundamental dynamical irreversibility, but from informational conditioning, specifically, the one-sided way in which measurement outcomes are incorporated into our description. In this sense, the arrow of time in measurement theory may be understood as an arrow of information.

Conclusion: 量子最优控制技术在Rydberg原子量子处理器上成功实现了多量子比特门的单激光脉冲实现，显著提高了操作效率和抗噪声能力，特别在Fredkin门中实现了99.74%的高保真度。

Abstract: Quantum computing algorithms can be decomposed into a universal set of elementary one- and two-qubit gates. Different physical implementations of quantum computing, however, employ interactions that permit direct conditional dynamics on multiple qubits in a single step. In this work, we leverage quantum optimal control techniques to design single continuous laser pulses that implement multi-qubit controlled-phase, -NOT and -swap (Fredkin) gates on Rydberg atom quantum processors. The identification of robust multi-qubit operations leads to reduced operation time and less decoherence, and the control field provides continuous protection of the atoms from environmental noise. Notably, we find that the controlled-swap (Fredkin) gate, implemented using this approach achieves 99.74\% fidelity while accounting for imperfections such as spontaneous emission, laser fluctuations, and Doppler dephasing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address a critical limitation in neutral-atom quantum processors: the lack of native exchange and conditional exchange gates. These gates are essential for state verification, fermionic and XY-model simulation, and efficient routing in large qubit arrays.

Method: The method involves lifting the degeneracy between interfering transition pathways to allow a single Rydberg-excited atom to control state exchange between pairs of atoms. This approach realizes a direct controlled-SWAP operation with over 99% fidelity, reduced circuit depth, and minimal exposure to decay and decoherence. The mechanism is tested under Doppler broadening at ~150 μK and realistic laser-intensity noise.

Result: The results show the successful realization of a direct controlled-SWAP (Fredkin) operation with >99% fidelity, an order-of-magnitude reduction in circuit depth, and robustness under Doppler broadening and laser-intensity noise. The mechanism also extends to other useful gates like multi-control conditional exchanges and conditional multiplexed SWAP gates.

Conclusion: The research successfully demonstrates the implementation of a direct controlled-SWAP (Fredkin) operation with high fidelity and reduced circuit depth, along with robustness under practical conditions. This advancement significantly enhances the capabilities of neutral-atom quantum processors, enabling higher-order state-verification protocols, occupation-dependent simulations, and conditional routing across optical lattices.

Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum processors employ Rydberg blockade for multiqubit phase operations but lack similar native exchange and conditional exchange gates, which are essential primitives for state verification, fermionic and XY-model simulation, and efficient routing in large qubit arrays. We demonstrate that by lifting the degeneracy between interfering transition pathways, a single Rydberg-excited atom can control state exchange between pairs of atoms. Using this mechanism, we realize a direct controlled-SWAP (Fredkin) operation with more than 99\% fidelity and an order-of-magnitude reduction in circuit depth and reduced exposure to decay and decoherence of Rydberg state components compared with decomposed implementations. The mechanism operates robustly under Doppler broadening at ~150 $μ$K and realistic laser-intensity noise and extends naturally to an entire family of useful gates, including multi-control conditional exchanges (C$_k$-SWAP) and conditional multiplexed SWAP gates. By incorporating controlled exchange operations as native physical operations on neutral atoms, our work provides multiqubit gates that enable higher-order state-verification protocols, occupation-dependent simulations, and conditional routing across optical lattices.

Motivation: To explore quantum batteries beyond integrable models, focusing on achieving quantum advantage in charging power while ensuring stable energy storage.

Method: The study investigates the sunburst quantum Ising battery driven by periodic delta-kicks, analyzing its performance in both quantum chaotic and integrable regimes.

Result: In the quantum chaotic regime, a quantum advantage is achieved for n_b ≤ 4 with stable energy storage. The integrable regime supports optimal energy storage and extraction for any initial state. The advantage is not due to multipartite entanglement.

Conclusion: The observed quantum advantage in the sunburst quantum Ising battery for small battery numbers (n_b ≤ 4) is classical in nature and does not rely on multipartite entanglement. The quantum chaotic regime offers excellent stability of energy storage, while the integrable regime allows optimal energy storage and extraction regardless of the initial state.

Abstract: Most quantum batteries studied so far with notable exception of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) batteries are based on integrable models, where superlinear scaling of charging power and hence a quantum advantage can be achieved, but at the cost of unstable stored energy due to integrability. Here, by considering the sunburst quantum Ising battery driven by periodic delta-kicks, we show that in the quantum chaotic regime a quantum advantage is achieved for number of batteries $n_b\leq 4$, together with excellent stability of energy storage. In the integrable regime optimal energy storage and extraction are possible irrespective of the initial state of the charger. Finally, we show that the observed advantage does not originate from multipartite entanglement within the battery subsystem and is therefore classical in nature.

Abstract: Continuous monitoring of open quantum-optical systems offers a promising route towards quantum-enhanced estimation precision. In such continuous-measurement-based sensing protocols, the ultimate precision limit is dictated, through the quantum Cramér-Rao bound, by the global quantum Fisher information associated with the joint system-environment state. Reaching this limit with established continuous measurement techniques in quantum optics remains an outstanding challenge. Here we present a sensing protocol tailored for open quantum-optical sensors that exhibit dissipative criticality, enabling them to significantly narrow the gap to the ultimate precision limit. Our protocol leverages a previously unexplored interplay between the quantum criticality and the quantum measurement backaction inherent in continuous general-dyne detection. We identify a performance sweet spot, near which the ultimate precision limit can be efficiently approached. Our protocol establishes a new pathway towards quantum-enhanced precision in open quantum-optical setups and can be extended to other sensor designs featuring similar dissipative criticality.

TL;DR: The paper connects higher-order OTOCs to quantum signal processing, explaining their dynamical sensitivities and introducing OTOC spectroscopy for detailed quantum many-body analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a unified algorithmic interpretation for higher-order OTOCs motivated the authors to explore their connection to quantum signal processing, aiming to understand their behavior in chaotic, integrable, or localized dynamics.

Method: The authors embed higher-order OTOCs within the quantum signal processing (QSP) framework, demonstrating that each OTOC measures specific Fourier components of the phase distribution linked to the singular values of a spatially resolved truncated propagator.

Result: The research reveals that higher-order OTOCs can be generalized via polynomial transformations of singular values, leading to the development of OTOC spectroscopy for frequency-selective probing of scrambling and spectral structure.

Conclusion: The study establishes a unified algorithmic interpretation for higher-order OTOCs through quantum signal processing, revealing their sensitivity to dynamical structures and enabling the development of OTOC spectroscopy as a mode-resolved tool for probing quantum many-body dynamics.

Abstract: Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) are central probes of quantum scrambling, and their generalizations have recently become key primitives for both benchmarking quantum advantage and learning the structure of Hamiltonians. Yet their behavior has lacked a unified algorithmic interpretation. We show that higher-order OTOCs naturally fit within the framework of quantum signal processing (QSP): each $\mathrm{OTOC}^{(k)}$ measures the $2k$-th Fourier component of the phase distribution associated with the singular values of a spatially resolved truncated propagator. This explains the contrasting sensitivities of time-ordered correlators (TOCs) and higher-order OTOCs to causal-cone structure and to chaotic, integrable, or localized dynamics. Based on this understanding, we further generalize higher-order OTOCs by polynomial transformation of the singular values of the spatially resolved truncated propagator. The resultant signal allows us to construct frequency-selective filters, which we call \emph{OTOC spectroscopy}. This extends conventional OTOCs into a mode-resolved tool for probing scrambling and spectral structure of quantum many-body dynamics.

Abstract: Graph states form a large family of quantum states that are in one-to-one correspondence with mathematical graphs. Graph states are used in many applications, such as measurement-based quantum computation, as multipartite entangled resources. It is thus crucial to understand when two such states have the same entanglement, i.e. when they can be transformed into each other using only local operations. In this case, we say that the graph states are LU-equivalent (local unitary). If the local operations are restricted to the so-called Clifford group, we say that the graph states are LC-equivalent (local Clifford). Interestingly, a simple graph rule called local complementation fully captures LC-equivalence, in the sense that two graph states are LC-equivalent if and only if the underlying graphs are related by a sequence of local complementations. While it was once conjectured that two LU-equivalent graph states are always LC-equivalent, counterexamples do exist and local complementation fails to fully capture the entanglement of graph states. We introduce in this thesis a generalization of local complementation that does fully capture LU-equivalence. Using this characterization, we prove the existence of an infinite strict hierarchy of local equivalences between LC- and LU-equivalence. This also leads to the design of a quasi-polynomial algorithm for deciding whether two graph states are LU-equivalent, and to a proof that two LU-equivalent graph states are LC-equivalent if they are defined on at most 19 qubits. Furthermore, we study graph states that are universal in the sense that any smaller graph state, defined on any small enough set of qubits, can be induced using only local operations. We provide bounds and an optimal, probabilistic construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the physical origins of quantum enhancements in metrology, particularly how indefinite causal order and non-commutativity between operators can surpass classical precision bounds.

Method: The study introduces the nilpotency index $ackslash mathcal{K}$ and theoretically analyzes its role in governing quantum-enhanced sensing, including scaling laws and the necessity of indefinite causal order.

Result: The results show that a finite $ackslash mathcal{K}$ enables enhanced precision scaling ($N^{-(1+ackslash mathcal{K})}$), and exponential scaling ($N^{-1}e^{-N}$) is achievable as $ackslash mathcal{K} 	o ackslash infty$. Practical experimental protocols are proposed.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the nilpotency index $ackslash mathcal{K}$ is a fundamental parameter for quantum-enhanced sensing, demonstrating enhanced precision scaling and introducing experimentally feasible protocols.

Abstract: A central challenge in quantum metrology is to effectively harness quantum resources to surpass classical precision bounds. Although recent studies suggest that the indefinite causal order may enable sensitivities to attain the super-Heisenberg scaling, the physical origins of such enhancements remain elusive. Here, we introduce the nilpotency index $\mathcal{K}$, which quantifies the depth of non-commutativity between operators during the encoding process, can act as a fundamental parameter governing quantum-enhanced sensing. We show that a finite $\mathcal{K}$ yields an enhanced scaling of root-mean-square error as $N^{-(1+\mathcal{K})}$. Meanwhile, the requirement for indefinite causal order arises only when the nested commutators become constant. Remarkably, in the limit $\mathcal{K} \to \infty$, exponential precision scaling $N^{-1}e^{-N}$ is achievable. We propose experimentally feasible protocols implementing these mechanisms, providing a systematic pathway towards practical quantum-enhanced metrology.

Motivation: Harmonic oscillators are promising for continuous-variable quantum computing but require efficient non-Gaussian operations for full potential. Current schemes are limited to single modes, necessitating a more versatile approach.

Method: The method involves decomposing a target Hamiltonian into a Fourier series and implementing its terms using bosonic quantum signal processing, where a discrete-variable (DV) system induces nonlinearity in the continuous-variable (CV) system.

Result: The introduced method allows for the generation of both anharmonicities and nonlinear multi-mode couplings, enabling the simulation of a wide range of CV phenomena and enhancing CV circuit compilation tools.

Conclusion: The hybrid CV-DV protocol proposed in the paper enables the implementation of arbitrary non-Gaussian operations in both single- and multi-mode systems, significantly expanding the potential applications of harmonic oscillators in quantum computing and simulation.

Abstract: Harmonic oscillators are promising continuous-variable (CV) quantum resources because their infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces allow for resource-efficient quantum computing and simulation. To reach their full potential, CV platforms need to be able to efficiently implement non-Gaussian operations. However, schemes for generating arbitrary non-Gaussian operations are restricted to single modes, i.e., the implementation of anharmonic potentials. Here, we introduce a method for implementing arbitrary non-Gaussian operations applicable to both single- and multi-mode systems, allowing the generation of both anharmonicities and nonlinear multi-mode couplings. Our method synthesizes a target Hamiltonian by decomposing it into a Fourier series whose terms are implemented via bosonic quantum signal processing, which uses a discrete-variable (DV) system to induce a nonlinearity in the CV system. Our hybrid CV-DV protocol allows for the direct simulation of a broad range of CV phenomena (such as those in lattice gauge theory, chemical dynamics, and quantum chaos) and provides a richer toolbox for CV circuit compilation.

Result: The technique systematically converges to the first optically accessible excited state, allows targeting different symmetry sectors via photon polarization, and achieves high-fidelity excited state preparation for various systems.

Conclusion: The proposed physically motivated adiabatic state preparation technique successfully targets low-lying excited states and demonstrates high-fidelity results across different systems, including the Hubbard model and methylene molecule, with practical hardware implementation.

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to transform simulations of quantum many-body problems at the heart of electronic structure theory. Efficient quantum algorithms to compute the eigenstates of fermionic Hamiltonians, such as quantum phase estimation, rely critically on high-accuracy initial state preparation. While several state preparation algorithms have been proposed for fermionic ground states, the preparation of excited states remains a major challenge, limiting the applicability of quantum algorithms to photochemistry and photophysics. In this contribution, we describe a physically motivated adiabatic state preparation technique for low-lying excited states using the explicit coupling between electrons and photons. Our approach systematically converges to the first optically accessible excited state and can target different symmetry sectors by changing the photon polarization. We demonstrate the preparation of high-fidelity excited states for the Hubbard model and methylene molecule across a range of correlation regimes, and perform a successful hardware implementation for a model Hamiltonian.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Non-Markovian dynamics from time delays fragment superradiant bursts into structured photon trains and enhance entanglement, with Dicke state decay rates surpassing Markovian limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how non-Markovian dynamics, particularly finite time delays in photon exchange, influence the superradiant decay of emitters in a waveguide, and to quantify the resulting entanglement.

Method: Tensor-network methods were employed to investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide, focusing on finite time delays in photon exchange.

Result: The superradiant burst breaks into a train of correlated photons, with emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement emerging over time. The symmetric Dicke state exhibits decay rates exceeding Markovian predictions due to time delays.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that non-Markovian dynamics due to time delays can significantly alter superradiant decay, leading to structured photon emission and enhanced entanglement. The symmetric Dicke state's decay rate can surpass Markovian predictions, highlighting the importance of time-delay effects in quantum systems.

Abstract: An array of initially excited emitters coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide exhibits superradiant decay under the Born-Markov approximation, manifested as a coherent burst of photons in the output field. In this work, we employ tensor-network methods to investigate its non-Markovian dynamics induced by finite time delays in photon exchange among the emitters. We find that the superradiant burst breaks into a structured train of correlated photons, each intensity peak corresponding to a specific photon number. We quantify the emitter-photon and emitter-emitter entanglement generated during this process and show that the latter emerges in the long-time limit, as part of the excitation becomes trapped within the emitters' singlet subspace. We finally consider the decay of the system's most radiant state, the symmetric Dicke state, and show that time delay can lead to decay rates exceeding those predicted by the Markovian approximation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the disparate definitions of collective effects across different contexts and communities, facilitating transferability of results and broader applications.

Method: The authors employ the Dicke framework to harmonize definitions and analyze collective effects in absorption, emission, and transfer.

Result: A common framework is established, generalizing known collective effects to new systems and demonstrating robustness against disorder and noise.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified framework using the Dicke model to describe collective effects across different contexts, enabling generalization to new systems and improved robustness against disorder and noise.

Abstract: Collective effects, such as superradiance and subradiance are central to emerging quantum technologies -- from sensing to energy storage -- and play an important role in light-harvesting. These effects enhance or suppress rates of dynamic processes (absorption, emission, and transfer) due to the formation of symmetric or antisymmetric collective states. However, collective effects in different contexts -- absorption, emission, and transfer -- have often been defined disparately, especially across different communities, leading to results that are not immediately transferable between different contexts. Here, we describe all three types of collective effects using a common Dicke framework that resolves the apparent discrepancies between different approaches. It allows us to generalise previously known collective effects involving spins into new ones involving aggregates of harmonic oscillators or other degrees of freedom. It also explains how collective effects can be engineered to be robust against both disorder and noise, paving the way for more resilient quantum devices.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum resource degradation theory based on observational entropy decomposition reveals coherence degradation into noise and aids in diagnosing issues like barren plateaus in quantum algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional scalar measures in quantum resource theories fail to capture the evolution of resource quality under free operations, prompting the development of a more detailed decomposition-based approach.

Method: A decomposition of observational entropy is used to separate the total inconsistency measure into inter-block coherence and intra-block noise, revealing the degradation mechanism. The theory is validated through numerical experiments on Variational Quantum Algorithms.

Result: The decomposition shows that quantum coherence degrades into classical noise under specific free operations, quantified by the resource purity metric. The theory is shown to be useful in diagnosing the barren plateau phenomenon.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum resource degradation theory provides a detailed framework for understanding the dynamics of resource quality, offering new insights into the degradation of quantum coherence into classical noise under free operations. It also demonstrates practical utility in diagnosing issues like the barren plateau phenomenon in VQAs.

Abstract: In quantum resource theories, traditional scalar measures often fail to capture the evolution of the quality of a resource under free operations. To address this limitation, we propose a quantum resource degradation theory based on the decomposition of observational entropy. We demonstrate that the total inconsistency measure, $\mathcal{O}_{\mathcal{C}}$, can be decomposed into two independent components: inter-block coherence, $\mathcal{C}_{\text{rel}}$, and intra-block noise, $\mathcal{D}_{\text{rel}}$. This decomposition reveals a significant degradation mechanism: under specific free operations, quantum coherence degrades into classical noise. Consequently, even when the total resource quantity is conserved, its quality decreases. This is quantified by the resource purity metric, $η$. Our theory provides greater detail than conventional approaches that rely solely on monotonicity. It also establishes a new framework for understanding quantum resource dynamics. We validate the theory through numerical experiments on Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), demonstrating its utility in diagnosing and explaining the barren plateau phenomenon (BPP). The proposed framework establishes a new paradigm for managing resource quality, complementing traditional resource quantification. This contributes to the optimization of quantum technologies on current and near-term noisy quantum devices.

Abstract: We propose a quantum-enhanced picostrain sensor that achieves Heisenberg-limited strain sensing using superconducting qubits. A strain-sensitive qubit s Hamiltonian is coupled to the momentum quadrature of a microwave resonator, transducing mechanical strain $ε$ into amplified spatial displacements of the resonator s phase space. Using homodyne detection of the resonator field and multipartite entanglement of N qubits, the protocol achieves a strain sensitivity $Δε\sim pε$ (picostrain), two orders of magnitude better than classical sensors. The scheme integrates natively with superconducting processors, enabling in-situ diagnostic and nanoscale material characterization.

Abstract: Catalysis refers to the possibility of performing an otherwise impossible local state transformation by sharing an additional state, i.e. a catalyst, which is returned at the end of the protocol. There is a stronger version, known as supercatalysis, in which the borrowed catalyst is returned in an enhanced form, i.e. more entangled. However, this phenomenon has remained little explored. In this work we introduce the supercatalytic entanglement gain as a figure of merit taking values in [0,1] that quantifies the performance of the protocol (with 0 corresponding to the standard case of catalysis and 1 representing the maximal possible gain) and we study in which cases it can be greater than zero and which strategies can maximize it. While it turns out that every catalytic transformation can be implemented in a supercatalytic fashion with entanglement gain equal to 1 if the state that is borrowed is chosen appropriately, other choices can make the gain strictly less than 1 and even 0. In fact, we prove that a large class of catalytic transformations are not fully supercatalyzable, i.e. there is at least one choice of catalyst for which the entanglement gain vanishes. On the other hand, the construction that shows that supercatalysis is always possible with maximal gain uses artificially highly entangled catalysts. For this reason, we also study minimal supercatalysis, where the entanglement content of the borrowed state is constrained in a precise and natural way. While we consider a scenario where we prove it is impossible to have entanglement gain equal to 1 in this case, we show that there exist minimal supercatalytic transformations with gain as close to 1 as desired. We also explore several examples and observe that, although choosing a catalyst with the least possible entanglement is often an optimal strategy for minimal supercatalysis, this is not necessarily always the case.

TL;DR: The paper shows that Kac rescaling of the coupling constant in a quantum interferometer can restore Heisenberg-limited sensitivity, depending on the environment model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the coupling between a quantum interferometer and its environment affects sensitivity, specifically whether Heisenberg-limited sensitivity can be maintained.

Method: Analysis of the Lindblad equation with and without Kac rescaling of the coupling constant, using a linear coupling and harmonic model of the environment.

Result: Heisenberg-limited sensitivity may be restored after Kac rescaling of the coupling constant, highlighting the dependency on the extensivity of the coupling Hamiltonian.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of characterizing the environment model in quantum interferometers, as the Heisenberg-limited sensitivity can be restored after Kac rescaling of the coupling constant.

Abstract: Studying the performance of a quantum interferometer coupled to an external environment is a problem of conceptual and practical importance. If we consider a quantum interferometer featuring Heisenberg-limited sensitivity, then a typical result is that introducing coupling with the environment degrades the sensitivity to the shot-noise limit. Here we argue that this result crucially depends on whether the interferometer-environment coupling term is subject (or not) to the so-called Kac rescaling that restores extensivity, i.e., whether the coupling Hamiltonian is extensive or not. We present results of the Lindblad equation in the presence and absence of Kac rescaling of the coupling constant. Our results show that for a linear coupling and a harmonic model of the environment, often used in modeling of a quantum interferometer coupled with an environment, the Heisenberg-limited sensitivity may be restored after the Kac rescaling. This result points out the need and the importance to characterize the (model of the) environment of the interferometer at hand.

TL;DR: Derived replica field theory for monitored quantum systems, analyzed Ising chain dynamics, and studied entanglement implications using a Non-Linear Sigma Model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of monitored quantum many-body systems under quantum jumps protocol and its implications for entanglement phases.

Method: Derivation of replica field theory for monitored quantum many-body systems, analysis of Keldysh action, and study of Ising chain with tunable anisotropy.

Result: Identified replica-diagonal and off-diagonal saddle points, derived effective field theory as a Non-Linear Sigma Model, and classified symmetry classes (DIII or D) based on Ising chain parameters.

Conclusion: The theoretical framework and findings provided here offer a deeper understanding of the entangling phase observed in monitored quantum many-body systems, particularly for the Ising chain with density monitoring.

Abstract: In this work we derive the replica field theory for monitored quantum many-body systems evolving under the quantum jumps protocol, corresponding to a non-Hermitian evolution interspersed with random quantum jumps whose distribution is state-dependent. We show that the density matrix of $R$ replicas evolves according to a master equation where the non-Hermitian term is replica-diagonal while coupling among replicas are due to quantum jumps. We write down the associated Keldysh action and study its behavior for the specific case of the Ising Chain with monitoring of particle density and tunable anisotropy, interpolating between free fermions with strong U(1) symmetry and the Ising chain with Z$_2$ symmetry. We derive the effective field theory in terms of slowly varying fields and obtain the replica-diagonal saddle point, which we show to describe the average state. We then go beyond saddle point and derive the effective field theory describing the replica off-diagonal sector, which takes the form of a Non-Linear Sigma Model. The symmetry class is either DIII or D, depending on the parameters of the Ising chain, except at a special symmetric point, where we recover the results for free fermions. We discuss the implications of these findings for the entangling phase observed numerically for the monitored Ising chain.

Motivation: To address fundamental limitations in spectral computation for non-Hermitian problems and overcome issues like spurious modes and truncation-induced symmetry breaking.

Method: Introduces the concept of locally trivial pseudospectra (LTP) to dynamically adapt to system energies, enabling error-controlled spectral analysis in challenging non-Hermitian settings.

Result: Successful computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the imaginary cubic oscillator with error bounds, providing the first error-controlled result, including the 100th eigenvalue.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a rigorous framework linking quantum mechanics and computation, providing a tool for spectral calculations with error bounds and overcoming longstanding obstacles in non-Hermitian problems.

Abstract: We establish a connection between quantum mechanics and computation, revealing fundamental limitations for algorithms computing spectra, especially in non-Hermitian settings. Introducing the concept of locally trivial pseudospectra (LTP), we show such assumptions are necessary for spectral computation. LTP adapts dynamically to system energies, enabling spectral analysis across a broad class of challenging non-Hermitian problems. Exploiting this framework, we overcome a longstanding obstacle by computing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the imaginary cubic oscillator $H_{\mathrm{B}} = p^2 + i x^3$ with error bounds and no spurious modes -- yielding, to our knowledge, the first such error-controlled result. We confirm, for instance, the 100th eigenvalue as $627.6947122484365113526737029011536\ldots$. Here, truncation-induced $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking causes spurious eigenvalues -- a pitfall our method avoids, highlighting the link between truncation and physics. Finally, we illustrate the approach's generality via spectral computations for a range of physically relevant operators. This letter provides a rigorous framework linking computational theory to quantum mechanics and offers a precise tool for spectral calculations with error bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the degradation of CCSD approximation and energy accuracy caused by ansatz truncation and connectivity constraints in near-term quantum processors.

Method: Two methods are proposed: compressed double factorization of CCSD amplitudes for better approximation, and approximate tensor network simulation for improved sample quality.

Result: Experimental validation on systems of up to 52 qubits (simulation) and 65 qubits (hardware) shows significant improvement.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly improve the output of quantum algorithms by enhancing parameter initialization and sample quality.

Abstract: The unitary cluster Jastrow (UCJ) ansatz and its variant known as local UCJ (LUCJ) are promising choices for variational quantum algorithms for chemistry due to their combination of physical motivation and hardware efficiency. The parameters of these ansatzes can be initialized from the output of a coupled cluster, singles and doubles (CCSD) calculation performed on a classical computer. However, truncating the number of repetitions of the ansatz, as well as discarding interactions to accommodate the connectivity constraints of near-term quantum processors, degrade the approximation to CCSD and the resulting energy accuracy. In this work, we propose two methods to improve the parameter initialization. The first method, which is applicable to both expectation value- and sample-based algorithms, uses compressed double factorization of the CCSD amplitudes to improve or recover the CCSD approximation. The second method, which is applicable to sample-based algorithms, uses approximate tensor network simulation to improve the quality of samples produced by the ansatz circuit. We validate our methods using exact state vector simulation on systems of up to 52 qubits, as well as experiments on superconducting quantum processors using up to 65 qubits. Our results indicate that our methods can significantly improve the output of both expectation value- and sample-based quantum algorithms.

Result: Observation of a normalized second-order intensity correlation dip significantly below the classical limit of 0.5, with tunable noise suppression.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of using conditionally prepared classical states to simulate quantum interference phenomena in the radio-frequency domain, opening possibilities for quantum protocols in unconventional frequency ranges.

Abstract: We report an experimental demonstration of room-temperature Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference at a radio-wave frequency of 120 MHz using conditional build-up of quantum states from classical phase-averaged coherent states. This approach enables observation of quantum effects in spectral regimes where conventional single-photon sources and detectors are unavailable or require cryogenic conditions. By constructing a high-fidelity approximation of a single-photon state with phase-averaged coherent states, we observe the normalized second-order intensity correlation dips significantly below the classical limit of 0.5. The method allows for tunable noise suppression via optimization of the state representation. Our results establish the feasibility of using conditionally prepared classical states to simulate quantum interference phenomena in the radio-frequency domain. This technique opens the door to realizing other quantum protocols, such as Bell inequality tests, in frequency ranges where standard quantum technologies are currently infeasible.

Conclusion: The results establish SiCOI as a versatile platform for integrated photonics, electronics, and spin-based devices for scalable quantum technologies across a wide range of excitation wavelengths.

Abstract: We report electrical spin state readout and coherent control of a small ensemble (<450) of silicon vacancies in a silicon carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) platform, with excitation wavelengths from 780 to 990 nm. Demonstrating for the first time spin state readout well beyond the zero phonon line of the V2 silicon vacancies. By implementing photoelectrical detection of magnetic resonance (PDMR) in thin-film SiCOI, we merge a scalable and optics-free spin readout technique together with a promising platform for scalable and CMOS-compatible integrated photonics. Furthermore, we provide a comparison of optical and electrical readout between bulk SiC and thin-film SiCOI, revealing that our thin-film processing has no significant effect on the bulk T2 time of ~ 7 microseconds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to fill the knowledge gap regarding fidelity-optimal quantum measurements for singular density operators, as the existing understanding is limited despite fidelity being a standard measure for over thirty years.

Method: The study addresses the structure of fidelity-optimal quantum measurements when density operators are singular, focusing on minimal optimal measurements. It analyzes commutativity conditions and uses Bloch-sphere representation for pure states.

Result: The results show the existence of either a unique minimal optimal measurement or infinitely many, contingent on a weak commutativity condition. A complete characterization for pure states is provided using Bloch-sphere geometry.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that minimal optimal measurements for fidelity between quantum states either have a unique solution or infinitely many inequivalent choices, depending on the states' commutativity. It also leverages geometric insights for pure states.

Abstract: Fidelity is the standard measure for quantifying the similarity between two quantum states. It is equal to the square of the minimum Bhattacharyya coefficient between the probability distributions induced by quantum measurements on the two states. Though established for over thirty years, the structure of fidelity-optimal quantum measurements remains unclear when the two density operators are singular (not invertible). Here we address this gap, with a focus on minimal optimal measurements, which admit no nontrivial coarse graining that is still optimal. We show that there exists either a unique minimal optimal measurement or infinitely many inequivalent choices. Moreover, the first case holds if and only if the two density operators satisfy a weak commutativity condition. In addition, we provide a complete characterization of all minimal optimal measurements when one state is pure, leveraging geometric insights from the Bloch-sphere representation. The connections with quantum incompatibility, operator pencils, and geometric means are highlighted.

TL;DR: A new quantum fidelity estimation protocol using CRM and Clifford group shadows drastically reduces resource demands, requiring fewer circuits and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional fidelity estimation protocols are resource-intensive, requiring 1/ε² circuits and samples for high-precision estimation, which is impractical for large quantum systems.

Method: The protocol leverages common randomized measurements (CRM) combined with shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, requiring only 1/ε circuits or even a constant number of circuits in practical scenarios.

Result: The proposed method reduces the required circuits to 1/ε, and in practical cases (e.g., with depolarizing or Pauli noise), only a constant number of circuits is needed, often just one for large systems.

Conclusion: The proposed CRM shadow estimation protocol, integrated with the Clifford group, significantly reduces the resource requirements for high-precision fidelity estimation of multiqubit quantum states. It outperforms conventional and thrifty shadow estimation methods, especially in scenarios with depolarizing or Pauli noise.

Abstract: Efficient fidelity estimation of multiqubit quantum states is crucial to many applications in quantum information processing. However, to estimate the infidelity $ε$ with multiplicative precision, conventional estimation protocols require (order) $1/ε^2$ different circuits in addition to $1/ε^2$ samples, which is quite resource-intensive for high-precision fidelity estimation. Here we introduce an efficient estimation protocol by virtue of common randomized measurements (CRM) integrated with shadow estimation based on the Clifford group, which only requires $1/ε$ circuits. Moreover, in many scenarios of practical interest, in the presence of depolarizing or Pauli noise for example, our protocol only requires a constant number of circuits, irrespective of the infidelity $ε$ and the qubit number. For large and intermediate quantum systems, quite often one circuit is already sufficient. In the course of study, we clarify the performance of CRM shadow estimation based on the Clifford group and 4-designs and highlight its advantages over standard and thrifty shadow estimation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of generating and observing mixed Schrödinger cat states in an optical waveguide, supported by accurate numerical simulations.

Abstract: Pure states are usually used to observe quantum phenomena. In this study, we show that a quantum superposition of spatially displaced mixed cat states can be generated within an optical waveguide via nonparaxial unitary evolution of the initial low coherence (low purity) light beam. It is shown that highly mixed Schrodinger cat states can be observed at a well-defined propagation distance. The importance of the long-term decoherence and recoherence of the original wave packet in observing the mixed cat states is demonstrated. The Heisenberg and Schrodinger-Robertson uncertainty relations for mixed cat states are evaluated. We have demonstrated the feasibility of our method using accurate numerical simulations for the parameters of the source and optical waveguide available in practice.

Method: The approach involves lifting unitary circuit verification through deferred measurement and incorporating specific unitary-level techniques (separation and projection) to handle hybrid circuit equivalence.

Result: The proposed method outperforms prior work and can handle a broader range of hybrid circuit equivalence problems, as validated through testing on standard circuit transformations and the Qiskit compiler.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the proposed method using deferred measurement, along with techniques like separation and projection, significantly outperforms prior approaches in verifying hybrid quantum circuits, while also uncovering unexpected behaviors in the Qiskit compiler.

Abstract: Equivalence checking of hybrid quantum circuits is of primary importance, given that quantum circuit transformations are omnipresent along the quantum compiler chain. While some approaches exist for automating this task, most focus on the simple case of unitary circuits. At the same time, real quantum computing requires hybrid circuits equipped with measurement operators. Moreover, the few approaches targeting the hybrid case are limited to a restricted class of problems. We propose tackling the Quantum Hybrid Circuit Equivalence Checking problem through lifting unitary circuit verification using a transformation known as deferred measurement. We show that this approach alone significantly outperforms prior work, and that, with the addition of specific unitary-level techniques we call separation and projection, it can handle much larger classes of hybrid circuit equivalence problems. We have implemented and evaluated our method over standard circuit transformations such as teleportation, one-way measurement, or the IBM Qiskit compiler, demonstrating its promises. As a side finding, we have identified and reported several unexpected behaviours with the Qiskit compiler.

TL;DR: Simple Bell-like inequalities for communicating parties under causal constraints are derived, with weakly causal correlations defined and shown to be efficiently verifiable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend Bell inequalities to scenarios involving multiple communicating parties constrained by different causal orders.

Method: The authors derive Bell-like inequalities for communicating parties under static, definite, and bi-causal orders, focusing on graphical games where parties communicate along directed graphs.

Result: Simple inequalities are derived for graphical games, and weakly causal correlations are introduced with polynomial-time decision complexity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by defining weakly causal correlations based on kefalopoda inequalities and shows that determining such correlations is computationally efficient.

Abstract: Bell inequalities limit the possible observations of non-communicating parties. Here, we present analogous inequalities for any number of communicating parties under the causal constraints of static causal order, definite causal order, and bi-causal order. All derived inequalities are remarkably simple. They correspond to upper bounds on the winning chance in graphical games: Given a specific directed graph over the parties, the parties are challenged to communicate along a randomly chosen arc. In the case of definite causal order, every game that we find is specified by a kefalopoda digraph. Based on this we define weakly causal correlations as those that satisfy all kefalopoda inequalities. We show that the problem of deciding whether some correlations are weakly causal is solvable in polynomial time in the number of parties.

TL;DR: GRAPE-derived robust pulses outperform DRAG in suppressing errors from parameter fluctuations and time-dependent noise in superconducting qubit gates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter fluctuations due to qubit instabilities, environmental changes, and control inaccuracies hinder the maintenance of high-fidelity single-qubit gates in superconducting transmon qubits.

Method: Gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) is used to numerically derive gates robust to amplitude and frequency errors, analyzing the impact of qubit frequency fluctuations, drive amplitude, and coherence on gate performance.

Result: The robust pulses suppress coherent errors from drive amplitude drifts over 15 times more than Gaussian pulses with DRAG corrections and reduce added errors during dephasing increases by up to 1.7 times more than DRAG.

Conclusion: The robust pulses derived using GRAPE significantly suppress errors caused by parameter fluctuations and time-dependent noise, outperforming traditional DRAG corrections.

Abstract: State-of-the-art single-qubit gates on superconducting transmon qubits can achieve the fidelities required for error-corrected computations. However, parameter fluctuations due to qubit instabilities, environmental changes, and control inaccuracies make it difficult to maintain this performance. To mitigate the effects of these parameter variations, we numerically derive gates robust to amplitude and frequency errors using gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE). We analyze how fluctuations in qubit frequency, drive amplitude, and coherence affect gate performance over time. The robust pulses suppress coherent errors from drive amplitude drifts over 15 times more than a Gaussian pulse with derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) corrections. Furthermore, the robust gates, originally designed to compensate for quasi-static errors, also demonstrate resilience to stochastic, time-dependent noise, which is reflected in the dephasing time. They suppress added errors during increases in dephasing by up to 1.7 times more than DRAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to efficiently construct Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs) for Lie Algebras, crucial in quantum chemistry and other domains, motivates the development of a scalable and optimal approach.

Method: The strategy leverages Lie-Algebraic basic properties to identify minimal sets of generators, overcoming the computational intractability of classical greedy methods.

Result: The method enables efficient construction of MCPs, reducing quantum resources and improving convergence in adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) applications. It also unlocks fixed-ansatz methods like NI-DUCC-VQE.

Conclusion: The proposed Lie-Algebraic framework provides a polynomial-scaling and optimal strategy for constructing Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs), enabling efficient applications in quantum chemistry and other fields requiring compact Pauli basis.

Abstract: Lie Algebras are powerful mathematical structures used in physics to describe sets of operators and associated combinations. A central task is to identify a minimal set of generators from which the algebra can be constructed. The classical search for such generators has so far relied on greedy construction steps applied to an exponentially growing number of candidate operators, making it rapidly computationally intractable. We propose a general, polynomial-scaling and optimal strategy, based on Lie-Algebraic basic properties, to overcome this bottleneck. It allows for the efficient construction of these generators, also known as Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs), for a target Lie Algebra. As an immediate application, efficiently constructing user-defined MCPs that respect fermionic algebra is crucial in the context of adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver for quantum chemistry. Thus, we introduce MB-ADAPT-VQE, which incorporates optimally constructed MCPs into batched ADAPT-VQE to reduce quantum resources and improve convergence under strong correlation. These MCPs also unlock fixed-ansatz methods based on a Lie-algebraic structure such as the gradient-free NI-DUCC-VQE, enabling simulations surpassing prior MCP limits. The presented mathematical framework is general and applicable well beyond chemistry in fields including quantum error correction, quantum control, quantum machine learning, and more universally wherever compact Pauli basis are required.

TL;DR: A study demonstrates oxygen-ion implantation as an efficient method to create high-quality spin-active defects in 4H-SiC, addressing low yield limitations and enhancing quantum applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modified divacancies in 4H-SiC are attractive for quantum applications but have low formation yield, limiting progress. The study aimed to develop a controllable and efficient method to address this limitation.

Method: The researchers used oxygen-ion implantation to generate modified divacancy color centers in 4H-SiC. They optimized implantation dose and annealing temperature to achieve high-density ensembles and studied the defects' optical and spin-resonance characteristics.

Result: The method produced four types of modified divacancies, with single defects constituting over 90% of the population. These defects exhibited superior optical properties and spin coherence compared to those created via conventional methods. High-density ensembles with clear Rabi-oscillation beating patterns were achieved.

Conclusion: The study establishes oxygen-ion implantation as an effective method for generating high-quality spin-active defects in 4H-SiC, advancing scalable solid-state quantum technologies. It also provides insights into the atomic configurations of modified divacancies.

Abstract: Modified divacancies in the 4H polytype of silicon carbide (SiC) exhibit enhanced charge stability and spin addressability at room temperature, making them highly attractive for quantum applications. However, their low formation yield, both at the single-defect and ensemble levels, has limited further progress. Here, we demonstrate a controllable and efficient method for generating modified divacancy color centers in 4H-SiC via oxygen-ion implantation. Based on their distinct optical signatures and spin-resonance characteristics, we experimentally resolve four types of modified divacancies. Remarkably, single modified divacancies constitute above 90% of the total defect population and exhibit superior optical properties and spin coherence compared with defects created through conventional carbon- or nitrogen-ion implantation. We characterize the zero-phonon lines of these modified divacancies and reveal a distinct temperature-dependent behavior in the spin-readout contrast. By systematically optimizing the implantation dose and annealing temperature, we further achieve high-density ensembles and observe clear Rabi-oscillation beating patterns associated with different orientations of basal-type defects. These results establish oxygen-ion implantation as a powerful and versatile approach to engineering high-quality spin-active defects in SiC, representing a significant advance toward scalable solid-state quantum technologies. Furthermore, our findings provide key insights into the atomic configurations of modified divacancies in 4H-SiC.

TL;DR: Recursive CliNR reduces logical errors in large Clifford circuits with small overhead, showing promise for near-term quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reducing logical error rates in Clifford circuits with minimal qubit and gate overhead, especially for larger circuits where the original CliNR may not suffice.

Method: The paper proposes a recursive version of Clifford noise reduction (CliNR) that reduces errors on larger circuits with small gate overhead. It requires (2⌈log(sp)⌉+3)n+1 qubits and at most 24s⌈(sp)^4⌉ gates.

Result: Numerical simulations show that recursive CliNR can achieve a lower logical error rate than the original CliNR with the same gate overhead when circuit sizes are large enough.

Conclusion: The recursive CliNR method demonstrates promise for reducing logical errors in large Clifford circuits with relatively small overheads, offering advantages in near-term quantum computing scenarios.

Abstract: Clifford noise reduction (CliNR) is a partial error correction scheme that reduces the logical error rate of Clifford circuits at the cost of a modest qubit and gate overhead. The CliNR implementation of an $n$-qubit Clifford circuit of size $s$ achieves a vanishing logical error rate if $snp^2\rightarrow 0$ where $p$ is the physical error rate. Here, we propose a recursive version of CliNR that can reduce errors on larger circuits with a relatively small gate overhead. When $np \rightarrow 0$, the logical error rate can be vanishingly small. This implementation requires $\left(2\left\lceil \log(sp)\right\rceil+3\right)n+1$ qubits and at most $24 s \left\lceil(sp)^4\right\rceil $ gates. Using numerical simulations, we show that the recursive method can offer an advantage in a realistic near-term parameter regime. When circuit sizes are large enough, recursive CliNR can reach a lower logical error rate than the original CliNR with the same gate overhead. The results offer promise for reducing logical errors in large Clifford circuits with relatively small overheads.

TL;DR: Entangled photons from para-positronium annihilation show enhanced azimuthal correlations in Compton scattering, requiring a modified cross section to unify quantum and classical descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the quantum entanglement effects in photon scattering and reconcile the differences between quantum and classical descriptions of such phenomena.

Method: The paper analyzes the Compton scattering of entangled photons using the Pryce-Ward cross section and compares it with the Klein-Nishina cross section for independent photons. It also introduces a modified cross section to bridge the two descriptions.

Result: Quantum entanglement increases azimuthal correlations in scattered photons. A modified cross section successfully reconciles Pryce-Ward and Klein-Nishina descriptions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that quantum entanglement in photons from para-positronium annihilation leads to measurable azimuthal correlations in Compton scattering, which cannot be explained by classical independent scattering. A modified scattering cross section can reconcile quantum and classical descriptions.

Abstract: Two photons from the ground state para-positronium annihilation are emitted in a maximally entangled singlet state of orthogonal polarizations. In case of the Compton scattering of both photons the phenomenon of quantum entanglement leads to a measurable increase in the azimuthal correlations of scattered photons, as opposed to a classical description treating the two scattering events as independent. The probability of the scattering of the system of the entangled photons is described by the Pryce-Ward cross section dependent on a difference of the azimuthal scattering angles in the fixed coordinate frame, while the independent scattering of single photons is described by the Klein-Nishina cross section dependent on the azimuthal angle relative to each photon's initial polarization. Since the singlet state of orthogonal polarizations is rotationally invariant, it does not carry any physical information on the initial polarizations of the single annihilation photons. In such bipartite state the angular origin for the Klein-Nishina cross section is undefined, making the Pryce-Ward and Klein-Nishina descriptions mutually exclusive. However, semi-classical simulations of the joint Compton scattering of entangled photons - implementing the Pryce-Ward cross section, but still treating the two photons as separate entities - can reconcile the Pryce-Ward correlations with the Klein-Nishina statistics for single photons by implementing a modified version of a scattering cross section presented in this work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend classical granular computing (fuzzy, rough, and shadowed granules) to the quantum regime, providing a common language for sharp and soft granules within the standard formalism of quantum information theory.

Method: The paper models quantum granules as effects on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, using Born probabilities for granular memberships. It explores foundational properties like normalization, monotonicity, and Boolean islands, and integrates granular refinement under Luders updates and quantum channels.

Result: The framework connects QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory, introducing Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with architectures for defining, learning, and integrating quantum granules with classical components. Case studies demonstrate practical applications in qubit granulation and Helstrom-style soft decisions.

Conclusion: The paper establishes Quantum Granular Computing (QGC) as a unified and mathematically grounded framework for operator-valued granules in quantum information processing, granular reasoning, and intelligent systems, with potential applications in near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: This paper develops the foundations of Quantum Granular Computing (QGC), extending classical granular computing including fuzzy, rough, and shadowed granules to the quantum regime. Quantum granules are modeled as effects on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, so granular memberships are given by Born probabilities. This operator theoretic viewpoint provides a common language for sharp (projective) and soft (nonprojective) granules and embeds granulation directly into the standard formalism of quantum information theory. We establish foundational results for effect based quantum granules, including normalization and monotonicity properties, the emergence of Boolean islands from commuting families, granular refinement under Luders updates, and the evolution of granules under quantum channels via the adjoint channel in the Heisenberg picture. We connect QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory by interpreting the effect operators realizing Helstrom minimum error measurement for binary state discrimination as Helstrom type decision granules, i.e., soft quantum counterparts of Bayes optimal decision regions. Building on these results, we introduce Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with three reference architectures that specify how quantum granules can be defined, learned, and integrated with classical components while remaining compatible with near term quantum hardware. Case studies on qubit granulation, two qubit parity effects, and Helstrom style soft decisions illustrate how QGC reproduces fuzzy like graded memberships and smooth decision boundaries while exploiting noncommutativity, contextuality, and entanglement. The framework thus provides a unified and mathematically grounded basis for operator valued granules in quantum information processing, granular reasoning, and intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 通过整合Chailloux和Tillich的强大软解码器到OPI框架中，我们提出了改进的算法，简化了分析并扩展了量子算法在编码和格问题中的应用范围。

Abstract: In recent years, a particularly interesting line of research has focused on designing quantum algorithms for code and lattice problems inspired by Regev's reduction. The core idea is to use a decoder for a given code to find short codewords in its dual. For example, Jordan et al. demonstrated how structured codes can be used in this framework to exhibit some quantum advantage. In particular, they showed how the classical decodability of Reed-Solomon codes can be leveraged to solve the Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI) problem quantumly. This approach was further improved by Chailloux and Tillich using stronger soft decoders, though their analysis was restricted to a specific setting of OPI. In this work, we reconcile these two approaches. We build on a recent formulation of the reduction by Chailloux and Hermouet in the lattice-based setting, which we rewrite in the language of codes. With this reduction, we show that the results of Jordan et al. can be recovered under Bernoulli noise models, simplifying the analysis. This characterization then allows us to integrate the stronger soft decoders of Chailloux and Tillich into the OPI framework, yielding improved algorithms.

Motivation: Current single-agent reinforcement learning approaches for QAS suffer from poor scalability with increasing qubit numbers due to the expanding action space and computational costs.

Method: A novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm was developed for Quantum Architecture Search (QAS), where each agent independently operates on a specific block of a quantum circuit.

Result: The algorithm was benchmarked on the MaxCut problem for 3-regular graphs and ground energy estimation for the Schwinger Hamiltonian, showing promising performance.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-agent RL algorithm for QAS demonstrates significant improvements in convergence speed and computational cost reduction, making it suitable for implementation on modern intermediate-scale quantum devices.

Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates the design of parameterized quantum circuits for variational quantum algorithms. The framework finds a well-suited problem-specific structure of a variational ansatz. Among possible implementations of QAS the reinforcement learning (RL) stands out as one of the most promising. Current RL approaches are single-agent-based and show poor scalability with a number of qubits due to the increase of the action space dimension and the computational cost. We propose a novel multi-agent RL algorithm for QAS with each agent acting separately on its own block of a quantum circuit. This procedure allows to significantly accelerate the convergence of the RL-based QAS and reduce its computational cost. We benchmark the proposed algorithm on MaxCut problem on 3-regular graphs and on ground energy estimation for the Schwinger Hamiltonian. In addition, the proposed multi-agent approach naturally fits into the set-up of distributed quantum computing, favoring its implementation on modern intermediate scale quantum devices.

Abstract: Qubit reuse offers a promising way to reduce the hardware demands of quantum circuits, but current approaches are largely restricted to reordering measurements and applying qubit resets. In this work, we present an approach to further optimize quantum circuits by fully utilizing the potential of dynamic quantum circuits-more precisely by moving measurements and introducing dynamic circuit primitives such as classically controlled gates in a way that forges entirely new pathways for qubit reuse. This significantly reduces the number of required qubits for a variety of circuits, creating new opportunities for running complex circuits on near-term devices with limited qubit counts. We show that the proposed approach drastically outperforms existing methods, reducing qubit requirements where previous approaches are unable to do so for popular quantum circuits such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Quantum Fourier Transform~(QFT), and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) ansätze, as well as leading to improvements of up to 95% for sparse random circuits.

Motivation: To explore the potential advantages of high-frequency cavities in cQED beyond the conventional 7 GHz range, while maintaining the functionality of superconducting qubits.

Method: The implementation involves coupling a regular transmon qubit (5 GHz) to a high-frequency cavity (21 GHz) and measuring key performance metrics such as dispersive shift, quantum efficiency, and qubit coherence times.

Result: Key results include a dispersive shift in the MHz range, 8% quantum efficiency, qubit energy relaxation quality factor over 10^7, coherence times exceeding 100 μs (up to 300 μs with echoing), and low readout and state assignment errors.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of using high-frequency cavities (21 GHz) in cQED without compromising the functionality of the qubit, encouraging further exploration of this approach.

Abstract: The basic element of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) is a cavity resonator strongly coupled to a superconducting qubit. Since the inception of the field, the choice of the cavity frequency was, with a few exceptions, been limited to a narrow range around 7 GHz due to a variety of fundamental and practical considerations. Here we report the first cQED implementation, where the qubit remains a regular transmon at about 5 GHz frequency, but the cavity's fundamental mode raises to 21 GHz. We demonstrate that (i) the dispersive shift remains in the conventional MHz range despite the large qubit-cavity detuning, (ii) the quantum efficiency of the qubit readout reaches 8%, (iii) the qubit's energy relaxation quality factor exceeds $10^7$, (iv) the qubit coherence time reproducibly exceeds $100~μ\rm{s}$ and can reach above $300~μ\rm{s}$ with a single echoing $π$-pulse correction. The readout error is currently limited by an accidental resonant excitation of a non-computational state, the elimination of which requires minor adjustments to the device parameters. Nevertheless, we were able to initialize the qubit in a repeated measurement by post-selection with $2\times 10^{-3}$ error and achieve $4\times 10^{-3}$ state assignment error. These results encourage in-depth explorations of potentially transformative advantages of high-frequency cavities without compromising existing qubit functionality.

Motivation: To experimentally distinguish between causal and informational coherence hypotheses in quantum mechanics using a delayed-choice setup.

Method: A multimode quantum memory is used to introduce a controlled delay, and electronic single-photon interference detection is employed for statistical discrimination.

Result: Direct statistical discrimination between the hypotheses is achieved using marginal detection statistics.

Conclusion: The experiment successfully implements a genuine delayed-choice quantum-erasure scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of testing causal vs. informational coherence hypotheses without post-selection.

Abstract: We propose an operationally well-defined delayed-choice quantum-erasure experiment that realizes, for the first time, a genuine delayed choice within presently available quantum-optical technology. A multimode quantum memory supplies a controlled and verifiable delay, ensuring that the choice operation is applied strictly after the observation event. Electronic single-photon interference detection measurements then furnish a direct statistical discriminator between the causal and informational coherence hypotheses, based solely on marginal detection statistics and without any post-selection. The Poissonian structure of the detection statistics allows accumulation of statistics across repeated operational units, rendering the proposal practical and experimentally feasible.

Motivation: To achieve ultrahigh nonreciprocal transmission in optical systems by leveraging the Sagnac effect and squeezing techniques.

Method: The study utilizes a cavity-magnon system with two whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and a single magnon mode within a yttrium iron garnet sphere, employing the Sagnac effect to achieve nonreciprocal frequency shift.

Result: An optical isolation ratio exceeding 40 dB, the highest reported to date, with directionality reversible by modifying the WGM cavity rotation.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the potential for developing high-performance, tunable, and compact optical nonreciprocal devices.

Abstract: Ultrahigh nonreciprocal transmission has been achieved in a cavity-magnon system, which consists of two whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and a single magnon mode within a magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet sphere. The nonreciprocal frequency shift induced by the Sagnac effect enables unidirectional transmission of an input field, while suppressing propagation in the opposite direction, thereby facilitating nonreciprocal optical transmission. Within experimentally accessible parameter regimes, the optical isolation ratio can exceed 40 dB, representing the highest isolation ratio reported to date. Furthermore, applying squeezing to the magnon mode further enhances this isolation performance. Additionally, the directionality of light isolation can be reversed simply by modifying the rotation of the WGM cavity. These findings offer promising prospects for developing high-performance, tunable, and compact optical nonreciprocal devices.

Motivation: The research aims to achieve precise control of photon transport in waveguide quantum electrodynamics to advance quantum information processing.

Method: The study uses the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism to derive the scattering matrix and examines both single- and multi-mode regimes. It investigates control mechanisms like Fano resonances and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT).

Result: In the single-mode regime, external drive parameters precisely tune reflection peaks. In the multi-mode regime, quantum interference governs dynamics, with coherent inputs restoring single-mode-like behavior.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a versatile toolbox for photonic quantum control in multi-mode waveguides, enabling applications like broadband dual-frequency filters and multi-mode spectrometers.

Abstract: Precise control of photon transport in waveguide quantum electrodynamics is fundamental to advancing quantum information processing. We investigate the manipulation of single-photon scattering via a driven $Λ$-type emitter coupled to a rectangular waveguide, examining both single- and multi-mode regimes. Using the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism, we derive the scattering matrix and identify two distinct control mechanisms: Fano resonances induce complete reflection, and electromagnetically induce transparency (EIT) induce perfect transmission. In the single-mode regime, the external drive parameters-the detuning and Rabi frequency-precisely tune the positions and number of reflection peaks, allowing dynamic spectral engineering. In the multi-mode regime, quantum interference between modes governs the scattering dynamics. When the input photon is prepared in a specific coherent superposition, multi-mode effects restore single-mode-like behavior, enabling Fano-mediated complete reflection. Conversely, a single-mode input prevents complete reflection even at the Fano resonance, while EIT-driven transmission persists. These results demonstrate a versatile toolbox for photonic quantum control in multi-mode waveguides, paving the way for applications such as broadband dual-frequency filters and multi-mode spectrometers.

Abstract: Cloud-based quantum computing, coupled with the rapid progress in quantum algorithms, brings to the forefront the question of verifiability in delegated quantum computations. In the current landscape of noisy quantum devices, this question must be addressed alongside noise tolerance. In this work, we revisit the circuit-based framework for verifiable quantum computation introduced by Broadbent [Theory of Computing, 2018], and extend it to the setting of server-side noise. Our contribution is an improved upper bound on the noise-tolerance threshold, achieved through a protocol that interleaves computation and test rounds in an indistinguishable manner. This structure enables a concise security proof against arbitrary deviations by the server, while ensuring robustness to realistic noise.

Conclusion: 通过引入负学习率的方法，本文成功解决了VQA在资源受限的QIoT设备上遇到的贫瘠平台问题，为量子-经典混合模型的鲁棒优化提供了新途径。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are becoming the primary computational primitive for next-generation quantum computers, particularly those embedded as resource-constrained accelerators in the emerging Quantum Internet of Things (QIoT). However, under such device-constrained execution conditions, the scalability of learning is severely limited by barren plateaus, where gradients collapse to zero and training stalls. This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers. By escaping barren plateaus, our approach leads to a novel pathway for robust optimization in quantum-classical hybrid models.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that wave-particle duality in induced coherence is constrained by measurement optimality, not geometry, through quantum-state discrimination, with potential for enhanced imaging and sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a direct operational interpretation of wave-particle complementarity in induced-coherence interferometry and explore its implications beyond geometric constraints.

Method: The study links interference visibility to the optimal performance of unambiguous quantum-state discrimination, specifically using the Ivanovic-Dieks-Peres (IDP) strategy in a Zou-Wang-Mandel interferometer setup.

Result: The single-photon visibility equals the minimal inconclusive probability of the optimal IDP strategy (V = P_I^{opt}), and the complementarity relation D^{2} + V^{2} = 1 is shown to represent a measurement-optimality boundary. In the presence of thermal noise, a hierarchy linking visibility, fidelity, and optimal discrimination is derived.

Conclusion: Wave-particle duality in induced coherence is fundamentally limited by measurement optimality rather than interferometer geometry, with potential applications in discrimination-enhanced imaging and sensing.

Abstract: We establish a direct operational interpretation of wave-particle complementarity in induced-coherence interferometry by linking interference visibility to the optimal performance of unambiguous quantum-state discrimination. In the low-gain Zou-Wang-Mandel interferometer, the idler modes of the two SPDC crystals act as nonorthogonal which-crystal marker states, and we show that the single-photon visibility equals the minimal inconclusive probability of the optimal Ivanovic-Dieks-Peres (IDP) strategy, V = P_I^{opt}, so that the complementarity relation D^{2} + V^{2} = 1 expresses a measurement-optimality boundary rather than a geometric constraint. Our results reveal that wave-particle duality in induced coherence is not limited by interferometer geometry but by measurement optimality in zero-error discrimination on the idler, with experimentally testable consequences predicting distinguishability beyond that inferred from visibility alone. In the presence of thermal noise we derive the hierarchy V <= F(rho_A, rho_B) <= P_I^{opt}, linking visibility, fidelity, and optimal discrimination. These results identify distinguishability as fundamentally measurement-limited and motivate discrimination-enhanced induced-coherence imaging and sensing.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum phases-of-matter at finite-temperature is essential for understanding complex materials and large-scale thermodynamic phenomena. Here, we develop algorithmic protocols for simulating quantum thermodynamics on quantum hardware through quantum kernel function expansion (QKFE), producing the free energy as an analytic function of temperature with uniform convergence.

In both analogue and digital implementations of the QKFE algorithms, we exhibit quantitative agreement of our quantum simulation experiments with the exact results. Our approach provides a general framework for computing thermodynamic potentials on programmable quantum devices, granting access to key thermodynamic properties such as entropy, heat capacity and criticality, with far-reaching implications for material design and drug development.

Conclusion: The 4K heat-insulated high-speed, low-power optical transceiver successfully establishes a complete link between 4K systems and room-temperature equipment, demonstrating its potential for scalable quantum computing and cryogenic computing systems.

Abstract: Cryogenic systems necessitate extensive data transmission between room-temperature and cryogenic environments, as well as within the cryogenic temperature domain. High-speed, low-power data transmission is pivotal to enabling the deployment of larger-scale cryogenic systems, including the scalable quantum computing systems and the high-performance cryogenic computing systems fully immersed in liquid nitrogen. In contrast to wireline and microwave links, optical communication links are emerging as a solution characterized by high data rates, high energy efficiency, low signal attenuation, absence of thermal conduction, and superior scalability. In this work, a 4K heat-insulated high-speed (56Gbps) low-power (1.6pJ/b) transceiver (TRX) that achieves a complete link between 4K systems and room temperature (RT) equipment is presented. Copackaged with a PIN photodiode (PD), the RX uses an inverter-based analog front-end and an analog half-rate clock data recovery loop. Connecting to a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), the TX contains a voltage-mode driver with current-mode injection for low-power output-swing-boosting and 3-tap feed-forward equalization (FFE). This link has been demonstrated in the control and readout of a complete superconducting quantum computing system.

Motivation: To address the limitations posed by noise in neutral atom-based quantum computation and provide systematic benchmarks for evaluating and comparing quantum processors as they scale up.

Method: The study employs the quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to solve maximal independent set (MIS) instances on random unit-disk graphs, providing scalable benchmarks without requiring prior knowledge of system evolution.

Result: quera_aquila showed better performance compared to pasqal_fresnel on both QAOA and QAA instances for problem sizes up to 102 and 85 qubits, respectively. The benchmarks were successfully extended to 1000 qubits.

Conclusion: The study presents scalable benchmarks for neutral atom-based quantum processors, demonstrating that quera_aquila outperforms pasqal_fresnel in both QAOA and QAA instances. The benchmarks are adaptable for future larger processors up to 1000 qubits.

Abstract: In recent years, neutral atom-based quantum computation has been established as a competing alternative for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, as with other quantum technologies, various sources of noise limit their performance. With processors continuing to scale up, new techniques are needed to characterize and compare them in order to track their progress. In this work, we present two systematic benchmarks that evaluate these quantum processors at scale. We use the quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to solve maximal independent set (MIS) instances of random unit-disk graphs. These benchmarks are scalable, relying not on prior knowledge of the system's evolution but on the quality of the MIS solutions obtained. We benchmark quera_aquila and pasqal_fresnel on problem sizes up to 102 and 85 qubits, respectively. Overall, quera_aquila performs better on QAOA and QAA instances. Finally, we generate MIS instances of up to 1000 qubits, providing scalable benchmarks for evaluating future, larger processors as they become available.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper connects quantum relative entropy and classical KL divergences, showing minimal divergence occurs on a common basis between states, and links it to Belavkin-Staszewski entropy, with applications in Lindblad flow and large deviation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to define a notion of quantum relative entropy for pure state distributions, which arise from unravelings of the Lindblad equation, such as the stochastic Schrödinger equation. This aims to bridge classical and quantum information theory.

Method: The method involves analyzing the quantum relative entropy of faithful states and its relation to classical Kullback-Leibler divergences of measures on pure state distributions. The classical and quantum data-processing inequalities are employed to demonstrate the equivalence with the Belavkin-Staszewski entropy.

Result: The results show that the minimal KL divergence is achieved by measures supported on a common basis between the quantum states. The equivalence with the Belavkin-Staszewski entropy is demonstrated, and new insights into relative entropy contraction under Lindblad flow are provided.

Conclusion: The study establishes a connection between quantum relative entropy and classical Kullback-Leibler divergences, showing that the measures minimizing KL divergence are supported on a common basis between the quantum states. The findings reveal new insights into the Belavkin-Staszewski entropy and provide a novel proof for the contraction of relative entropy under Lindblad flow.

Abstract: This work explores connections between the quantum relative entropy of two faithful states $ρ,σ$ (i.e. full-rank density matrices) and the Kullback-Leibler divergences of classical measures $μ,ν$. Here, $μ$ and $ν$ are measures on the space of pure states, realizing $ρ$ and $σ$ respectively. The motivation for this result is to establish a notion of quantum relative entropy in the space of pure state distributions, which are the resulting objects of unravelings of the Lindblad equation, such as the stochastic Schrödinger equation. Our results show that the measures that achieve the minimal KL divergence are those supported on a (possibly non-orthogonal) common basis between $ρ$ and $σ$. Using the classical and quantum data-processing inequalities, our notion of quantum relative entropy is shown to be equivalent to the Belavkin-Staszewski entropy on states, revealing new insights on this quantity. Furthermore, the common basis is used to provide a novel proof of contraction of the relative entropy under Lindblad flow and offers insights into results from large deviation theory.

### [71] [Secret Entanglement, Public Geometry. Quantum Cryptography from a Geometric Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22984)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A geometric approach to quantum cryptography hides secrets in state movement dynamics using entanglement foliations and unitary trajectories, formalized as geometric entanglement codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores whether quantum cryptography could rely on the dynamics of state movement through Hilbert space rather than static state preparation, aiming to enhance security through geometric properties.

Method: The method involves using the Fubini-Study metric on pure state manifolds, a family of entanglement measures, and controlled unitary operations to generate trajectories. The secrecy is encoded in the choice of a parameter θ that defines the entanglement functional and foliation.

Result: The authors formalize geometric entanglement codes and demonstrate their feasibility with toy constructions, showing how incompatible foliations can function analogously to mutually unbiased bases.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a novel geometric perspective on quantum cryptography, leveraging the Hilbert space's geometric structure to hide secrets in state movements rather than state preparation. This approach introduces geometric entanglement codes with practical potential for secure communication.

Abstract: Can a secret be hidden not in which quantum state is prepared, but in the way that state \emph{moves} through its space of possibilities? Motivated by this question, we propose an essential geometric perspective on quantum cryptography in which projective Hilbert space and its entanglement foliations play a central role. The basic ingredients are: (a) the Fubini-Study metric on the manifold of pure states, (b) a family of entanglement measures viewed as scalar functions on this manifold, and (c) controlled trajectories generated by unitary operations.
  The geometric structure -- state manifold, metric, and allowed moves -- is fully public, as is the functional form of the entanglement family. What remains secret is the choice of parameter $θ$ that selects a specific entanglement functional $E_θ$ and the corresponding foliation into constant-entanglement hypersurfaces. In this setting, classical messages are encoded not only in the sequence of states but also in the pattern of upward, downward, or tangential steps with respect to the hidden foliation. We formalize this idea in terms of geometric entanglement codes and illustrate it with two toy constructions in which incompatible foliations play the role of mutually unbiased bases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for characterizing quantum states are impractical or computationally demanding.

Method: Developed a convex resource-theoretic framework using norms of linear functionals to quantify quantumness without optimization.

Result: A no-go theorem shows no universal measure of quantumness exists without optimization, supported by Gaussian and non-Gaussian state examples.

Conclusion: Quantumness can be quantified without optimization, but no universal measure exists without it, as proven theoretically and demonstrated with examples.

Abstract: Despite several approaches proposed to operationally characterize quantum states of light-those that cannot be sampled with a positive distribution over classical states-most existing formulations suffer from limited practicality or rely on convex optimization procedures that are computationally demanding. In this work, we develop a general convex resource-theoretic framework to quantify optical quantumness directly from the norms of linear functionals of quantum states, thereby avoiding any optimization. We further establish a no-go theorem demonstrating that no universal measure of quantumness can exist in the absence of optimization. Finally, we substantiate our theoretical result through explicit examples involving both Gaussian and non-Gaussian states.

Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays offer a powerful platform for engineering cooperative light-matter interactions and enabling quantum metasurfaces. We demonstrate that a two-dimensional array of three-level atoms operating under electromagnetically induced transparency can function as a tunable dual-band atomic mirror, where two independently controllable reflection bands emerge from the collective optical responses mediated by dipole-dipole interactions. These resonances yield dual reflection bands with asymmetric linewidths, whose spectral positions and bandwidths can be tuned through the control-field parameters, dipole orientation, incident geometry, and lattice constant. We further identify the conditions under which additional diffraction orders emerge, which delineate the operational and tunable range of the atomic mirror via its collective-mode structure. This scheme provides a fully tunable dual-band atomic mirror operating across broad frequency and angular ranges, offering a practical and experimentally accessible pathway toward reconfigurable photonic elements in atomic-array platforms at low energy levels.

Abstract: Bosonic modes provide a promising platform for quantum batteries as a result of their unbounded energy spectrum. However, the energy that can be stored during a coherent charging process is limited due to coherent oscillations between the charger and battery. In this Letter, we show that by introducing a slow quench in the interaction between a coherently driven quadratic oscillator battery and a charger system, the maximum battery power ($P_{B,m}$) scales algebraically with the quench duration ($τ_Q$), i.e., $P_{B,m} \propto τ_Q^α$, where $0<α\leq2$ is a function of the quench ramp exponent. This finding implies that, counterintuitively, slower quenches lead to faster charging. Such a quench suppresses coherent energy oscillations between the battery and the charger, allowing an unbounded increase in power. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of charger dissipation, which imposes a finite limit on the maximum power. We also show that the temporal extensive scaling occurs in a broader context by mapping the system to a coherently driven Tavis-Cummings battery.

Abstract: The computational cost of simulating quantum many-body systems can often be reduced by taking advantage of physical symmetries. While methods exist for specific symmetry classes, a general algorithm to find the full permutation symmetry group of an arbitrary Pauli Hamiltonian is notably lacking. This paper introduces a new method that identifies this symmetry group by establishing an isomorphism between the Hamiltonian's permutation symmetry group and the automorphism group of a coloured bipartite graph constructed from the Hamiltonian. We formally prove this isomorphism and show that for physical Hamiltonians with bounded locality and interaction degree, the resulting graph has a bounded degree, reducing the computational problem of finding the automorphism group to polynomial time. The algorithm's validity is empirically confirmed on various physical models with known symmetries. We further show that the problem of deciding whether two Hamiltonians are permutation-equivalent is polynomial-time reducible to the graph isomorphism problem using our graph representation. This work provides a general, structurally exact tool for algorithmic symmetry finding, enabling the scalable application of these symmetries to Hamiltonian simulation problems.

Motivation: The motivation is to provide a precise physical description and understanding of the classical dual content of quantum theory, which is essential for fields like quantum technologies and computation.

Method: The authors investigated Quantum Entanglement using the APL Quantum 2, 016104 (2025) approach on dual Classicalization. They analyzed the entanglement for coherent states (coset and non-coset) and topologies (circle and cylinder) by projecting wave functions onto irreducible Hilbert Mp(n) subspaces and computing entanglement probabilities.

Result: The results include the computation and analysis of entanglement for various states and topologies, specifically the entanglement probabilities (P++, P--, P+-) and their total sum, demonstrating the role of the Metaplectic group Mp(n) in Classicalization.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that Classicalization in quantum theory is deeply linked to the Metaplectic group Mp(n), and the study of entanglement with APL Quantum 2's new approach provides insights into the dual Classicalization process. The results have potential experimental and practical applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: A precise physical description and understanding of the classical dual content of quantum theory is necessary in many disciplines today: from concepts and interpretation to quantum technologies and computation. In this paper we investigate Quantum Entanglement with the new approach APL Quantum 2, 016104 (2025) on dual Classicalization. Thus, the results of this paper are twofold: Entanglement and Classicalization and the relationship between them. Classicalization truly occurs only under the action of the Metaplectic group Mp(n) (Minimal Representation group, double covering of the Symplectic group). Some of the results of this paper involves the computation and analysis of the entanglement for different types of coherent (coset and non coset) states and topologies: in the circle and the cylinder. We project the entangled wave functions onto the even (+) and odd (-) irreducible Hilbert Mp(n) subspaces, and compute their square norms: Entanglement Probabilities P++, P--, P+-, (eg in the same or in the different subspaces), and the Total sum of them, and more. These theoretical and conceptual results can be of experimental and practical real-world interest.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational prohibitions of classical methods for high-dimensional data in topological data analysis (TDA), and to explore the potential of quantum hardware in this context.

Method: The paper reinterprets time-domain dynamics through the eigenvalue spectrum of a supersymmetric Hamiltonian and uses quantum spectroscopy to estimate topological descriptors, implemented on IBM quantum hardware.

Result: The spectral gap of the SUSY Laplacian tracks the persistence of homological structures; its minimum coincides with the onset of chaos, and its reopening reflects the geometric maturation of the attractor.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that quantum hardware can serve as a spectrometer for data topologies, offering an exponential advantage over classical methods, and validating the framework on small complexes.

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) characterizes complex dynamics through global invariants, but classical computation becomes prohibitive for high-dimensional data. We reinterpret time-domain dynamics as the eigenvalue spectrum of a supersymmetric (SUSY) Hamiltonian and thereby estimate topological descriptors through quantum spectroscopy. While zero modes correspond to Betti numbers, we show that low-lying excited states quantify the stability of topological features. Using a Takens embedding of the Lorenz system together with a resource-efficient quantum phase estimation implemented on IBM quantum hardware, we observe that the spectral gap of the SUSY Laplacian tracks the persistence of homological structures. Notably, the minimum of this spectral gap coincides with the onset of chaos, whereas its reopening reflects the geometric maturation of the attractor. Validated on small complexes yet offering an exponential advantage over classical diagonalization (from $O(N^3)$ to $\mathrm{poly}(\log N)$), this framework suggests that quantum hardware can function as a spectrometer for data topologies beyond classical reach.

Motivation: Nonstabilizerness is crucial for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimation is valuable for practical applications.

Method: Supervised learning with GNNs, addressing classification and regression tasks for stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) estimation.

Result: The GNN captures meaningful features from graph-based circuit representations, improving SRE estimation on diverse circuits.

Conclusion: The GNN approach effectively estimates nonstabilizerness in quantum circuits, demonstrating robust generalization across various tasks and scenarios, including noisy quantum hardware.

Abstract: This article proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to estimate nonstabilizerness in quantum circuits, measured by the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimations are highly beneficial in practical applications. We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model. Moreover, the graph representation of quantum circuits naturally integrates hardware-specific information. Simulations on noisy quantum hardware highlight the potential of the proposed GNN to predict the SRE measured on quantum devices.

*Ole Sönnerborn*

TL;DR: The paper characterizes quantum states saturating the Margolus-Levitin speed limit, focusing on mixed states and qubit systems, and extends the results to dual speed limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and characterize the structural properties of quantum states that achieve the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit, particularly for mixed states, and to extend these insights to qubit systems and dual speed limits.

Method: The paper employs a purification-based approach to analyze the structural criteria for saturation of the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit, including constraints on state support, eigenvector superpositions, and orthogonal evolution subspaces.

Result: The research identifies strict criteria for state saturation, including a rank bound that excludes faithful states. It also derives a tight purity-resolved bound for qubits and extends the dual speed limit to mixed states.

Conclusion: The study provides a complete characterization of quantum states that saturate the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit, including mixed states. It derives a purity-resolved bound for qubit systems and extends the dual speed limit to mixed states with corresponding saturation conditions.

Abstract: We provide a complete characterization of all finite-dimensional quantum states that saturate the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit at arbitrary Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity. Employing a purification-based approach, we prove that mixed-state saturation occurs precisely when three structural criteria are fulfilled: the state's support is confined to the sum of two energy eigenspaces (the ground level and a single excited level); each eigenvector of the state with nonzero weight is a fixed superposition of one ground- and one excited-state energy eigenvector (determined by the minimizer of the objective function identified by Giovannetti et al.) and all such eigenvectors evolve in mutually orthogonal two-dimensional subspaces. These requirements impose a strict rank bound, ruling out saturation by any faithful state. For qubit systems, we derive a purity-resolved and tight Margolus-Levitin bound that reduces to the pure-state result in the limit of unit purity. Through a time-reversal argument, we further extend the dual Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit to mixed states and establish the corresponding saturation conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for theoretical advancements in detecting genuine entanglement of large-scale continuous variable systems, given the limitations in existing experimental approaches.

Method: Based on uncertainty relations and the sign matrix technique, the framework provides matrix criteria for detecting entanglement depth and k-separability in multimode systems.

Result: Demonstration of the framework's applicability to various entanglement scenarios, including systems with over a hundred million modes in noisy environments.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a general and efficient framework for detecting genuine entanglement in continuous variable multipartite systems, which is validated through examples like Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states under photon loss and noise.

Abstract: Genuine entanglement identification of large scale systems is crucial for quantum computation, quantum communication and quantum learning advantage. In contrast to experiments, where noisy intermediate-scale programmable photonic quantum processors have been developed, theoretically very limited results have been achieved for detecting genuine entanglement of continuous variable multipartite systems. We propose a quite general and efficient entanglement detection framework for all kinds of multipartite entanglement of continuous variable systems based on uncertainty relations and the sign matrix technique. Matrix criteria are demonstrated and can be applied to various entanglement depth and k-separability problems of multimode systems. We illustrate the genuine entanglement conditions of continuous variable Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states of more than a hundred million modes in a photon loss and noise environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate the feasibility of high-performance time synchronization over long distances, particularly in scenarios without intermediate amplification (e.g., long-haul underwater fibre), for applications like quantum communication systems.

Method: The deployment involved careful selection and optimization of components at the link's end points, using standard telecom fibre and off-the-shelf hardware.

Result: Successful time synchronization over 300 km with 99.86% uptime, maintaining picosecond-level precision and sub-nanosecond accuracy.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the longest unrepeated deployment of White Rabbit technology, achieving sub-nanosecond accuracy and picosecond-level precision over a 300 km single-span optical fibre link, with high uptime (99.86%). The results pave the way for scalable and standardised timing backbones in large-scale quantum networks.

Abstract: White Rabbit (WR) technology provides a commercially-available off-the-shelf solution for time synchronisation with sub-nanosecond accuracy and picosecond-level precision over optical fibre links typically spanning tens of kilometres. Such high-performance time dissemination can support a variety of applications, including position, navigation and timing (PNT), financial transactions, metrology, as well as entanglement and quantum key distribution (QKD). Demonstrations of WR over significantly longer distances remain few and far between, particularly in scenarios where intermediate amplification is unavailable, such as stretches of long-haul underwater fibre. In this work, we report the longest unrepeated deployment of WR to date, achieving time synchronisation over a 300 km (51.34 dB) single-span optical fibre link, even in highly asymmetrical configurations, with 99.86% uptime, whilst maintaining picosecond-level precision and sub-nanosecond accuracy. This was achieved through careful selection and optimisation of the components deployed at the link's end points. By leveraging standard telecom fibre and off-the-shelf hardware, our results pave the way for a scalable and standardised timing backbone for large-scale quantum networks, offering a practical route toward time distribution in future heterogeneous quantum communication systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for hardware-efficient quantum error correction by utilizing the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators, with a focus on geometric arrangements of quantum states in phase space.

Method: QCCs are constructed using cubature formulas from multivariate approximation theory, linking the continuous geometry of phase space to discrete, weighted point sets. This includes non-uniform superpositions and multi-shell configurations, with numerical simulations validating the performance.

Result: QCCs generalize well-known codes like cat codes and quantum spherical codes, revealing them as specific instances. Multi-shell QCCs outperform single-shell codes in numerical simulations under a pure-loss channel.

Conclusion: The Quantum Cubature Codes (QCCs) framework provides a generalized and powerful approach to constructing bosonic codes, demonstrating superior performance under photon loss and revealing a vast new design space for quantum error correction.

Abstract: Bosonic codes utilize the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators to encode quantum information, offering a hardware-efficient approach to quantum error correction. Designing these codes requires precise geometric arrangements of quantum states in the phase space. Here, we introduce Quantum Cubature Codes (QCCs), a powerful and generalized framework for constructing bosonic codes based on superpositions of coherent states. This formalism utilizes cubature formulas from multivariate approximation theory, which connect the continuous geometry of the phase space to discrete, weighted point sets, ensuring the conditions for error correction are met. We demonstrate that this framework provides a unifying perspective, revealing that well-established codes, such as cat codes and the recently proposed quantum spherical codes (QSCs), are specific instances of QCCs corresponding to uniform weights on a single energy shell. The QCC formalism unlocks a vast new design space, encompassing non-uniform superpositions and multi-shell configurations. We leverage this framework to discover several new families of codes derived from Euclidean designs, allowing for greater geometric separation between logical states, which correlates with improved performance under photon loss. Numerical simulations under a pure-loss channel show that our multi-shell QCCs can outperform their single-shell counterparts by maximizing geometric separation with optimal energy at fixed pure-loss rate.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analog Quantum Simulators lack quantitative error estimation, limiting their predictive power for strongly correlated many-body dynamics. Rigorous uncertainty bounds are needed to elevate them from qualitative demonstrations to quantitative scientific tools.

Method: The approach combines Hamiltonian and Lindbladian Learning for statistically rigorous inference of the system's dynamics, along with propagating uncertainties into simulated observables to derive confidence bounds from experimental data. Applied to trapped-ion quantum simulators with up to 51 ions.

Result: The learned models from experimental data reproduce the dynamics within predicted bounds, demonstrating quantitative reliability and consistency. Error bounds were validated both with and without classical simulation.

Abstract: Analog Quantum Simulators offer a route to exploring strongly correlated many-body dynamics beyond classical computation, but their predictive power remains limited by the absence of quantitative error estimation. Establishing rigorous uncertainty bounds is essential for elevating such devices from qualitative demonstrations to quantitative scientific tools. Here we introduce a general framework for bounded-error quantum simulation, which provides predictions for many-body observables with experimentally quantifiable uncertainties. The approach combines Hamiltonian and Lindbladian Learning--a statistically rigorous inference of the coherent and dissipative generators governing the dynamics--with the propagation of their uncertainties into the simulated observables, yielding confidence bounds directly derived from experimental data. We demonstrate this framework on trapped-ion quantum simulators implementing long-range Ising interactions with up to 51 ions, and validate it where classical comparison is possible. We analyze error bounds on two levels. First, we learn an open-system model from experimental data collected in an initial time window of quench dynamics, simulate the corresponding master equation, and quantitatively verify consistency between theoretical predictions and measured dynamics at long times. Second, we establish error bounds directly from experimental measurements alone, without relying on classical simulation--crucial for entering regimes of quantum advantage. The learned models reproduce the experimental evolution within the predicted bounds, demonstrating quantitative reliability and internal consistency. Bounded-error quantum simulation provides a scalable foundation for trusted analog quantum computation, bridging the gap between experimental platforms and predictive many-body physics. The techniques presented here directly extend to digital quantum simulation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the onset and mechanism of Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in a chain of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms subject to local dephasing.

Method: We demonstrate the emergence of HSF using a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes, identifying conserved quantities defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator.

Result: The number of fragmented Hilbert space subspaces grows exponentially with the chain length, following a modified Fibonacci sequence.

Conclusion: Our work provides insights into many-body dynamics under dynamical constraints and opens avenues for controlling and manipulating HSF in Rydberg atom systems.

Abstract: We investigate the onset and mechanism of Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in a chain of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms subject to local dephasing. It is found that the emergence of multiple long-lived metastable states is fundamentally tied to HSF of the driven-dephasing Rydberg atom system. We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator. Moreover, we show explicitly that the number of the fragmented Hilbert space grows exponentially with the chain length, following a modified Fibonacci sequence. Our work provides insights into many-body dynamics under dynamical constraints and opens avenues for controlling and manipulating HSF in Rydberg atom systems.

We find that amplitude damping redistributes coherence and population imbalance without violating complementarity, while phase damping reduces coherence but leaves predictability unchanged. These results demonstrate that the complementarity relation remains preserved even in open quantum systems, highlighting its robustness against decoherence and providing a unified analytical understanding of noisy quantum interferometry in low-dimensional systems.

Abstract: Modern precision measurements, such as interferometry for detecting gravitational waves, rely on the estimation of optical phases encoded in light fields. Here, we propose to exploit the collectively enhanced output field of a driven-dissipative many-body open quantum system as a light source in order to improve the precision of estimating optical phases. Pronounced temporal correlations of such output fields benefit the sensitivity of measurement protocols, which we show theoretically by employing a boundary time crystal as a light source. The fundamental bound on the precision of such estimation shows scaling with system size that surpasses the Heisenberg limit and obeys the standard quantum limit in the measurement time. This scaling can be partially harnessed by a protocol, in which the phase shifted light field is guided into an auxiliary replica system, which serves as a detector that is sensitive to non-trivial temporal correlations of the light.

TL;DR: A fidelity-based rescaling technique accelerates MPS simulations for non-integrable quantum systems, demonstrated on the 2D TFIM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical simulation of non-integrable Hamiltonian many-body quantum systems is resource-intensive, especially for intermediate energy densities. Existing methods struggle with efficiency, motivating the search for improved techniques.

Method: A heuristic approach rescales MPS results at low bond dimensions using a fidelity-dependent factor to estimate observables. The method was tested on the 2D Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM) with a maximum bond dimension of χ=4096 on a single A100 GPU.

Result: The heuristic method provides accelerated convergence for MPS simulations, validated by matching results from digital quantum processor simulations.

Conclusion: The proposed heuristic approach successfully accelerates the convergence of MPS simulations for expectation values across a wide range of energy densities, demonstrated by simulations of the 2D TFIM on a 7×8 grid with periodic boundary conditions.

Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of non-integrable Hamiltonian many-body quantum systems are characterized by highly entangled wave functions. Near-maximal entanglement arises in systems exhibiting thermalization or pre-thermalization, where the system converges to a steady state with a fixed energy density. Classical simulation of the time dependence of such wave functions requires exponential resources. However, typical computations aim to estimate expectation values of local operators and correlation functions to some expected precision. For thermalizing systems at sufficiently high energy densities, such computations do not require storing the full wave function. Nonetheless, constructing classical algorithms for intermediate energy densities has remained a challenge. In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach to accelerate the convergence of Matrix Product State (MPS) simulations of expectation values applicable in a broad range of energy densities. We estimate the desired observables by rescaling the MPS results at low bond dimensions with a factor that depends only on the fidelity of the MPS wave function. Using this technique, we simulated the dynamics of the two-dimensional Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM) on a $7\times8$ grid with periodic boundary conditions, using a maximum bond dimension of $χ= 4096$ on a single A100 GPU. We compared our results to similar TFIM simulations on a digital quantum processor.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of quantum polymorphisms to the complexity theory of non-local games. We use this notion to give a full characterisation of the existence of commutativity gadgets for relational structures, introduced by Ji as a method for achieving quantum soundness of classical CSP reductions. Prior to our work, a classification was only known in the Boolean case [Culf--Mastel, STOC'25].

Conclusion: 本文通过一种简洁的构造方法，展示了随机纯化通道的性质及其在非独立同分布状态下的应用，并扩展了量子分歧的Uhlmann定理。

Abstract: The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ i.i.d. copies of any mixed quantum state into a uniform convex combination of $n$ i.i.d. copies of its purifications, has proved to be an extremely useful tool in quantum learning theory. Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is crucial for modeling and controlling open quantum systems.

Method: The method utilizes the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator, obtained via the mHAVOK algorithm, to infer Hamiltonian parameters from first-moment dynamics.

Result: The method successfully retrieves key parameters (oscillation frequencies, damping rates, etc.) with errors mostly within 5% of true values, outperforming Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators in strongly dissipative dynamics.

Conclusion: Koopman operator theory offers a useful framework for studying quantum dynamical systems, as demonstrated by the accurate retrieval of Hamiltonian parameters.

Abstract: An accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and control of open quantum systems. In this work, a novel data-driven method for inferring such parameters from first-moment dynamics is presented using an open 2D quantum harmonic oscillator as an example. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain such parameters, which is obtained using the multichannel Hankel Alternative View of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm; a theoretical connection of such affirmation is presented. The method is tested on the expected value of noiseless quadratures, retrieving oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, qubit-photon coupling strengths of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and a modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5% of their true values. When compared to Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.

Abstract: We report two types of singularities that arise from fluctuations during the formation of charge- or spin-density waves. The first is the exceptional point (EP), corresponding to a higher-order pole of the retarded Green's function. Such EPs lead to algebraic corrections in the decay of quasiparticle occupations and are observable through time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES). The second is a spectral cusp, defined by the coalescence of three extrema in the real-frequency spectral function $A(\mathbf{k}, ω)$. This cusp enforces the formation of Fermi arcs and induces a "threading" structure in the nearby band structure, both of which are directly observable in ARPES.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the behavior of electrons in low-density insulating regimes, particularly the formation of a quantum electron solid, and compare it with known phenomena in type-II superconductors.

Method: The paper reviews transport experiments in 2D electron systems (silicon MOSFETs and SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures) and adapts the vortex lattice depinning model to explain the observed double-threshold voltage-current characteristics.

Result: Double-threshold voltage-current characteristics, resembling vortex lattice depinning in superconductors, were observed. The behavior changes under a perpendicular magnetic field, stabilizing the quantum electron solid. No similar behavior was found in the quantum Hall regime.

Conclusion: The study supports the formation of a quantum electron solid at low electron densities, with experimental results aligning with theoretical predictions under a perpendicular magnetic field. However, the absence of double-threshold behavior in the quantum Hall regime suggests no formation of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid.

Abstract: We review recent transport experiments that reveal two-threshold voltage-current characteristics, marked by a significant increase in noise between the two threshold voltages, at low electron densities in the insulating regime in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, specifically in silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures. The double-threshold voltage-current characteristics closely resemble those observed in the collective depinning of the vortex lattice in type-II superconductors. By adapting the model used for vortices to the case of an electron solid, good agreement with the experimental results is achieved, which supports a quantum electron solid forming in the low electron density state. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied, the double-threshold behavior occurs at voltages an order of magnitude lower and at significantly higher electron densities than the zero-field case. This indicates the stabilization of the quantum electron solid, aligning with theoretical predictions. Interestingly, the double-threshold voltage-current curves, indicative of electron solid formation at low densities, are not observed in the quantum Hall regime. This lack of observation does not confirm the existence of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid and indicates that quasi-particles near integer filling do not form an independent subsystem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of achieving substantial and controllable valley splitting in Si/SiGe quantum wells due to unavoidable atomic-scale disorder at the interface.

Method: Atomistic pseudopotential calculations to analyze the effects of uniaxial strain on valley splitting.

Result: Uniaxial strain linearly restores valley splitting suppressed by interfacial disorder, reduces susceptibility to disorder, and keeps variations within a narrow distribution.

Conclusion: Uniaxial strain offers a viable solution to enhance valley splitting in Si/SiGe quantum wells, improving gate uniformity for scalable quantum processors.

Abstract: Regardless of various material design strategies, experimentally achieving substantial and controllable valley splitting in Si/SiGe quantum wells remains a central challenge for ensuring high gate uniformity. This difficulty arises from unavoidable atomic-scale disorder at the interface, caused by alloy randomness, which suppresses valley splitting and, more critically, induces large variations. Here, we demonstrate that CMOS-compatible uniaxial strain can substantially enhance valley splitting, rendering it immune to interface disorder. Atomistic pseudopotential calculations show that uniaxial strain linearly restores the valley splitting suppressed by interfacial disorder, with a large enhancement rate, while keeping disorder-induced variations within a narrow distribution. We reveal that uniaxial strain introduces a new coupling channel between bulk valleys in adjacent Brillouin zones through a small momentum transfer, which markedly reduces the susceptibility of valley splitting to interfacial disorder. These findings establish a viable route to improve gate uniformity in silicon-based spin qubits, paving the way for scalable quantum processors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding electron localisation in low-dimensional systems is crucial due to its impact on thermodynamic properties and charge-transport behavior. However, studying such localisation in solid-state systems is challenging due to extrinsic disorders.

Method: The research utilized van der Waals heterostructures to explore electron localisation, specifically by creating a moiré-of-moiré superlattice in helical trilayer graphene through the interplay of two moiré patterns.

Result: The measurements revealed double moiré-induced bands, high-order Brown-Zak oscillations, and an anomalous hysteretic signal, indicating partial electron localisation driven by the loss of a periodic lattice potential.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that electron localisation in helical trilayer graphene is influenced by spatially inhomogeneous lattice potentials, providing insights into low-dimensional electronic states and offering a potential approach for controlling electron localisation in solid-state devices.

Abstract: The localisation of electrons in a lattice potential is an quantum-mechanical phenomenon and is often associated with remarkable physical properties of solids involving electron spins, electric polarisations and topological effects. In particular, even a small amount of distortion of the lattice potential can localise otherwise-delocalised quantum states in low-dimensional electron systems, dramatically influencing their thermodynamic properties and charge-transport behaviour. Study of such electron localisation induced by an aperiodic lattice potential remains exceptionally challenging in solid-state systems, since extrinsic disorders can trivially trap electrons in potential minima near disorders, obscuring the underlying quantum-mechanical origin of localisation phenomena. Van der Waals heterostructures can provide an alternative route for explorations of the phenomena via the emergence of superlattice potentials generated by rotating and stacking individual layers. Here, we report strong signatures of electron localisation in helical trilayer graphene, where the interplay of two moiré patterns gives rise to a moiré-of-moiré superlattice with distinct regions of moiré-periodic and moiré-aperiodic potentials. Remarkably, our measurements reveal the presence of double moiré-induced bands and high-order Brown-Zak oscillations, which are direct reflections of the periodic region with two constituent moiré patterns, and a superimposed anomalous hysteretic signal attributable to the aperiodic region. The data strongly suggest that electron wave functions are partially localised driven by the loss of a periodic lattice potential. Our work provides insight into the effects of spatially inhomogeneous lattice potentials on the low-dimensional electronic states and introduces a promising approach to control electron localisation for practical applications in solid-state devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Miniaturization is crucial for the development of information processing technologies and artificial neural networks, particularly in magnonic neuromorphic systems.

Method: Using micromagnetic simulations, the study demonstrates resonant coupling of propagating spin waves with the dynamics of magnetic moments of molecules arranged on a ferromagnetic layer.

Result: The platform enables control of a gap in the transmission spectrum (up to 150 MHz) via external magnetic fields or molecular arrangement, with antiferromagnetic configurations allowing further control of gap properties.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid structure offers reprogrammability and miniaturization down to the deep nanoscale, operating frequencies in the range of several GHz, key properties for the implementation of artificial neural networks.

Abstract: Miniaturization is an essential element in the development of information processing technologies and is also one of the main determinants of the usability of the tested artificial neural networks. It is also a key element and one of the main challenges in the development of magnonic neuromorphic systems. In this work, we propose a new platform for the development of these new spin-wave-based technologies. Using micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that magnetic molecules regularly arranged on the surface of a thin ferromagnetic layer enable resonant coupling of propagating spin waves with the dynamics of the molecules' magnetic moments, opening a gap in the transmission spectrum up to 150 MHz. The gap, its width, and frequency can be controlled by an external magnetic field or the arrangement of molecules on the ferromagnetic surface. Furthermore, the antiferromagnetic arrangement of the magnetic moments of molecules or clusters of molecules allows for control of the gap's position and width. Thus, the proposed hybrid structure offers reprogrammability and miniaturization down to the deep nanoscale, operating frequencies in the range of several GHz, key properties for the implementation of artificial neural networks.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Topological analysis of non-orientable Weyl semimetals reveals novel phenomena, including $ℕ2$ charge cancellation and surface state classifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain the behavior of quasi-particle excitations in non-orientable Weyl semimetals from a topological perspective.

Method: Topological analysis using exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups.

Result: Classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology, recovery of $ℕ2$ charge cancellation, and prediction of surface states.

Conclusion: The study exemplifies the potential of topological descriptions in predicting novel phenomena in Weyl semimetals.

Abstract: The quasi-particle excitations in Weyl semimetals, known as Weyl fermions, are usually forced to emerge in charge-conjugate pairs by the Nielsen--Ninomiya theorem. When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals. Our work exemplifies the vast potential of fundamental mathematical descriptions to not only aid the corresponding physical intuition, but also predict novel and hitherto overlooked phenomena of great relevance throughout the physics research forefront.

*Moru Song,Kai Chang*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Incommensurability in twisted trilayer graphene stabilizes fractional Chern insulators by suppressing competing CDW phases, with FCI gaps increasing despite worsening quantum-geometric indicators. Mixed phases and experimental protocols are also explored.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to address the challenge of stabilizing fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in realistic systems where they often compete with lattice symmetry-breaking orders like charge-density-waves (CDWs). The intrinsic incommensurability of alternating twisted trilayer graphene is proposed as a mechanism to suppress competing phases while preserving FCIs.

Method: The study employs an adiabatic approximation at the supermoiré scale to quantify incommensuration effects as phase shifts of interlayer coupling. Exact diagonalization is used to compute ground states in different local patches, revealing the relationship between FCI gaps and quantum-geometric indicators.

Result: The results show that incommensuration increases the FCI gap even when quantum-geometric indicators worsen. Mixed phases where FCIs coexist with CDWs are identified, with CDWs confined to patches of weak incommensurability. The study also outlines experimental protocols to observe these effects.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that incommensurability in alternating twisted trilayer graphene can stabilize fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) by suppressing competing charge-density-wave (CDW) phases. The counterintuitive finding that FCI gaps increase despite worsening quantum-geometric indicators underscores the unique role of incommensuration in FCI stabilization. The identification of mixed phases and discussion of experimental protocols provide a broader framework for exploring strong-correlation physics in incommensurate systems.

Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) typically emerge in topological flat bands and are regarded as lattice analogs of fractional quantum Hall states. Conventionally, the flat-band wavefunctions that support FCIs are expected to mimic the lowest Landau level, a condition that can be quantified by the quantum-geometric indicators. In realistic systems, however, FCIs often compete with lattice symmetry-breaking orders, especially when the hosting flat bands not ideal. In this work, we propose stabilizing FCIs by exploiting the intrinsic incommensurability of alternating twisted trilayer graphene, which naturally suppresses competing charge-density-wave (CDW) phase while FCIs are less effected. Within an adiabatic approximation at the supermoiré scale, the effect of incommensuration on local physics can be quantified as phase shifts of interlayer coupling. Using exact diagonalization, we compute ground states in different local patches and uncover a strikingly counterintuitive result: the FCI gap increases as the quantum-geometric indicators worsen. Within certain parameter ranges, we further identify mixed phases where FCIs coexist with CDWs, but with CDWs confined only to patches of weak incommensurability. Finally, we provide experimental protocols and discuss how incommensuration enrich the system's topology and quantum geometry. Not only do our results establish incommensuration as a robust stabilizer of FCIs, but also provide a general paradigm for exploring strong-correlation physics in incommensurate systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of consensus on the quadrupole moment of carbon atoms in graphitic samples and their finite analogs.

Method: Theoretical framework using distributed multipole method basis-space iterated Stockholder atoms (BS-ISA).

Result: The atomic quadrupole moment of a carbon atom in graphene is found to be negligible. The measured quadrupole moment in graphite likely stems from edge dipoles.

Conclusion: The atomic quadrupole moment of a carbon atom in graphene is essentially zero within the limits of precision of the numerical method used. A more realistic electrostatic model for finite graphene nanoflakes is proposed.

Abstract: It is generally assumed that the carbon atoms of graphitic samples and their finite analogs have sizable quadrupole moments, with the out-of-plane component ($Q^{\rm C}_{20}$ in traceless spherical coordinates) being the dominate contribution.
  However, there is no consensus on what the quantity is for such carbon-based systems and values reported in the literature range from $Q^{\rm C}_{20} \sim -1.14$ to $+0.79$ a.u.
  In this work we propose a theoretical framework in which well-defined statements can be made about properties of atoms-in-a-molecule (AIMs) even when these properties are not experimentally observable.
  Using this framework and the distributed multipole method basis-space iterated Stockholder atoms (BS-ISA), we show that the atomic quadrupole moment of a carbon atom in graphene is essentially zero within the limits of precision of the numerical method used.
  We explain how the experimentally measured atomic quadrupole moment of a graphite sample determined by Whitehouse \& Buckingham likely originated almost entirely from edge dipoles, and we propose a more realistic electrostatic model for finite graphene nanoflakes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the ionization behavior of silicon vacancies (V1/V2) in 4H-SiC, which is unclear due to their lack of optical blinking.

Method: Photocurrent spectroscopy of individual defects to measure wavelength dependence of excitation and ionization cross-sections.

Result: V1 and V2 exhibit similar ionization cross-sections increasing toward shorter wavelengths, with carbon vacancies dominating the background photocurrent. V2 and its environment are more robust than V1 under resonant excitation. Optimal wavelength regimes for photoelectrical spin readout are identified.

Conclusion: Photocurrent spectroscopy is established as a powerful complement to optical methods, advancing defect-based quantum device development.

Abstract: Defect charge-state dynamics are central to both spin-photon interfaces and photoelectrical spin readout. Despite the significance of silicon vacancies (V1/V2) in silicon carbide (4H-SiC) for both applications, their ionization behavior has remained unclear because their lack of optical blinking prevents conventional charge-state analysis. Here, we employ photocurrent spectroscopy of individual defects to measure the wavelength dependence of their excitation and ionization cross-sections. We reveal that V1 and V2 exhibit similar ionization cross-sections that increase toward shorter wavelengths, while carbon vacancies dominate the more steeply increasing background photocurrent. These results indicate that V2 and its surrounding environment appear more robust than V1 under resonant excitation. We also identify wavelength regimes that optimize defect-origin photocurrent for photoelectrical spin readout relative to background contributions, which differ between single-defect and ensemble measurements. Our results establish photocurrent spectroscopy as a powerful complement to optical methods, advancing the development of defect-based quantum devices.

Motivation: To explore how curvature influences skyrmion stability and to investigate the potential of curvilinear films for stabilizing skyrmions under local magnetic field stimuli.

Method: The study utilized magnetron sputtering to coat polystyrene particles with Pt/Co/Ta multilayers. Magnetic reversal behavior was analyzed using vibrating sample magnetometry. Non-invasive imaging methods, including scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and high-sensitivity in-vacuum magnetic force microscopy, were employed to observe domain patterns.

Result: Curvilinear films exhibited three-dimensional spiraling stripe states, which could be ruptured into metastable skyrmions via consecutive MFM scans under ambient conditions. This highlights the role of curvature in skyrmion stabilization.

Conclusion: Curvilinear films provide a versatile platform for stabilizing single skyrmions, facilitating studies on the interplay between interfacial and curvature-induced DMIs and enabling controlled skyrmion writing on 3D magnetic architectures.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) are promising candidates for applications in memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing. Beyond planar films, theoretical studies predict that curvature can influence skyrmion stability by introducing effective chiral interactions. Here, we investigate skyrmion formation on self-assembled polystyrene particles coated with Pt/Co/Ta multilayers by magnetron sputtering. Vibrating sample magnetometry reveals clear differences in the magnetic reversal behavior of the curvilinear film compared to that of the planar counterpart. Using non-invasive imaging methods such as scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and high-sensitivity in-vacuum magnetic force microscopy (MFM) with low moment magnetic tipcs, we observe a maze domain pattern for the planar films while the curvilinear film reveals three-dimensional spiraling stripe states. By employing a conventional MFM operating under ambient conditions requiring a tip with a higher magnetic moment, we demonstrate that these stripe states can rupture into metastable skyrmions located at the top of the spherical particles by applying consecutive scans. Our results demonstrate that curvilinear films offer an accessible platform for stabilizing single skyrmions using local magnetic field stimuli, opening pathways to study the interplay between interfacial and curvature-induced DMIs and enabling controlled skyrmion writing on three-dimensional magnetic architectures.

Motivation: To investigate the phonon magnetochiral effect (PMCE) in chiral Weyl semimetals, focusing on how a magnetic field alters the phonon dispersion due to chiral imbalance from inequivalent Weyl nodes.

Method: The research employs a semiclassical Boltzmann kinetic framework that incorporates Berry curvature, orbital magnetic moment, and node-dependent electronic structure to derive nonreciprocal dispersion relations of phonons in the presence of a magnetic field.

Result: Analytic expressions for magnetic-field-induced corrections to phonon dynamical matrix are derived, revealing specific effects on longitudinal acoustic phonons and an optical analogue of the PMCE for optical phonons.

Conclusion: The study provides a unified theoretical framework for understanding how the band-geometric properties of Weyl fermions influence both acoustic and optical phonon dispersions in chiral Weyl semimetals.

Abstract: We investigate the phonon magnetochiral effect (PMCE) in chiral Weyl semimetals by deriving the nonreciprocal dispersion relations of both acoustic and non-polar optical phonons in the presence of a magnetic field. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann kinetic framework that incorporates Berry curvature, orbital magnetic moment, and node-dependent electronic structure, we obtain analytic expressions for the magnetic-field-induced corrections to the phonon dynamical matrix. Inequivalent Weyl nodes with distinct Fermi velocities, Fermi energies, and relaxation times generate a dynamical chiral imbalance that alters the phonon dispersion. For acoustic phonons, the formalism yields the magnetic-field-dependent corrections to the longitudinal mode, while for optical phonons we identify an optical analogue of the PMCE that produces a corresponding shift in the optical branch. Together, these results provide a unified theoretical description of how band-geometric properties of Weyl fermions influence both acoustic and optical phonon dispersions in chiral Weyl semimetals.

We show that these dissipationless effects arise upon combining strains in two orthogonal directions, yielding momentum flow in the third direction. We demonstrate that the effect arises from nontrivial geometric tensors in quantum states, and can be scaled up with integer topological invariants. We further demonstrate that the effect fingerprints the multiband Hilbert-space geometry of underlying quantum states, as encoded in three-state geometric tensors.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that armchair graphene nanoribbons with short zigzag edges are the most stable platform for achieving topologically protected Majorana zero modes, providing concrete design guidelines for graphene-based topological superconductors.

Abstract: Topologically protected Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have attracted intense interest due to their potential application in fault-tolerant quantum computation (TQC). Graphene nanoribbons, with tunable edge terminations and compatibility with planar device architectures, offer a promising alternative to semiconductor nanowires. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical study of finite graphene strips with armchair, zigzag, and nearly square geometries, proximitized by an s-wave superconductor and subject to Rashba spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman fields, and disorder. Using exact diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes tight-binding Hamiltonian, we analyze Majorana polarization, low-energy spectra, and real-space wavefunctions to identify the non-trivial topological phases supporting MZMs and distinguish them from from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or the quasi-Majoranas. We systematically chart the robustness of these modes across geometries and disorder regimes, finding that armchair strips with short zigzag edges provide the most stable platform. Our results unify polarization diagnostics with spatial wavefunction analysis and disorder effects, yielding concrete design guidelines for graphene-based topological superconductors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to clarify the relationship between SCFT and polymer DFT solvers, demonstrating their shared diffusion-based propagators and how iSAFT contributions (hard sphere, attraction, association) can be integrated into SCFT.

Method: The paper employs a Legendre dual formulation to prove the equivalence, transforming iSAFT CDFT Euler-Lagrange equations into SCFT fixed point relations. It also incorporates Wertheim TPT1 association free energy and provides a reversible mapping for fluctuation corrections.

Result: The work shows how SCFT and iSAFT CDFT can share mean-field foundations, enabling the inclusion of short-range structure and association effects beyond mean-field. It also demonstrates how functional derivatives can yield SCFT field contributions and correlation operators.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a mathematical equivalence between polymer Self Consistent Field Theory (SCFT) and interfacial SAFT-based classical Density Functional Theory (iSAFT CDFT). It provides a framework for modular, quantitative modeling of associating, structured polymer systems by unifying SCFT and iSAFT CDFT on a common mean-field foundation.

Abstract: Our work establishes the mathematical equivalence between polymer Self Consistent Field Theory and interfacial SAFT based classical Density Functional Theory by providing an explicit proof that SCFT is the mean field (MF) or saddle point limit of a Legendre dual formulation of iSAFT CDFT. The polymer CDFT ideal chain term is the Legendre conjugate of the single chain generating functional built from standard SCFT propagators, so the Legendre transform converts the iSAFT CDFT Euler Lagrange equations into SCFT fixed point relations. Within this Functional Field Theory, Wertheim TPT1 association free energy can be incorporated into the excess functional, with the mass action variables providing additive SCFT fields yet leaving the propagators unchanged. Linearization about the MF solution produces a reversible mapping for fluctuation corrections, suggesting a universal response that couples the single chain correlation kernel to the iSAFT direct correlation operator, allowing the inclusion of short range structure and association cooperatively beyond mean field. Long range interactions map similarly, showing how functional derivatives can yield SCFT field contributions, while second derivatives yield the long range blocks of the iSAFT correlation operator, providing a unified treatment of polymers. Mathematically, this framework aims to clarify that SCFT and polymer DFT solvers share similar diffusion based propagators, and how iSAFT hard sphere, attraction, and association modules contribute additional field and hessian terms. Specifically, this work provides a Legendre duality proof that places SAFT CDFTs and SCFT on the same MF foundation, and a reversible theoretical framework that transfers iSAFT correlation information into SCFT, enabling modular, quantitative modeling of associating, structured polymer systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the stabilization mechanisms and phase behavior of 3D hopfions, which are less studied compared to skyrmions, for spintronic and photonic applications.

Method: 3D micromagnetic simulations within a material-independent framework applicable to magnetic and liquid crystalline systems.

Result: Four distinct types of isolated hopfions were identified, with metastability regions following modulated finger phases. Hopfions near their inflation threshold can enclose other solitons or modulated phases, forming higher-order domains, while periodic hopfion lattices are unstable.

Conclusion: The study identifies general principles for stabilizing and tuning 3D topological solitons in confined chiral systems, offering experimental routes for texture engineering in liquid crystals via electric-field control.

Abstract: Topological particle-like excitations such as skyrmions and hopfions offer rich opportunities for spintronic and photonic applications. While skyrmions have been extensively studied, the stabilization mechanisms and phase behavior of three-dimensional hopfions remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the formation, stability, and interactions of hopfions in thin chiral magnetic films with surface anchoring, using three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations within a material-independent framework applicable to both magnetic and liquid crystalline systems. We identify four distinct types of isolated hopfions, generated by rotating bimeron and finger-like solitons around a central axis. The metastability regions of these precursor textures closely follow the boundaries of modulated finger phases, enabling their size to be continuously tuned through anisotropydriven inflation and collapse. Remarkably, we demonstrate that hopfions near their inflation threshold possess energies comparable with the homogeneous state, allowing them to enclose regions of modulated phases or other solitons, forming higher-order, bag-like domains. In contrast, periodic hopfion lattices remain intrinsically unstable under confinement, spontaneously relaxing into finger phases. These findings establish general principles for stabilizing, tuning, and assembling three-dimensional topological solitons in confined chiral systems, suggesting experimentally accessible routes for texture engineering in liquid crystals via electric-field control.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a compact, energy-efficient platform for on-chip coherent microwave signal generation and processing, overcoming limitations of conventional fixed-spacing comb generation methods.

Method: The study introduces a highly nonlinear miniaturized magnonic resonator combined with a slow-wave transducer to achieve high intra-resonator power density, driving the system into a bistable regime for parametric excitation of propagating spin waves and MFC generation.

Result: The approach yields over 350 comb lines spanning a 450 MHz bandwidth with continuously tunable spacing, representing an order-of-magnitude enhancement over prior reports while operating at low power.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a new paradigm for frequency comb technology using magnonic resonators, with significant enhancements in bandwidth, tunability, and compactness, unlocking opportunities in microwave signal processing, neuromorphic computing, and precision sensing.

Abstract: Magnonic frequency combs (MFCs) offer a promising route to compact, energy-efficient platforms for on-chip coherent microwave signal generation and processing. Conventional on-chip comb generation typically relies on nonlinear resonators supporting a series of equidistant, low-loss resonances driven by a strong monochromatic signal, resulting in fixed comb spacing defined by the resonator's free spectral range (FSR). Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism for ultrabroadband MFC generation using a highly nonlinear miniaturized magnonic resonator. The small resonator volume, combined with a slow-wave transducer, yields high intra-resonator power density, driving the system deep into the bistable regime where parametric excitation of propagating spin waves facilitates comb formation. Our approach yields more than 350 comb lines spanning a 450 MHz bandwidth, with spacing continuously tunable via a two-tone external drive, representing an order-of-magnitude enhancement over prior reports while operating at relatively low power. The platform is ultra-compact (4-6 orders of magnitude smaller in size than conventional YIG sphere resonators), fully scalable, and highly tunable, enabling precise control of comb properties through magnetic bias and pump manipulation. These results establish a new paradigm for frequency comb technology, unlocking transformative opportunities in microwave signal processing, neuromorphic computing, and precision sensing.

TL;DR: A novel optical method enables real-time imaging of THz plasmons in 2D TMD semiconductors, providing insights into collective excitations and enabling new optoelectronic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the experimental challenges in accessing intrinsic THz plasmons and meV-scale excitation gaps in 2D TMD semiconductors due to their subwavelength dimensions and low conductivities.

Method: An optical readout method that images propagating THz-frequency collective modes in real time, utilizing strong coupling between optical polarons of monolayer TMD semiconductors and local THz fields in a waveguide.

Result: Successfully imaged THz plasmons with micron-scale spatial resolution, measured their propagation group velocities, and observed coherent cyclotron oscillations at finite magnetic fields.

Conclusion: The findings introduce a new near-field platform for probing collective excitations in strongly correlated 2D semiconductors and enable 'all-photonic' TMD-based architectures for THz plasmonics and optoelectronics.

Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors exhibit a wide range of novel phenomena at millielectronvolt (terahertz-frequency) energy scales, including superconducting and correlation-induced insulating gaps that are frequently accompanied by symmetry breaking. However, due to the subwavelength dimensions and the often low conductivities of these systems, their intrinsic THz plasmons and meV-scale excitation gaps are difficult to access experimentally. Here we report an optical readout method that can image propagating THz-frequency collective modes in real time. The method relies on a strong coupling between the optical polarons of monolayer TMD semiconductors and the local THz fields in a waveguide, which enables us to image THz plasmons with micron scale spatial resolution and determine their propagation group velocities. Moreover, at finite magnetic fields, we observe coherent cyclotron oscillations resulting from Landau level repopulation induced by the THz field. Our findings provide a new near-field platform for probing collective excitations in strongly correlated two-dimensional semiconductors and enable "all-photonic" TMD-based architectures for time-domain THz plasmonics and optoelectronics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the interplay of electron correlation effects and spin-orbit coupling in ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene, which may lead to topological phases.

Method: A k·p model with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations was employed to investigate the electronic ground states.

Result: The study reveals a C=3 quantum anomalous Hall state driven by intrinsic polarization and strong interactions, without needing an external electric field. Moderate interactions require minimal electric fields. Other correlation-driven metallic phases are also predicted.

Conclusion: The synergy of intrinsic polarization, electron correlations, and spin-orbit coupling in ABCB-stacked graphene governs rich topological phenomena, making it a tunable platform for exploring emergent topological states.

Abstract: ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene, with intrinsic spontaneous polarization, offers a unique platform to explore electron correlation effects, whose interplay with spin-orbit coupling may engender topological phases. Here, employing a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ model with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate its electronic ground states. Remarkably, we find that the intrinsic polarization, in conjunction with strong interactions ($U=8 \text{ eV}$) and SOC, is sufficient to drive a $C=3$ quantum anomalous Hall state, obviating the need for an external electric field typical in ABCA stacks. Conversely, at moderate interactions ($U=6 \text{ eV}$), a minimal electric field is necessary. Furthermore, calculations predict other correlation-driven metallic phases such as quarter- and three-quarter-filled states. These results establish that the synergy of intrinsic polarization, correlations, and SOC governs the rich topological phenomena, suggesting ABCB-stacked graphene as a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent topological phenomena.

Motivation: To achieve strong axial confinement in quantum dots (QDs) and understand the scaling of charging energies with QD diameter, particularly for applications requiring strong spin-orbit interactions.

Method: Combined epitaxial crystal-phase control with chemical wet etching to create strongly confined QDs, followed by low-temperature electrical characterization and finite-element method simulations to study charging energies and electron filling.

Result: Realized very small QDs with charging energy > 30 meV, identified a regime where stray capacitances limit further increases in charging energy, and demonstrated the relevance of small diameter QDs for studying spin-orbit interactions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a method to create strongly confined quantum dots in InAs nanowires by combining crystal-phase control with wet etching, revealing insights into the scaling of charging energies with QD diameter and identifying limitations due to stray capacitances.

Abstract: We realize strongly confined quantum dots (QDs) in InAs nanowires (NWs) by combining epitaxial crystal-phase control with chemical wet etching. A strong axial confinement is first introduced by growing closely spaced wurtzite (WZ) tunnel barriers in NWs to enclose a zinc blende (ZB) QD. The NW cross-section is then reduced by isotropic etching to obtain very small QDs, with a maximum observed charging energy > 30 meV. Using low-temperature electrical characterization and finite-element method simulations, we study how charging energies and the onset of electron filling scale with QD diameter. For extremely small diameters, we identify a regime where stray capacitances become non-negligible, limiting further increase in charging energy by diameter reduction alone. This approach to increasing confinement is particularly relevant for understanding the strong spin-orbit interaction observed in crystal-phase QDs, possibly linked to polarization charges at the WZ/ZB interfaces. Small diameter QDs allow considerably weaker interfering electric fields when studied, but the QDs cannot be realized with epitaxial growth alone due to a loss of crystal phase control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study was motivated by the recent observation of knot structures, such as magnetic hopfions, in condensed matter and the need for methods to control their topology.

Method: The researchers investigated the spin-orbit torque (SOT)-driven evolution of hopfions, analyzing their dynamic topological transitions and quantifying the process using an effective tension picture.

Result: The results show that SOT can split a high-Hopf-number hopfion into multiple lower-Hopf-number ones, uncovering a hierarchy of instabilities governing these transitions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that spin-orbit torque (SOT) is a potent tool for dynamically manipulating the Hopf number of magnetic hopfions, enabling topological transitions and offering potential applications in topological memory devices.

Abstract: Knots, characterized by topological invariants called the Hopf number $H$, arise from the intertwining of strings and exhibit diverse configurations. The knot structures have recently been observed in condensed matters, as examplified by a magnetic hopfion, sparking interest in controlling their topology. Here, we show that spin-orbit torque (SOT) enables dynamic manipulation of the Hopf number of magnetic hopfions. We investigate the SOT-driven evolution of hopfions, revealing the splitting of a high-$H$ hopfion into multiple lower-$H$ ones, a process that can be quantified by an effective tension picture. Comparative analysis across different $H$ uncovers a hierarchy of instabilities that dictates these dynamical topological transitions. These findings establish SOT as a powerful tool for controlling hopfion topology, paving the way for potential applications in topological memory devices.

Motivation: To understand the nonequilibrium dynamics of hopfions, particularly interconversion between different Hopf numbers, which remains poorly understood despite their unique topology.

Method: Theoretical investigation using numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-orbit torque (SOT) for hopfions with various Hopf numbers.

Result: SOT induces translational and precessional motion for H=1, while for H=2, it can forcibly split the hopfion into two H=1 hopfions. The study identifies a hierarchical structure for SOT-driven behavior and demonstrates controllability of splitting and recombination.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the controllability of hopfion topology via spin-orbit torque (SOT), revealing a hierarchical structure for predicting dynamics across different Hopf numbers. This suggests potential applications in multilevel spintronic devices.

Abstract: Hopfions--three-dimensional topological solitons with knotted spin texture--have recently garnered attention in topological magnetism due to their unique topology characterized by the Hopf number $H$, a topological invariant derived from knot theory. In contrast to two-dimensional skyrmions, which are typically limited to small topological invariants, i.e., skyrmion numbers, hopfions can, in principle, be stabilized with arbitrary Hopf numbers. However, the nonequilibrium dynamics, especially interconversion between different Hopf numbers, remain poorly understood. Here, we theoretically investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of hopfions with various Hopf numbers by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-orbit torque (SOT). For $H=1$, we show that SOT induces both translational and precessional motion, with dynamics sensitive to the initial orientation. For $H=2$, we find that intermediate SOT strengths can forcibly split the hopfion into two $H = 1$ hopfions. This behavior is explained by an effective tension picture, derived from the dynamics observed in the $H=1$ case. By comparing the splitting dynamics across different $H$, we identify a hierarchical structure governing SOT-driven behavior and use it to predict the dynamics of hopfions with general $H$. Furthermore, we show that by appropriately scheduling the time dependence of the SOT, it is possible to repeatedly induce both splitting and recombination of hopfions. These results demonstrate the controllability of hopfion topology via SOT and suggest a pathway toward multilevel spintronic devices based on topology switching.

Abstract: Ready-to-use numerical toolbox for nanodiamond Raman spectra calculation and fit is presented. The developed theoretical approach allows accounting for arbitrary nanoparticle size-distribution and the microscopic line broadening mechanisms for the optical phonons. The two tools for solving the inverse problem of the nanodiamond properties reconstruction using a known Raman spectrum are provided. The first one utilizes a dense neural network trained on a vast array of synthetic Raman spectra. The second approach is based on the stochastic Metropolis algorithm, which updates the ensemble parameters by small quantities, tending to the state with minimal error. Both methods are available thanks to the computationally instant elasticity theory-like model for optical phonon modes in diamond nanocrystals that accurately reproduces the results of the atomistic approaches. Using experimental Raman spectra for nanodiamonds prepared by various techniques, we tested our tools and observed a faithful agreement with the data as well as between the two methods.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that electric-field-induced spin splitting in multilayer WSe2 is more dominant than the magnetic-field-induced Zeeman effect, showcasing its potential for non-magnetic manipulation of spin states. This is pivotal for advancing low-power spintronic and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides provide a platform for exploring spin-valley physics, offering a promising approach to electric-field-driven spin control for low-power spintronic and quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced spin splitting in the Q and Q' valleys of multilayer n-type WSe2 using quantum-point-contact spectroscopy. Systematic modulations in four distinct conductance quantization steps, providing direct evidence of spin-valley-layer coupling-driven spin-resolved density of states, were achieved by tuning the out-of-plane gate voltage. Notably, the electric-field-induced spin splitting significantly dominated the magnetic-field-induced Zeeman effect (e.g., ~ 6 meV for a displacement field change of ~ 0.04 V/nm vs. ~ 1 meV for a magnetic field of 9 T), demonstrating a powerful, non-magnetic manipulation of spin states. This ability to manipulate spin states by gate voltage is crucial for advancing next-generation low-power spintronic and quantum information technologies.

Abstract: Spin qubits have proven to be a feasible candidate for quantum computation, and some realizations of spin qubits already benefit from advanced device manufacturing in the semiconductor industry. Compared to superconducting platforms, spin qubits can operate at higher temperatures from tens of millikelvin up to a few kelvin. However, recent experiments show a non-trivial and often non-monotonic dependence of the spin qubit frequency on the temperature, featuring a region of decreased sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. In this work, we aim to gain insight into the physics behind such temperature shifts in the low-temperature limit. Investigating the spin qubits' interaction with phonon modes of the host material, we can explain some of the key features of the observed behavior and estimate the temperature sweet spot for the qubit frequency shift.

Result: Discontinuous changes in the total current and angular momentum are observed, which can be probed via the spectral and statistical properties of the emitted radiation.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that even without a constant magnetic field, the total current in the ground state exhibits discontinuous changes due to ultrastrong light-matter coupling, analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. This behavior can be probed through the emitted radiation's spectral and statistical properties.

Abstract: We consider a quantum ring placed in a gyrotropic cavity characterized by the energy splitting between the left and right circularly polarized modes. We show that despite the absence of constant magnetic field penetrating through the ring, in the regime of the ultrastrong light matter coupling, the total current in the ground state changes discontinuously with the light matter coupling in the direct analogy with the Aharonov-Bohm ring. We consider the driven-dissipative of the system and show that the discontinuous change of the total angular momentum can be directly probed via the spectral and statical properties of the radiation emitted by the system under weak coherent drive.

Method: Proposing a time-varying electric circuit to simulate LZT, utilizing a new definition for norm-unconserved systems and analyzing the probability of circuit LZT through linear sweeping rate and frequency gap.

Result: The probability of circuit LZT follows the same laws as in quantum systems, approaching the analytical value exp(-πΔ^2/2α'), and is unaffected by the coupling type (reciprocal or nonreciprocal). A deep relationship between circuit LZT and quantum LZT is established.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the Landau-Zener tunneling (LZT) phenomenon can be replicated in classical systems using a time-varying electric circuit, despite differences in the underlying equations. This bridges a gap in simulating quantum dynamics with classical systems and opens avenues for further research.

Abstract: Landau-Zener tunneling (LZT) is a fundamental dynamical phenomenon, ubiquitous in various quantum systems. Here, we propose a time-varying electric circuit to address the question of whether the quantum LZT can occur in classical systems. Although the underlying differential equation of motion is quite different from the Schrödinger equation and the instantaneous frequency spectrum of the proposed circuit is not linear, the probability of the LZT in circuits (circuit LZT for short), based on our new definition for norm-unconserved systems, still follows the laws of the LZT in quantum systems, co-determined by the linear sweeping rate $α'$ and the frequency gap $Δ$, i.e., approaching the analytical value $\exp(-πΔ^2/2α')$, regardless of whether the coupling is reciprocal or nonreciprocal. The deep relationship between the circuit LZT and its quantum counterpart can be established through a linearization and block-diagonalization process. Our proposal provides a general method for simulating time-dependent quantum models using time-varying electric circuits, which has been lacking in previous studies, and paves the way for studying more complicated LZT and other dynamical phenomena in circuits and other classical systems.

Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for constructing all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice Hamiltonians that explicitly break time-reversal symmetry (TRS). By threading magnetic flux through disconnected polygonal plaquettes and applying local entangling unitary transformations, we map plaquettes onto families of ABF models in one, two, and three dimensions. This procedure preserves the flux configuration while converting semi-detangled geometries into ABF lattices with nontrivial hopping structure. The resulting flat bands admit compact localized states (CLSs) whose support includes both the flux-threaded plaquettes and auxiliary sites introduced by the unitary transformations. In these TRS-broken constructions, the CLSs host localized circulatory currents whose magnitude depends on the applied flux. We further extend the framework to lattices with coexisting flat and dispersive bands, illustrating cases with both orthogonal and non-orthogonal CLSs. Our results provide a controlled route for generating dispersionless lattices supporting flux-induced local currents.

Abstract: Engineering dissipative dynamics in open quantum systems is under active focus, especially in topological settings where resilient edge modes are expected to exhibit decay rates distinct from the bulk. In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes. Overall, our results provide convincing evidence that periodic driving serves as a powerful handle to manipulate dissipative topological phases and dynamically isolate the boundary modes.

In the bulk, we demonstrate the presence of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant and a non-zero mirror Chern number, making $α$-Sn one of the rare cases where dual topology can be observed. We calculate the topological phase diagram of multi-layer $α$-Sn as a function of strain and number of layers. We find that a non-trivial quantum spin Hall state appears only for compressive strain above five layers of thickness. Quite surprisingly, both in the trivial and non-trivial phases, we find a plethora of edge-states with energies inside the bulk gap of the system. Some of these states are localized at the side surfaces of the slab, some of them prefer top/bottom surfaces and some are localized in the hinges. We trace the microscopic origin of these states back to a minimal model that supports chiral symmetry and multiple one-dimensional winding numbers that take different values in different directions in the Brillouin zone.

TL;DR: The paper clarifies when metallic samples show genuine Drude behavior versus Phantom-Drude response in THz spectroscopy, offering guidelines to avoid misinterpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges in interpreting on-chip THz spectroscopy results due to finite-size and environmental effects, and to clarify the conditions under which metallic samples exhibit genuine Drude behavior.

Method: The authors identify conditions for genuine Drude response, analyze finite-size and environmental effects, and characterize the Phantom-Drude response through systematic experiments.

Result: The study identifies regimes where finite-size effects dominate, introduces the Phantom-Drude response, and demonstrates its dependence on sample and transmission line properties.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidelines to distinguish and avoid the Phantom-Drude response in on-chip THz measurements.

Abstract: On-chip THz spectroscopy enables quantitative measurements of the optical conductivity of sub-wavelength 2D materials by tightly confining THz fields in metallic transmission line structures interfaced to the material. However, because the probed structures are smaller than the THz wavelength, finite-size and environmental effects can strongly influence the measured response. Here, we identify the conditions under which a metallic sample exhibits a genuine Drude response and when finite-size and environmental effects must be considered. We further introduce and characterize an additional regime, the Phantom-Drude response, which mimics Drude behavior but instead originates from the superposition of multiple finite-momentum plasmonic resonances. If unrecognized, this regime can lead to misinterpretation of intrinsic material properties. We systematically show how the Phantom-Drude response can emerge and demonstrate its sensitivity to sample dimensions, transmission line geometry, material shape, and gate properties, providing practical guidelines to avoid this regime in future on-chip THz measurements.

TL;DR: The paper explores higher-order topological phases in chiral-symmetric systems, introduces new invariants for nonseparable models, and reveals selective boundary gap closings under symmetry breaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence in chiral-symmetric Bloch Hamiltonians, particularly in separable and nonseparable models, and to address the failure of existing invariants in nonseparable cases.

Method: The authors investigate chiral-symmetric Bloch Hamiltonians, introduce gauge-independent mirror-filtered winding numbers for Wannier Hamiltonians, and adapt periodicized Wilson lines to define new invariants associated with Wannier gaps.

Result: For separable systems, the product of subsystem chiral winding numbers correctly predicts zero-energy corner states. New invariants are introduced for nonseparable models, and selective boundary gap closings are demonstrated under mirror-symmetry breaking, extending to three dimensions.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the interplay between chiral symmetry, mirror symmetry, and Wilson loops in higher-order topological phases, while highlighting challenges in formulating momentum-space invariants for general nonseparable models.

Abstract: We investigate the higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence in a family of chiral-symmetric Bloch Hamiltonians. These models generalize the $π$-flux square lattice, the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, and include both separable and nonseparable models with extended and diagonal hopping. For separable systems, the product of subsystem chiral winding numbers correctly predicts the number of zero-energy corner states. However, this invariant fails in nonseparable models, motivating the development of new momentum-space diagnostics. We introduce gauge-independent mirror-filtered winding numbers for Wannier Hamiltonians, constructed by projecting mirror eigenstates onto the occupied subspace. Furthermore, by adapting periodicized Wilson lines from chiral Floquet theory to the case with momentum-dependent chiral operator, we define new invariants associated directly with Wannier gaps. These invariants provide a detailed characterization of Wannier band topology. Beyond symmetric models, we show that certain patterns of mirror-symmetry breaking induce selective boundary gap closings confined to a single boundary orientation while the bulk and other boundaries remain gapped. This mechanism extends to three dimensions, yielding hinge- and corner-selective transitions. Our results clarify the interplay between chiral symmetry, mirror symmetry, and Wilson loops in higher-order topological phases and point to open challenges in formulating momentum-space invariants for general nonseparable models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential quantum-phase boundary and criticality between unconventional superconductivity and field-reentrant superconductivity in high-Tc systems, which was previously only observed in low-Tc systems.

Method: Demonstrating the 4f-orbital related quantum rivalries in (Nd1-yRE'y)1-xEuxNiO2 (RE': Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd and Dy) system through innovative chemical growth methods.

Result: Robust magnetic field-reentrant superconductivity with uniaxial anisotropy is validated near the boundary of the superconducting dome with optimal-Tc near 40 K. Reinforced reentry is achieved by introducing Gd3+.

Conclusion: The findings enrich the superconducting phase-diagram for nickelates, providing an ideal platform for studying 4f-related unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality.

Abstract: Recently, a preliminary magnetic field-reentrant superconductivity manifested in high critical-temperature (Tc) Eu-doped infinite-layer (IL) nickelates, beyond analogous discoveries exclusively in low-Tc systems. This arises more intriguing fundamental issues about potential quantum-phase boundary and criticality between unconventional superconductivity and field-reentrant-one, which are inexplicable owing to formidable challenges in growing IL-nickelates towards later-series rare-earths. Herein, we demonstrate the 4f-orbital related quantum rivalries between high-Tc and reentrant superconductivity in (Nd1-yRE'y)1-xEuxNiO2 (RE': Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd and Dy) system, via opening up the chemical avenue for a quantum leap in their growths. Robust magnetic field-reentrant superconductivity with uniaxial anisotropy is validated to fringe at boundary of the superconducting dome with optimal-Tc near 40 K. Reinforced reentry is realized via introducing Gd3+ with half-filled deeper 4f-orbital energy-states, compared to Eu2+, that strengthens on-site magnetic-moment. Our findings largely enrich the superconducting phase-diagram for nickelates, establishing an ideal platform for studying 4f-related unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the superconducting origin and the fundamental role of IAEs in Cooper pairing formation, which remains unclear due to challenges in directly observing IAEs.

Method: The research combines angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), transport measurements, first-principles calculations, and high-resolution XRD measurements on oxygen-treated samples to analyze IAEs in electride La3In.

Result: IAEs in electride La3In exhibit a dual nature as both anions and free electrons. They originate from electronic states near the Fermi level, forming a Fermi sea susceptible to scattering by La-derived phonons, which triggers superconductivity. Oxygen treatment reduces free electrons and superconductivity, confirming IAEs' role in electron-phonon coupling.

Conclusion: The study resolves the ambiguity about the electronic nature of interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs) in superconducting electrides, demonstrating their dual role as anions and free electrons. It also establishes IAEs' active participation in electron-phonon coupling, enhancing superconductivity via a phonon-mediated mechanism, and lays a foundation for future research on electride-based superconductors.

Abstract: The discovery of superconducting electrides, characterized by interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs) residing in lattice cavities, has established a distinctive platform for investigating superconductors. Yet the superconducting origin and the fundamental role of IAEs in Cooper pairing formation remain poorly understood due to the challenges in directly observing IAEs. Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), transport measurements, and first-principles calculations, we certify that the IAEs in electride La3In (Tc = 9.4 K) exhibit a dual nature as both anions and free electrons. With the finite-depth potential well model, we trace that IAEs originate from electronic states near the Fermi level located above potential barriers, forming a Fermi sea susceptible to scattering by La-derived phonons, triggering superconductivity. ARPES combined with high-resolution XRD measurements on oxygen-treated samples directly reveals IAEs' spatial distribution and energy dispersion from interstitial sites with the consistent energy value predicted by our theory model. The concomitant diminution of free electrons upon oxygen treatment, leading to a marked reduction in superconductivity, further provides compelling experimental evidence that IAEs actively participate in electron-phonon coupling. Our findings resolve the long-standing ambiguity regarding the electronic nature of IAEs, elucidate their enhancing superconductivity in the phonon-mediated mechanism, and provide a foundation for exploring advanced electride-based superconductors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of flux avalanches in bulk superconductors, which differ significantly from those in thin films due to thermal limitations.

Method: High-speed magneto-optical imaging was used to directly visualize flux avalanche propagation dynamics in bulk superconducting NbTi, tracking individual events and measuring their velocities.

Result: Observed avalanche velocities of 15--25 m/s, orders of magnitude slower than thin films, with threshold field behavior consistent with slow heat removal and thermal runaway. Universal normalized velocity-distance scaling was confirmed despite varying morphologies.

Conclusion: The study reveals a previously uncharacterized thermally limited avalanche regime in bulk superconductors with poor thermal coupling, impacting flux stability and quench protection in NbTi-based magnets.

Abstract: We report the first direct visualization of flux avalanche propagation dynamics in bulk superconducting NbTi, tracking individual events and measuring their velocities using high-speed magneto-optical imaging. Unlike thin films with electromagnetic avalanches at km/s speeds, we observe velocities of 15--25 m/s, which are orders of magnitude slower. Analysis of characteristic timescales reveals that these avalanches are governed by local heating and limited heat dissipation through the adhesive layer, establishing a fundamentally different, thermally limited propagation regime. The threshold field for avalanche nucleation decreases with temperature, contrary to the increasing trend in thin films with efficient cooling - a behavior consistent with slow heat removal and thermal runaway in our system. All observed avalanches exhibit universal normalized velocity-distance scaling despite varying morphologies, confirming the robustness of thermal control. These findings reveal that bulk superconductors with poor thermal coupling operate in a previously uncharacterized avalanche regime, with direct implications for flux stability and quench protection in NbTi-based magnets, as well as a broader understanding of thermomagnetic instabilities in technological superconductors.

Motivation: To understand and maintain the superconductivity of YBCO in high-radiation environments like Tokamak fusion reactors, atomistic simulations are needed to study radiation-damage mechanisms.

Method: Developed and benchmarked four Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLPs) for YBCO (ACE, MACE, GAP, tabGAP) trained on a DFT database including irradiation-damaged configurations.

Result: The models achieved DFT-level accuracy, with MACE being the most accurate (though computationally expensive), while ACE and tabGAP offered a good balance between efficiency and fidelity.

Conclusion: The machine-learned potentials, especially MACE, ACE, and tabGAP, provide a robust foundation for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation-induced defect evolution in YBCO, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) such as YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) are essential for next-generation Tokamak fusion reactors, where Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxides (REBCO) form the functional layers in HTS magnets. Because YBCO's superconductivity depends strongly on oxygen stoichiometry and defect structure, atomistic simulations can provide crucial insight into radiation-damage mechanisms and pathways to maintain material performance.
  In this work, we develop and benchmark four Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLPs) for YBCO: the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), the Message-Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE), the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP), and the Tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), trained on an extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) database explicitly designed to include irradiation-damaged-like configurations. The resulting models achieve DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of atomic environments, faithfully capturing the interatomic forces relevant to radiation damage processes.
  Among the tested models, MACE delivers the highest accuracy, although at greater computational cost, while ACE and tabGAP provide an excellent balance between efficiency and fidelity. These machine-learned potentials establish a robust foundation for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation-induced defect evolution in complex superconducting materials

TL;DR: The paper analyzes transport anisotropies in metals and superconductors, revealing their dependence on rotational symmetry breaking scenarios and demonstrating the findings in models of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origins of transport anisotropies in metals and superconductors, specifically how rotational symmetry breaking in the normal state or the superconductor itself can induce anisotropies.

Method: Theoretical analysis of transport anisotropies in normal and superconducting phases for different broken symmetry scenarios, including zero-momentum and finite-momentum pairing, and development of a theory of vestigial order for the latter.

Result: The relative transport anisotropies in the normal and superconducting phases depend on the scenario, including the form of vestigial order and, in some cases, the parity of the superconducting order parameter.

Conclusion: Measuring the directional dependence of the critical current and resistivity can provide strong constraints on the origin of rotational symmetry breaking, as demonstrated in minimal models relevant to twisted multilayer graphene, rhombohedral graphene, and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.

Abstract: There are multiple possible origins of transport anisotropies in metals and superconductors. For instance, rotational symmetry can be spontaneously broken in the normal state as a result of electronic nematic order inducing anisotropies in an otherwise $s$-wave superconducting phase. Another possibility is that the dominant source of rotational symmetry breaking is the superconductor itself and its vestiges that may survive in the normal state. We here theoretically analyze the correlations of transport anisotropies in the normal and the corresponding superconducting phase for different scenarios of broken symmetry, either coming solely from the normal state, solely from the superconductor and its vestiges in the metallic regimes, or from both simultaneously. We further include both zero-momentum and finite-momentum pairing; we develop a theory of vestigial order for the latter, characterized by broken rotational and translational symmetry. Our findings reveal that the relative transport anisotropies in the normal and superconducting phases sensitively depend on the scenario, including the form of vestigial order and, in some cases, the parity of the superconducting order parameter. As such, measuring the directional dependence of the critical current and resistivity can provide strong constraints on the origin of rotational symmetry breaking. We demonstrate our findings in minimal models relevant to twisted multilayer graphene, rhombohedral graphene, and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why La3In exhibits ambient-pressure superconductivity and investigate its electronic properties, given its contrast with other chemically reactive and unstable superconducting electrides.

Method: Combined angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations were used to analyze the low-energy electronic structure of La3In.

Result: The bands near the Fermi energy are derived from La 5d and In 5p orbitals, with the observation of a saddle point and a three-dimensional van Hove singularity. First-principles calculations reveal topological Dirac surface states within the bulk energy gap.

Conclusion: La3In is identified as a promising material for tuning superconductivity and exploring topological superconducting phases, due to its unique electronic structure and ambient-pressure superconductivity.

Abstract: Superconducting electrides have attracted growing attention for their potential to achieve high superconducting transition temperatures (TC) under pressure. However, many known electrides are chemically reactive and unstable, making high-quality single-crystal growth, characterization, and measurements difficult, and most do not exhibit superconductivity at ambient pressure. In contrast, La3In stands out for its ambient-pressure superconductivity (TC ~ 9.4 K) and the availability of high-quality single crystals. Here, we investigate its low-energy electronic structure using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The bands near the Fermi energy are mainly derived from La 5d and In 5p orbitals. A saddle point is directly observed at the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary, while a three-dimensional van Hove singularity crosses EF at the BZ corner. First-principles calculations further reveal topological Dirac surface states within the bulk energy gap above EF. The coexistence of a high density of states and in-gap topological surface states near EF suggests that La3In offers a promising platform for tuning superconductivity and exploring possible topological superconducting phases through doping or external pressure.

Method: The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed.

Result: The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics, with frequency shifts scaling linearly with absorbed power and dissipation response saturating at higher powers, indicating a transition to a saturated dissipation regime.

Conclusion: The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.

Abstract: The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.

Motivation: The goal was to experimentally observe subgap transport in spin-split superconducting junctions and understand the role of highly transparent channels in transport phenomena.

Method: The researchers conducted differential conductance measurements on ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor/insulator/superconductor junctions (EuS/Al/AlOx/Al vertical stacks). They combined experiments with quasiclassical transport modeling to analyze the spin-splitting and transmission channels.

Result: The study revealed multiple Andreev reflection peaks, with odd-order peaks showing spin-splitting effects while even-order peaks remained unaffected. A significant fraction (~23%) of highly transparent channels dominated transport, and the presence of a Josephson current confirmed strong superconducting coupling.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that a single spin-split superconductor can exhibit the even-odd MAR (multiple Andreev reflection) effect, establishing EuS/Al junctions as a versatile platform for studying subgap transport, Josephson coupling, and spin-polarized superconducting phenomena.

Abstract: We report the first experimental observation of subgap transport in ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor/insulator/superconductor junctions realized in EuS/Al/AlOx/Al vertical stacks. Differential conductance measurements reveal multiple Andreev reflection peaks, with odd-order peaks split by the spin-splitting induced in the superconductor adjacent to EuS, while even-order peaks remain unaffected. Combining experiments with quasiclassical transport modeling, we extract the spin-splitting and the distribution of transmission channels, finding that a significant fraction ($\sim 23\%$) of highly transparent channels ($τ\approx 0.9$) dominates transport. The observation of a Josephson current further confirms strong superconducting coupling through these channels. Our results demonstrate that a single spin-split superconductor is sufficient to observe the even-odd MAR effect. Our work establishes EuS/Al junctions as a versatile platform to study subgap transport, Josephson coupling, and spin-polarized superconducting phenomena.

Motivation: To understand the plasmon spectrum in dirty superconductors across the entire temperature range and explore its behavior at and below the superconducting transition temperature Tc.

Method: Using the microscopic Keldysh sigma model, the research analytically continues the optical conductivity to the lower half-plane of complex frequency.

Result: Plasmon dispersion shows a discontinuity at Tc and terminates at a critical wave vector qc(T), with significant attenuation only near Tc.

Conclusion: The study links plasmon dispersion to the optical conductivity of superconductors, revealing a discontinuity at the superconducting transition and termination of plasmon dispersion at a critical wave vector below Tc.

Abstract: We develop a theory for the plasmon spectrum in dirty superconductors across the entire temperature range. Starting with the microscopic Keldysh sigma model description, we link the plasmon dispersion $ω(q)$ to the optical conductivity $σ(ω,T)$ of a superconductor, which requires analytical continuation to the lower half-plane of complex frequency. This approach reveals a discontinuity at the superconducting transition: a jump in both the real and imaginary parts of $ω(q)$ at $T_c$. For any temperature below $T_c$, the plasmon dispersion terminates at a critical wave vector $q_c(T)$ where plasmons remains undamped, with $ω[q_c(T)] \approx 2Δ(0)$. Plasmons significantly attenuate only within a narrow 5% temperature window near $T_c$, with the propagating mode recovering at large $q$.

Abstract: We study the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf lattice using several numerical approaches, focusing on the numerical linked-cluster expansion (NLCE), which exhibits an unconventional convergence extending to low and even zero temperatures. We evaluate thermodynamic properties as well as spin-spin correlations through the equal-time structure factor. Within NLCE the specific heat capacity reveals a two-peak structure at $T_1 \approx 0.479\,J$ and $T_2 \approx 0.131\,J$, reminiscent of the corresponding result for the triangular lattice. At intermediate temperatures, the spin-spin structure factor develops features that reflect the absence of reflection symmetry in the lattice. The zero-temperature convergence of NLCE enables reliable estimates of the ground-state energy and points to a short-range correlated paramagnetic ground state composed of resonating hexagonal motifs. The NLCE results are benchmarked against Pseudo-Majorana Functional Renormalization Group, finite-temperature Lanczos, and classical Monte Carlo simulations.

Motivation: To explore exotic quantum states in the doped quantum spin liquid on the kagome lattice, particularly the holon Wigner crystal and potential superconducting states.

Method: The kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model is studied using state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations on $L_y=3$ and $L_y=4$ cylinders.

Result: A quantum phase diagram is established, showing a Fermi-liquid-like state emerging at $δ≈0.15$ and a possible precursor of superconductivity near $δ=1/3$, though the latter is lattice size dependent.

Conclusion: The study reveals a quantum melting transition from a holon Wigner crystal to a Fermi-liquid-like state with increasing hole density, and identifies a potential doping regime for exploring superconductivity.

Abstract: The doped quantum spin liquid on the kagome lattice provides a fascinating platform to explore exotic quantum states, such as the reported holon Wigner crystal at low doping. By extending the doping range to $δ= 0.027$ - $0.36$, we study the kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model using the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation. On the $L_y=3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with increasing doping level. In addition to the charge density wave (CDW) states at lower doping, we find an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase by melting the holon Wigner crystal at $δ\approx 0.15$, which is characterized by suppression of charge density oscillation and power-law decay of various correlation functions. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, the bond-dimension extrapolated correlation functions also support such a Fermi-liquid-like state, suggesting its stability with increasing system size. In a narrow doping range near $δ= 1/3$ on the $L_y = 3$ cylinder, we find a state with an exponential decay of single-particle correlation but the other correlation functions preserving the features in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, which may be a precursor of a superconducting state. Nevertheless, this peculiar state near $δ= 1/3$ disappears on the $L_y = 4$ cylinder, implying a possible lattice size dependence. Our results reveal a quantum melting from a holon Wigner crystal to a Fermi-liquid-like state with increasing hole density, and suggest a doping regime to explore superconductivity for future study.

Method: The researchers used the sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC) algorithm to study magnetic phases in 2D bipartite quasicrystals at half-filling. They also conducted symmetry analysis to propose a criterion for magnetism classification.

Result: The study found that Néel states in bipartite QCs can exhibit altermagnetism (AM) or ferromagnetism (FM) in addition to antiferromagnetism (AFM). A general criterion based on sublattice symmetry was proposed, with examples showcasing AM in Thue-Morse QCs and FM in the Penrose QC.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that altermagnetism (AM) can exist in quasicrystals (QCs) and provides a general criterion for determining the magnetism classes of Néel states in bipartite QCs. This opens new avenues for experimental investigations and applications of different magnetism classes in QCs.

Abstract: Magnetism is a fundamental research area in which the recently proposed altermagnetism (AM) has become an emergent frontier. Very recently, the quasicrystal (QC) was proposed as a possible platform to realize AM. However, the existence of AM in QCs still lacks vigorous evidence. In this work, we adopt the sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC) algorithm to investigate the magnetic phases in the half-filled Hubbard models in various 2D bipartite QCs, and always obtain Néel ordered states. While the Néel states in bipartite crystals are usually antiferromagnetism (AFM), we find it common that those in bipartite QCs can also be AM or ferromagnetism (FM). Based on symmetry analysis, combined with our comprehensive PQMC results, we propose a general criterion for determining the magnetism classes of the Néel states in a bipartite QC: According to whether the two sublattices are related by the inversion, the other point-group operation, or no operation about the unique symmetry center in the QC, the corresponding Néel state is AFM, AM or FM, respectively. For example, our results yield AM for the two $D_4$-symmetric Thue-Morse QCs and FM for the $D_5$-symmetric Penrose QC at half-filling. Our results provide a solid foundation for experimental investigations and potential applications of different classes of magnetism in QCs.

TL;DR: 研究 Nd₂Zr₂O₇ 和 Pr₂Zr₂O₇ 单晶在强脉冲磁场下的磁性能，发现慢热传递现象，其中 Nd₂Zr₂O₇ 的热耦合依赖于磁场变化速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索 Nd₂Zr₂O₇ 和 Pr₂Zr₂O₇ 单晶在强脉冲磁场下的磁性能和热力学行为，以揭示磁性子系统与晶格之间的非平衡热传递机制。

Method: 通过磁化强度和磁热效应（MCE）测量，研究了 Nd₂Zr₂O₇ 和 Pr₂Zr₂O₇ 单晶在脉冲磁场（高达 60 T）下的磁性能，温度范围为 2K 至 31K。使用了包含磁离子、声子和热库的热耦合子系统的唯象模型来解释实验结果。

Result: 观察到 Nd₂Zr₂O₇ 的 MCE 数据出现明显的平台现象，随后温度迅速上升；磁性子系统的推测温度与直接测量的样品温度存在显著差异。唯象模型对 Pr₂Zr₂O₇ 的解释较好，但对 Nd₂Zr₂O₇ 的平台现象需引入热耦合对 HdH/dt 的依赖关系才得到改善。

Conclusion: 我们的结果表明，Nd₂Zr₂O₇ 和 Pr₂Zr₂O₇ 中的磁性子系统与晶格之间的热传递异常缓慢，特别是在 Nd₂Zr₂O₇ 中，热耦合依赖于磁场变化速率（HdH/dt），这为动态控制热流提供了一种新机制。

Abstract: We explore the magnetic properties of Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ single crystals subjected to pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T using magnetization and magnetocaloric-effect (MCE) measurements, with initial temperatures ranging from 2 to 31K. The MCE data exhibit pronounced and unconventional hysteresis loops, in which the sample temperature increases during both the up-sweep and down-sweep of the field. In Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, the MCE further displays a striking plateau as a function of time, followed by a rapid temperature rise that begins at the maximum applied field, across pulses with differing peak-field strengths. Our magnetization measurements reveal an inferred temperature of the magnetic subsystem that differs significantly from the directly measured sample temperature and exhibits opposite hysteresis: the temperature is higher on the up-sweep than the down-sweep, unlike the direct measurements. These observations indicate a breakdown of thermal equilibrium between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom on the timescale of the pulse ($\sim 10^{-1}$s). We interpret the results using a phenomenological model involving two thermally coupled subsystems - the magnetic ions and phonons, and a thermal reservoir, which accounts well for the behavior of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. However, it fails to reproduce the plateau seen in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. Agreement with Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ data is improved substantially if we allow the thermal coupling between the magnetic and the lattice subsystems to depend on the product $\frac{HdH}{dt}$. Our results reveal anomalously slow heat transfer between magnetic and lattice subsystems and point toward a novel mechanism for dynamically controlling the heat flow in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ via the rate of magnetic field variation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the role of topological data from one dimension higher in determining local dynamics in conformal field theory (CFT).

Method: Development of a TC renormalization (TCR) algorithm adapted to CFT-based structures, forming an RG framework with generalized symmetry.

Result: The full FP tensor can emerge from the RG flow starting with only the three-point function of primary fields, and topological bootstrap reconstructs it solely from topological data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the emergence of a full fixed-point tensor from the RG flow, even when starting solely from topological data, deepening the connection between topological and dynamical aspects of CFT.

Abstract: Recent progress in generalized symmetry and topological holography has shown that, in conformal field theory (CFT), topological data from one dimensional higher can play a key role in determining local dynamics. Based on this insight, a fixed-point (FP) tensor complex (TC) for CFT has recently been constructed. In this work, we develop a TC renormalization (TCR) algorithm adapted to this CFT-based structure, forming a renormalization-group (RG) framework with generalized symmetry. We show that the full FP tensor can emerge from the RG flow starting with only the three-point function of the primary fields. Remarkably, even when starting solely from topological data, the RG process can still reconstruct the full FP tensor--a method we call as topological bootstrap. This approach deepens the connection between the topological and dynamical aspects of CFT and suggests pathways toward a fully algebraic description of gapless quantum states, with potential extensions to higher dimensions.

TL;DR: A method for computing the energy variance of iPEPS using CTRMG improves accuracy and enables precise ground-state energy extrapolations, validated across multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a systematic approach for accurately computing the energy variance of iPEPS, enabling precise ground-state energy extrapolations.

Method: The method involves contracting a large cell of tensors using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTRMG) to evaluate the correlator between pairs of local Hamiltonian terms.

Result: The accuracy of the approach is substantially higher than previous methods, as demonstrated in the Heisenberg model, a free fermionic model, and the Shastry-Sutherland model.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves the accuracy of ground-state energy calculations for iPEPS, demonstrating its effectiveness through various models and applications in open quantum systems.

Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tensor network ansatz for two-dimensional quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper we introduce an approach to accurately compute the energy variance of an iPEPS, enabling systematic extrapolations of the ground-state energy to the exact zero-variance limit. It is based on the contraction of a large cell of tensors using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTRMG) method, to evaluate the correlator between pairs of local Hamiltonian terms. We show that the accuracy of this approach is substantially higher than that of previous methods, and we demonstrate the usefulness of variance extrapolation for the Heisenberg model, for a free fermionic model, and for the Shastry-Sutherland model. Finally, we apply the approach to compute $\langle \langle \mathcal{L}^\dagger \mathcal{L} \rangle \rangle$ for an open quantum system described by the Liouvillian $\mathcal{L}$, in order to assess the quality of the steady-state solution and to locate first-order phase transitions, using the dissipative quantum Ising model as an example.

Motivation: To uncover and classify the robust tetrahedral magnetic ground state and surrounding symmetry-broken magnetic states in monolayer graphene doped to the van Hove singularity.

Method: Unrestricted Hartree-Fock simulations on large supercells with dense k-point sampling, resolving interaction-driven magnetic and charge inhomogeneities.

Result: Identification of a cascade of symmetry-broken magnetic states (pseudo-tetrahedral, planar, collinear, and modulated textures) and confirmation of the tetrahedral state's stability across all finite interactions.

Conclusion: The study confirms the tetrahedral magnetic ground state as the central correlated instability in monolayer graphene doped to the van Hove singularity, connecting with experimental findings and providing predictive insights for correlated Dirac materials.

Abstract: We reveal the emergence of a robust tetrahedral magnetic ground state in monolayer graphene doped to the van Hove singularity (vHS). This noncoplanar, gapped spin configuration -- featuring four orthogonal moments -- has been previously identified as a candidate instability. Here, not only do we confirm its stability across all finite interactions using fully self-consistent, real-space-resolved calculations, but we also go beyond earlier work by charting the full surrounding phase diagram. In doing so, we unravel a cascade of symmetry-broken magnetic states -- pseudo-tetrahedral, planar, collinear, and modulated textures -- which we classify using spin structure factors and vector order parameters. These results stem from unrestricted Hartree-Fock simulations on large supercells with dense k-point sampling, enabling us to resolve interaction-driven magnetic and charge inhomogeneities. Our findings connect directly with recent ARPES and doping experiments near the vHS in graphene, and establish the tetrahedral state as the central correlated instability in this regime, offering predictive insight into emergent magnetism in correlated Dirac materials.

TL;DR: Electronic nematicity in kagome superconductors is intrinsic and unrelated to charge density waves, persisting even when the latter is suppressed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether the rotational symmetry breaking in the electronic structure of kagome superconductors is due to the charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism.

Method: Spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy was used to explore the phase diagram of CsV3Sb5 as a function of doping, intentionally suppressing the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions.

Result: Rotational symmetry breaking persists in short-range nanoscale regions across all samples, even after the charge density wave is suppressed, indicating ubiquitous electronic nematicity.

Conclusion: The experiments reveal that electronic nematicity is an intrinsic property of the parent state of kagome superconductors, unrelated to the charge density wave, and likely influences other exotic low-temperature phenomena.

Abstract: Kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = Cs, K, Rb) have developed into an exciting playground for realizing and exploring exotic solid state phenomena. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave. This further points towards electronic nematicity as the intrinsic nature of the parent state of kagome superconductors, under which other exotic low-temperature phenomena subsequently emerge.

Conclusion: 非平凡拓扑相通常在窄带隙半导体中涌现，需要自旋轨道耦合和电子关联的微妙结合。$α$-Sn作为钻石晶格的同素异形体，展示了这一行为，其拓扑相可以通过晶格的微小畸变进行调控。尽管实验进展迅速，但理论描述缺乏预测性，主要依赖紧束缚模型和密度泛函理论的不可控近似。采用自洽相对论GW方法（scGW）克服了这些限制，不仅重现了实验观察到的零带隙半导体和应变诱导的拓扑绝缘体及狄拉克半金属相，还预测了一些新的平庸和拓扑绝缘体以及狄拉克半金属相，进一步展示了$ \alpha $-Sn在能带工程中的多功能性。此外，提出了一种基于能带和轨道占据色散联合分析的稳健拓扑行为诊断方法，适用于相关方法，填补了标准基于平均场的拓扑不变量不足的空白。这些发现为利用精确的第一性原理方法研究更广泛的拓扑材料铺平了道路。

Abstract: Non-trivial topological phases often emerge in narrow-gap semiconductors with a delicate blend of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation. The diamond-lattice allotrope of Sn ($α$-Sn) exemplifies this behavior, hosting multiple topological phases that can be tuned by small distortions in the lattice. Despite rapid experimental progress, theoretical descriptions of $α$-Sn lack predictive power and rely mainly on tight-binding models and density functional theory with uncontrolled approximations. We employ first-principles fully self-consistent, relativistic GW (scGW) to overcome these limitations. The scGW recovers the experimentally observed zero-gap semiconductor and the strain-induced topological insulator and Dirac semimetal phases, while also predicting new trivial and topological insulators and a Dirac semimetal phase, further demonstrating the versatility of $α$-Sn for band engineering. Additionally, we propose a robust diagnostic of topological behavior based on a combined analysis of band and orbital-occupation dispersions, tailored for correlated methods where standard mean-field-based topological invariants fall short. Our findings pave the way for studying a broad class of topological materials using accurate first-principles methods beyond density functional theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the microscopic origin of magnetic toroidal monopoles observed in Co2SiO4 and explore their behavior under electric fields.

Method: The study employs a minimal spin model with magnetoelectric coupling via d-p hybridization, analyzed within mean-field approximation.

Result: The model reproduces the temperature dependence of dielectric constant and electric-field-direction sensitivity. It also predicts a second-order nonlinear magnetoelectric response, consistent with Co2SiO4's symmetry as an altermagnet.

Conclusion: The proposed minimal spin model successfully explains the experimental observations of magnetic toroidal monopoles in Co2SiO4 and predicts a second-order nonlinear magnetoelectric response. The framework's applicability to other antiferromagnetic olivines suggests its robustness and generality for studying toroidal-type magnetoelectric responses.

Abstract: Beyond conventional electric and magnetic monopoles, electric and magnetic toroidal monopoles, which are rank-0 multipoles distinguished by opposite parities under spatial inversion and time reversal, can exist in nature. The recent observation of electric-field-induced directional dichroism in antiferromagnetic olivine Co$_2$SiO$_4$ has provided the first concrete example of a magnetic toroidal monopole; however, its microscopic origin remains elusive. Here, we propose a minimal spin model that incorporates magnetoelectric coupling via the $d$-$p$ hybridization mechanism and analyze it within the mean-field approximation. The model qualitatively reproduces the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the dielectric constant and its pronounced sensitivity to the direction of the applied electric field. Furthermore, it elucidates the temperature evolution of the magnetic toroidal monopole and the strong electric-field-direction dependence of the magnetic toroidal moment. Our calculations also predict a second-order nonlinear magnetoelectric response, consistent with the symmetry classification of Co$_2$SiO$_4$ as an altermagnet. Additionally, we demonstrate that the same framework is applicable to other antiferromagnetic olivines with analogous magnetic order, indicating the robustness and generality of the toroidal-type magnetoelectric response in this material family.

Result: Achieved noise-free data within 30 seconds and sufficient statistical accuracy in 40 seconds; demonstrated high signal-to-noise ratio with 51.6 meV energy resolution.

Conclusion: The developed noise removal system for SX-ARPES effectively reduces the time burden and improves data quality, paving the way for future advancements in lower photoelectron yield measurements.

Abstract: Soft X-ray angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) is one of the most powerful spectroscopic techniques to visualize the three-dimensional bulk electronic structure in reciprocal lattice space. Compared with ARPES employing low-energy photon sources, the time burden imposed by a lower photoelectron yield, stemming from the photoionization cross-section, has been a persistent technical challenge. To address this challenge, we have developed a noise removal system by using the deep prior-based method and integrated it into the micro focused SX-ARPES (μSX-ARPES) system at BL25SU in SPring-8. Our implemented system effectively eliminates the grid and spike noise typically present in ARPES data acquired using the voltage Fixed-mode, within about 30 seconds. We demonstrate, through the μSX-ARPES measurements on a single crystal of CeRu2Si2, that data with sufficient statistical accuracy can be obtained in approximately 40 seconds. In addition, we present the potential of high signal-to-noise ratio ARPES measurement, achieving an energy resolution of 51.6 meV at an excitation energy of 708 eV in μSX-ARPES measurements on polycrystalline gold. Our developed system successfully reduces the time burden in SX-ARPES and paves the way for advancements in lower photoelectron yield measurements, such as those requiring higher energy resolution and three-dimensional nonequilibrium measurements.

Result: Extracted Landau parameters show the crossover, and the sKO$^+$ ansatz accurately models the electron-electron scattering amplitude, validating thermal resistivity predictions against experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed sKO$^+$ effective interaction, derived from high-precision calculations, accurately captures electron-electron scattering and matches experimental thermal resistivity measurements in simple metals.

Abstract: We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the four-point vertex function for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas using variational diagrammatic Monte Carlo. From these results, we extract Landau parameters that demonstrate a density-driven crossover from underscreening to overscreening. Guided by our numerical data, we propose a charge-based Kukkonen--Overhauser effective interaction within the local-density approximation, supplemented by a small s-wave correction (sKO$^+$), which accurately captures the electron--electron scattering amplitude. Using our numerically determined scattering amplitude, together with the sKO$^+$ ansatz, we compute the electron-electron contribution to the thermal resistivity, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimental measurements in simple metals.

Motivation: To understand the spontaneous emergence of stable trions at the surface of Ta2NiS5, which defies conventional band theory and provides insights into interaction-driven surface states.

Method: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy was used to observe and analyze the in-gap feature indicative of trion formation.

Result: A sharp, localized in-gap feature was observed, attributed to the formation of negative trions stabilized by surface-induced band bending and the material's quasi-one-dimensional geometry.

Conclusion: This study establishes Ta2NiS5 as a unique platform for investigating many-body physics at surfaces and offers new opportunities for controlling collective excitations in low-dimensional systems.

Abstract: Trions, three-body bound states composed of an exciton and an additional charge, are typically fragile and require external excitation to form. Here, we report the spontaneous emergence of a stable trion gas at the surface of the layered semiconductor Ta2NiS5, revealed through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We observe a sharp, highly localized in-gap feature that cannot be explained by conventional band-theory. Instead, we argue that it arises from the formation of negative trions, stabilized by surface-induced band bending and the material's quasi-one-dimensional geometry. Unlike excitons, these trions form without optical pumping and persist at equilibrium, marking a rare example of an interaction-driven surface state in a nominally conventional semiconductor. Our findings establish Ta2NiS5 as a unique platform for exploring many-body physics at surfaces and open new avenues for studying and controlling collective excitations in low-dimensional systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the incorrect prediction of a deep-valence Fe $3d$ peak in antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$ by conventional static Hubbard corrections, which contradicted experimental data from hard-X-ray photoemission.

Method: The researchers used a recent generalization of DFT+$U$ to include frequency-dependent screening (DFT+$U(ω)$) and a dynamical Hubbard functional (dynH). The screened Coulomb interaction $U(ω)$ was computed with spin-polarized RPA and projected onto maximally localized Fe $3d$ Wannier orbitals.

Result: DFT+$U(ω)$ predicts a fundamental band gap of $1.53\,\text{eV}$ consistent with experiments and eliminates the unphysical deep-valence peak. The simulated HAXPES spectrum matches or exceeds the accuracy of more demanding DFT+DMFT calculations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the critical role of dynamical screening in complex oxides and establishes DFT+$U(ω)$ as a predictive and computationally efficient method for correlated materials, addressing the limitations of conventional static Hubbard corrections.

Abstract: We study the electronic structure and dynamical correlations in antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$, a prototypical room-temperature multiferroic, using a variety of static and dynamical first-principles methods. Conventional static Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$, DFT+$U$+$V$) incorrectly predict a deep-valence Fe $3d$ peak (around $-7\,\text{eV}$) in antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$, in contradiction with hard-X-ray photoemission. We resolve this failure by using a recent generalization of DFT+$U$ to include a frequency-dependent screening -- DFT+$U(ω)$ -- or using a dynamical Hubbard functional (dynH). The screened Coulomb interaction $U(ω)$, computed with spin-polarized RPA and projected onto maximally localized Fe $3d$ Wannier orbitals, is expressed as a sum-over-poles, yielding a self-energy that augments the Kohn--Sham Hamiltonian. This DFT+$U(ω)$ approach predicts a fundamental band gap of $1.53\,\text{eV}$, consistent with experiments, and completely eliminates the unphysical deep-valence peak. The resulting simulated HAXPES spectrum reproduces the experimental lineshape with an accuracy matching or exceeding that of far more demanding DFT+DMFT calculations. Our work demonstrates the critical nature of dynamical screening in complex oxides and establishes DFT+$U(ω)$ as a predictive, computationally efficient method for correlated materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from understanding the role of exact higher-form symmetries in breaking ergodicity and their impact on the dynamics of lattice systems.

Method: The study focuses on two-dimensional lattice systems with local interactions and finite on-site Hilbert space dimension, analyzing the implications of $U(1)$ higher-form symmetries on ergodicity.

Result: Results include the demonstration of Hilbert space fragmentation, exponential scaling of Krylov sectors with system size, and identification of emergent integrals of motion.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that exact $U(1)$ higher-form symmetries present a fundamental obstruction to ergodicity in certain lattice systems, leading to Hilbert space fragmentation and emergent integrals of motion.

Abstract: We argue that the presence of \emph{any} exact $U(1)$ higher-form symmetry, under mild assumptions, presents a fundamental obstruction to ergodicity under unitary dynamics in lattice systems with local interactions and finite on-site Hilbert space dimension. Focusing on the two-dimensional case, we show that such systems necessarily exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation and explicitly construct Krylov sectors whose number scales exponentially with system size. While these sectors cannot be distinguished by symmetry quantum numbers, we identify the emergent integrals of motion which characterize them. Our symmetry-based approach is insensitive to details of the Hamiltonian and the lattice, providing a systematic explanation for ergodicity-breaking in a range of systems, including quantum link models.

Conclusion: 本研究通过对长程相互作用系统的分析，展示了如何通过初始条件调控信息的传播方式，为量子信息处理和模拟设备的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: While for non-relativistic short-range interactions, the spread of information is local, remaining confined in an effective light cone, long-range interactions can generate either nonlocal (faster-than-ballistic) or local (ballistic) spread of correlations depending on the initial conditions. This makes long-range interactions a rich platform for controlling the spread of information. Here, we derive an effective Hamiltonian analytically and identify the specific interaction term that drives nonlocality in a wide class of long-range spin chains. This allows us to understand the conditions for the emergence of local behavior in the presence of nonlocal interactions and to identify a regime where the causal space-time landscape can be precisely designed. Indeed, we show that for large long-range interaction strength or large system size, initial conditions can be chosen in a way that allows a local perturbation to generate nonlocal signals at programmable distant positions, which then propagate within effective light cones. The possibility of engineering the emergence of nonlocal Lieb-Robinson-like light cones allows one to shape the causal landscape of long-range interacting systems, with direct applications to quantum information processing devices, quantum memories, error correction, and information transport in programmable quantum simulators.

### [154] [Entropy production and non-Gaussianity of fast processes at weak damping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22079)
*Mario A. Ciampini,Jakob Rieser,Nikolai Kiesel,Andreas Dechant*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: A method decomposes entropy production in underdamped systems into non-equilibrium effects, showing that key contributions can be estimated from experimental data of nano-particles, providing a practical 'Gaussian' estimate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the different sources of entropy production in underdamped dynamics, which can be useful for experimental applications.

Method: The method involves decomposing entropy production into contributions from non-equilibrium effects (non-zero average velocity, non-thermal width of velocity distribution, correlations between position and velocity, and non-Gaussian velocity statistics) and estimating each from experimental trajectory data of levitated nano-particles subject to non-linear forces.

Result: The majority of entropy production rate is attributed to the first three contributions (non-zero average velocity, non-thermal width of velocity distribution, and position-velocity correlations), enabling a simpler estimation method.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical 'Gaussian' estimate for the entropy production rate by focusing on the most significant contributions, which can be derived from first and second moments of position and velocity.

Abstract: We present a method of estimating the rate of entropy production in underdamped dynamics by decomposing it into contributions originating in different non-equilibrium effects. Specifically, a non-zero average velocity, a non-thermal width of the velocity distribution, correlations between position and velocity and non-Gaussian velocity statistics represent different ways in which the system can be out of equilibrium and each give rise to a positive contribution to the overall entropy production rate. We demonstrate that each contribution can be separately estimated from experimental trajectory data of levitated nano-particles subject to non-linear forces. We find that the majority of the entropy production rate can be attributed to the first three contributions which can be estimated from the first and second moments of the position and velocity and therefore result in a useful \enquote{Gaussian} estimate for the entropy production rate.

Abstract: For one-dimensional spin and pseudospin models that allow mapping to a Markov chain, the free energy of the system at a finite temperature can be expressed in terms of bond concentrations. Minimizing the free energy function makes it possible to obtain an exact solution of a statistical model. A dilute Ising chain with interacting impurities is considered as an example.

TL;DR: Analyzing first-passage-time factorial moments (FPTFMs) of random walks on Cayley trees reveals tree structure, but waiting phases complicate identification. A framework for network reconstruction from FPT data is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To infer key parameters like tree depth and geometric bias in complex structures using tracer particle movement, despite challenges posed by waiting phases (e.g., sticky branch walls or traps).

Method: Discrete-time random walks on finite Cayley trees are analyzed, focusing on first passage properties. The generating function of the first passage time distribution is decomposed to relate waiting time distributions and FPTFMs.

Result: The first two FPTFMs uniquely determine tree structure without waiting phases, but additional moment measurements or fitting methods are needed when waiting phases are present.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that tracking tracer particles through first-passage-time factorial moments (FPTFMs) can uniquely determine tree structures, but complications arise with waiting phases. By decomposing the generating function of FPT distribution, the framework enables reconstruction of tree-like networks from FPT data, applicable in biological transport and spatial networks.

Abstract: Tracking the movement of tracer particles has long been a strategy for uncovering complex structures. Here, we study discrete-time random walks on finite Cayley trees to infer key parameters such as tree depth and geometric bias toward the root or leaves. By analyzing first passage properties, we show that the first two first-passage-time factorial moments (FPTFMs) uniquely determine the tree structure. However, if the random walker experiences waiting phases -- due to sticky branch walls or presence of traps -- this identification becomes nontrivial. We demonstrate that the generating function of the first passage time (FPT) distribution decomposes into contributions from the waiting time distribution and the random walk without waiting, leading to a nonlinear system of equations relating the factorial moments of the waiting time distribution and the FPTFMs of random walks with and without waiting. For geometrically distributed waiting times, additional moment measurements do not suffice, but unique determination of the structure is achieved by varying initial conditions or fitting the Fourier transform of the FPT distribution to measured data. The latter method remains effective also for power-law waiting time distributions, where higher-order FPTFMs are undefined. These results provide a framework for reconstructing tree-like networks from FPT data, with applications in biological transport and spatial networks.

TL;DR: Study of four-vector work in a relativistic piston confirms Jarzynski's equality, with work distribution showing unique concentration patterns. A new geometrical technique for relativistic collisions is introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the non-equilibrium four-vector work in an expanding relativistic piston and verify the covariant form of Jarzynski's equality.

Method: The researchers derived the exact work distribution in an expanding relativistic piston model, analyzed the joint distribution of four-vector work, and introduced a geometrical technique for studying relativistic collision processes.

Result: The joint distribution of four-vector work $(W^0, W^1)$ was found to concentrate on the origin and certain curves in the $(W^0, W^1)$ space. The momentum component of the work remains significant in relativistic frameworks, and the non-relativistic limit consistently recovers standard dynamics.

Conclusion: The study confirms the covariant form of Jarzynski's equality in an expanding relativistic piston model. It also highlights the significance of the momentum component of four-vector work in both Lorentz-relativistic and Galilean-relativistic frameworks, while introducing a new geometrical technique for relativistic collision analysis.

Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium four-vector work in an expanding relativistic piston. By deriving the exact work distribution in this pedagogical model, we verify the covariant form of Jarzynski's equality. We find that the joint distribution of four-vector work $(W^0, W^1)$ concentrates on the origin and some curves in the $(W^0, W^1)$ space, rather than being smoothly distributed. In the non-relativistic limit, our model consistently recovers the non-relativistic dynamics. We further demonstrate that the momentum component of four-vector work remains significant in both the Lorentz-relativistic and Galilean-relativistic frameworks. In addition, we introduce a novel geometrical technique for analyzing the dynamics of relativistic collision processes, which can be straightforwardly extended to three-dimensional piston models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the long-standing question of whether the residual entropy of hexagonal ice equals that of cubic ice, which has remained unresolved despite decades of research.

Method: High-precision tensor-network methods are employed, including the use of a projected entangled-pair operator and a split corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm.

Result: Numerical evidence confirms the equality $S_h = S_c$ by analyzing the normality of the transfer operator and directly computing both residual entropies.

Conclusion: The study rigorously supports the equality between the residual entropies of hexagonal ice ($S_h$) and cubic ice ($S_c$) through high-precision tensor-network methods.

Abstract: The long-standing question of whether the residual entropy of hexagonal ice ($S_h$) equals that of cubic ice ($S_c$) remains unresolved despite decades of research on ice-type models. While analytical studies have established the inequality $S_h \geq S_c$, numerical investigations suggest that the two values are very close. In this work, we revisit this problem using high-precision tensor-network methods. In Monte Carlo approaches the residual entropy cannot be directly obtained by sampling the ground-state degeneracy space, however, the tensor-network framework enables an explicit encoding of the "ice rule'' into local tensors, and then the residual entropy is transformed into finding the largest eigenvalue of a transfer operator in the form of a projected entangled-pair operator, which allows high-accuracy numerical evaluation. Meanwhile, we propose a new perspective based on analyzing the normality of the transfer operator, and demonstrate that if the operator is normal, the equality $S_h = S_c$ follows directly. Then the variational tensor network methods are employed to numerically verify this normality. Finally both residual entropies are directly computed by using our recently developed split corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm, providing a rigorous evidence supporting the equality between $S_h$ and $S_c$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) successfully predicts the density of topological defects despite its unclear basis.

Method: Analysis of the Landau-Ginzburg model to explore the role of the temporal evolution of the order parameter in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism.

Result: The study reveals the critical role of the order parameter's temporal evolution in the KZM and proposes novel experimental observables to test its conjecture.

Conclusion: The analytical solutions of the Landau-Ginzburg model suggest new experimental observables that can further validate the KZM's conjecture, enhancing our understanding of symmetry-breaking dynamics.

Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) successfully predicts the density of topological defects deposited by the phase transitions, but it is not clear why. Its key conjecture is that, near the critical point of the second-order phase transition, critical slowing down will result in a period when the system is too sluggish to follow the potential that is changing faster than its reaction time. The correlation length at the freeze-out instant $\hat t$ when the order parameter catches up with the post-transition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well we analyze Landau-Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest novel, hitherto unexplored, experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.

Method: 研究通过分析高斯过程的动态观测值，利用理论模型和模拟（如replica-exchange Wang-Landau模拟）进行验证。

Result: 发现了短相关和长相关高斯过程中的异常标度行为和动态相变，且动态相变的消失与长程相关性有关。

Conclusion: 论文总结了高斯过程中动态观测值的大偏差行为，发现了异常标度行为和动态相变，并通过模拟验证了理论预测。

Abstract: We study large deviations, over a long time window $T \to \infty$, of the dynamical observables $A_n = \int_{0}^{T} x^n(t) dt$, $n=3,4,\dots$, where $x(t)$ is a centered stationary Gaussian process in continuous time. We show that, for short-correlated processes the probability density of $A_n$ exhibits an anomalous scaling $P(A_n,T) \sim \exp[-T^μ f_n(ΔA_n T^{-ν})]$ at $T\to \infty$ while keeping $ΔA_n T^{-ν}$ constant. Here $ΔA_n$ is the deviation of $A_n$ from its ensemble average. The anomalous exponents $μ$ and $ν$ depend on $n$ and are smaller than $1$, whereas the rate function $f_n(z)$ exhibits a first-order dynamical phase transition (DPT) which resembles condensation transitions observed in many systems. The same type of anomaly and DPT, with the same $μ$ and $ν$, was previously uncovered for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process - the only stationary Gaussian process which is also Markovian. We also uncover an anomalous behavior and a similar DPT in the long-correlated Gaussian processes. However, the anomalous exponents $μ$ and $ν$ are determined in this case not only by $n$ but also by the power-law long-time decay $\sim |t|^{-α}$ of the covariance. The different anomalous scaling behavior is a consequence of a faster-than-linear scaling with $T$ of the variance of $A_n$. Finally, for sufficiently long-ranged correlations, $α<2/n$, the DPT disappears, giving way to a smooth crossover between the regions of typical, Gaussian fluctuations and large deviations. The basic mechanism behind the DPT is the existence of strongly localized optimal paths of the process conditioned on very large $A_n$ and coexistence between the localized and delocalized paths of the conditioned process. Our theoretical predictions are corroborated by replica-exchange Wang-Landau simulations where we could probe probability densities down to $10^{-200}$.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore and compare the statistical behaviors of particles under inclusion and exclusion statistics, emphasizing their duality and implications for quantum systems.

Method: The paper employs a historical review approach to trace the development of anyon, exclusion, and inclusion statistics, followed by an analysis of the duality between inclusion and exclusion statistics.

Result: The results include the demonstration of a duality transformation between inclusion and exclusion statistics, generalizing the Bose-Fermi duality, and the application of these concepts in the Calogero model.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with a review of the Calogero model's realization of exclusion statistics and its extension to inclusion statistics, highlighting the duality between these statistical frameworks.

Abstract: We present a historical review of anyon and exclusion statistics, introduced in the 1980s and 1990s respectively, and then turn to developments in the recently introduced inclusion statistics. In contrast to exclusion statistics, where particles tend to be more exclusive than usual fermions, inclusion statistics particles tend to be more gregarious than usual bosons and manifest an enhanced propensity to form condensates. Inclusion and exclusion statistics are related through a duality transformation, generalizing the well-known Bose-Fermi duality. We conclude with a review of the Calogero model realization of exclusion statistics and its extension to inclusion statistics.

TL;DR: The study shows that three-spin interactions boost bipartite entanglement in spin systems, especially near critical points and under dynamic quench conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how three-spin interactions influence bipartite entanglement in spin systems, particularly focusing on critical points and dynamic quench effects.

Method: The research employs the three-spin Ising model to analyze bipartite entanglement, extends it to a generalized central spin model with local coupling, and examines both equilibrium (fixed transverse field) and non-equilibrium (sudden quench) dynamics.

Result: The concurrence exhibits a dip-revival structure in equilibrium and a two-stage fall in non-equilibrium dynamics. Three-spin interactions promote maximal entanglement near multicritical points and enhance entanglement sustainability.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that three-spin interaction enhances the generation of bipartite entanglement between central spins, particularly near critical points and in dynamic quench scenarios.

Abstract: We consider the three-spin Ising model to study the effect of three-spin interacting term on bi-partitie entanglement between adjacent spins. The three-dominated disordered region has tri-partite entanglement causing a vanishingly small concurrence, while it acquires maximum value around the critical points. Considering the above model as an environment, we construct a generalized central spin model where two central spins, initially in an unentangled pure state, are coupled locally to two distinct sites of the environmental spin chain. We study the generation of mixed state entanglement between the central spins when the transverse field of the environment is kept fixed, and suddenly quenched, referring to equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics of the central spins, respectively. For the critical environment in the equilibrium, the concurrence shows a dip-revival structure governed by quasi-particle movement. In the non-equilibrium study, we find an initial growth of concurrence followed by a two-stage fall for the inter-phase quench which is governed by dynamic decoherence channels. The central spins are maximally entangled for a quench in the vicinity of a multicritical point, which arises due to three-spin interaction only. The concurrence becomes long-lived for an intra-phase quench, and this sustainability depends on the strength of the three-spin interaction. Therefore, the three-spin interaction indeed helps in generating bi-partite entanglement in the central spins.

TL;DR: Study of non-Hermitian Anderson localization transitions reveals a universal behavior across different disorder models, with critical exponents determined using a novel LNS method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate the universality of Anderson localization transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems with the skin effect, particularly focusing on different disorder landscapes.

Method: A numerically stable Log-Space Non-Hermitian Scaling (LNS) method was developed to overcome floating-point overflow issues, enabling precision finite-size scaling analysis up to system sizes of L = 1200.

Result: The uniform diagonal model shows a standard mobility edge, while the off-diagonal model exhibits a Dyson-like singularity at the band center. All models share the same universality class upon symmetry breaking.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that all studied models, despite differences in disorder distribution or Hamiltonian structure, belong to the same universality class for non-Hermitian localization transitions. Critical exponents are precisely determined.

Abstract: We investigate the universality of Anderson localization transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the skin effect. By developing a numerically stable Log-Space Non-Hermitian Scaling (LNS) method, we overcome the severe floating-point overflow issues associated with the exponential growth of transmittance (T ~ exp(2 gamma L)), enabling precision finite-size scaling analysis up to system sizes of L = 1200. We probe the critical behavior across three distinct disorder landscapes: uniform diagonal, binary diagonal, and off-diagonal (random hopping) disorder. While the uniform model exhibits a standard mobility edge, the off-diagonal model reveals a Dyson-like singularity at the band center (E = 0), where the system resists localization even at strong disorder due to sublattice symmetry protection. However, upon symmetry breaking (E != 0), we demonstrate that all considered models, regardless of the disorder distribution (continuous vs. discrete) or Hamiltonian structure (site vs. bond randomness), belong to the same robust universality class. The critical exponents are determined as nu = 1.50 +/- 0.00 and beta ~ 0.65 through unambiguous data collapse, establishing a model-independent description of non-Hermitian localization transitions.

TL;DR: Exact description of large deviation rate function and RSB phases for ground-state energy in a disordered model, showing super-concentration and central limit theorem behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the atypical fluctuations of the ground-state energy in a disordered model, particularly focusing on the competition between confinement, elasticity, and disorder, and to characterize the distribution of these fluctuations.

Method: The research employs theoretical analysis and exact calculations to study the large deviation rate function and the phases of replica symmetry breaking (RSB) in the ground-state energy of a disordered model.

Result: The ground-state energy satisfies a central limit theorem with an explicit rescaled variance. In the massless limit, the variance vanishes for short-range disorder, showing super-concentration. The left tail of the typical fluctuations' distribution exhibits an exponential decay for one-step RSB and super-exponential decay with a computed exponent for full RSB.

Conclusion: The study provides an exact description of the large deviation rate function for the ground-state energy of a random elastic manifold, revealing different phases of replica symmetry breaking. It also confirms a central limit theorem for the ground-state energy and quantifies the rescaled variance, with notable findings in the massless limit.

Abstract: We describe the atypical fluctuations of the ground state energy of the random elastic manifold, a disordered model defined on a lattice of linear size $L$ with internal dimension $0\leq d<4$ embedded in a medium of dimension $N\gg 1$. The ground-state energy results from a competition between confinement, elasticity and disorder. We obtain an exact description of the large deviation rate function with speed $NL^d$ and its different phases, corresponding to different patterns of replica symmetry breaking (RSB). Our results show that the ground-state energy satisfies a central limit theorem and we obtain an explicit expression for the rescaled variance. In the (massless) limit of zero confinement, this variance vanishes for short-range disorder and the ground-state energy displays super-concentration. From our results on the large deviation function, we characterise explicitly the left tail of the distribution of the typical fluctuations of the ground state energy. It displays an exponential tail for a one step RSB pattern while for a full RSB pattern it decays super-exponentially with a non trivial exponent $ξ$ that we compute explicitly.

Motivation: To predict the thermal conductivity of simple fluids beyond the dilute-gas limit using a universal thermodynamic approach.

Method: A thermodynamic framework generalizing the transition-rate approach to conserved quantities in continuous space was developed to derive an expression for the thermal conductivity ratio using equilibrium thermodynamic properties.

Result: The framework quantitatively reproduces molecular-dynamics data for hard spheres and captures Lennard-Jones fluids' behavior in the supercritical region, showing good agreement with experimental data for argon.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that transport coefficients of dense fluids can be expressed as their dilute-gas values multiplied by a universal thermodynamic factor, supported by agreement with molecular-dynamics data and experimental results for argon.

Abstract: A thermodynamic framework that predicts the thermal conductivity $λ$ of simple fluids beyond the dilute-gas limit is introduced. By generalizing the transition-rate approach of particles on a lattice to conserved quantities in continuous space, an expression for the ratio $λ/λ_{\rm id}$, with $λ_{\rm id}$ the dilute-gas-limit value, is derived; it depends solely on equilibrium thermodynamic properties and is therefore directly computable from any equation of state. The resulting formula quantitatively reproduces molecular-dynamics data for hard spheres throughout almost the entire fluid range, and captures the behavior of Lennard-Jones fluids in the supercritical region where thermodynamic fluctuations remain moderate. Comparison with experimental data for argon, reported by other authors, also shows very good agreement. These results provide evidence that transport coefficients of dense fluids can be expressed as their dilute-gas values multiplied by a universal thermodynamic factor.

Motivation: To understand how statistical mechanics emerges in isolated quantum many-body systems and generalize the original ETH ansatz.

Method: Uses tools from free probability to explore local rotational invariance and derive analytical characterizations of matrix-element correlations.

Result: Quantitative predictions and analytical characterizations of subleading corrections to matrix-element correlations, linking statistical properties of matrix elements to empirical averages over energy windows.

Conclusion: The paper revisits and refines the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) by introducing full ETH to account for multi-point correlation functions, validated through numerical simulations in non-integrable Floquet systems.

Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) was developed as a framework for understanding how the principles of statistical mechanics emerge in the long-time limit of isolated quantum many-body systems. Since then, ETH has shifted the attention towards the study of matrix elements of physical observables in the energy eigenbasis. In this work, we revisit recent developments leading to the formulation of full ETH, a generalization of the original ETH ansatz that accounts for multi-point correlation functions. Using tools from free probability, we explore the implications of local rotational invariance, a property that emerges from the statistical invariance of observables under random basis transformations induced by small perturbations of the Hamiltonian. This approach allows us to make quantitative predictions and derive an analytical characterization of subleading corrections to matrix-element correlations, thereby refining the ETH ansatz. Moreover, our analysis links the statistical properties of matrix elements under random basis changes to the empirical averages over energy windows that are usually considered when dealing with a single instance of the ensemble. We validate our analytical predictions through comparison with numerical simulations in non-integrable Floquet systems.
