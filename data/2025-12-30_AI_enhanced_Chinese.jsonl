In such systems, standard Bell tests based on dichotomic projective measurements are not directly applicable, raising the question of how quantum nonlocality can be certified from continuous time-series data. Here we develop a general theoretical framework showing that Bell-CHSH inequality violation can be extracted from continuous, non-projective measurements without assuming any specific collapse model or phase distribution. We show that sufficiently long continuous measurements of a single entangled pair sample its internal phase-probability structure, enabling effective dichotomic observables to be constructed through phase-sensitive projections and coarse-graining. The resulting Bell correlator is governed by two experimentally accessible resources: intrinsic single-qubit phase spread and nonlocal phase locking between qubits. We benchmark the resulting estimator against conventional projective-measurement CHSH tests implemented via quantum-circuit simulations using Qiskit, finding quantitative agreement in the Bell-violating regime without parameter fitting. Classical deterministic correlations cannot violate the CHSH bound, whereas quantum phase-locked systems recover the nonlinear angular dependence characteristic of entanglement.

The monolayer-trilayer phase develops incommensurate magnetic order below approximately 150 K, with a mean ordering temperature of $T_{SDW} \\simeq 123$ K and a transition width of $\u0394T_{SDW} \\simeq 15$ K.

Hydrostatic pressure ($p$) suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature at a rate of $dT_{SDW}/d p \\simeq -3.9$ K/GPa, demonstrating a progressive destabilization of the ordered state.

This separation between conditional collapse and ensemble invariance leads to a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is transient and continuously counteracted by dissipation and drive. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and show-that it holds over a finite range of measurement strengths.

We perform a comprehensive numerical study of the PMG under two families of microscopic decision rules: (i) agents update their choices based on instantaneous population in their alternative choices, and (ii) threshold-based activation that activates agents movement only after overcrowding density crossing a threshold. We measure time-dependent and steady state limits of activity $A(t)$, overcrowding fraction $F(t)$ as functions of the control parameter $g=N/D$, where $N$ is the number of agents and $D$ is the total number of sites. Instantaneous rules display mean-field directed-percolation (MF-DP) scaling with $\u03b2\\approx1.00$, $\u03b4\\approx0.5$, and $\u03bd_{\\parallel}\\approx2.0$. Threshold rules, however, produce a distinct non-mean-field universality class with $\u03b2\\approx0.75$ and a systematic failure of MF-DP dynamical scaling.

First-principles calculations confirm that these compounds are non-magnetic metals, among which four are dynamically stable: CaNb5, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3.

Furthermore, by applying the method of symmetry indicators, we systematically classify the topological and nodal characteristics of CaNb5, providing valuable insights for determining its superconducting pairing symmetry.

In quasi-one-dimensional systems, equilibrium photoemission studies have reported signatures of trions, suggesting an unusually robust state, as opposed to conventional semiconductors where trions typically appear only as excited states stabilized by carrier doping. Here, we show that optical excitation of undoped Ta2NiS5 - a correlated quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor - generates a pronounced and long-lived trion population, demonstrating that such states can be dynamically induced even in the absence of doping. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we track the dynamics of a bright, localized in-gap state that emerges following photoexcitation and identify it as a transient trion population. We uncover an unconventional trion formation pathway and a fluence-dependent competition between trions and excitons.

Characterizing these defects is an important step towards reducing their impact and improving qubit coherence. The identification of individual defects requires atomic-scale spatial resolution, however, and sufficient spectral sensitivity to determine their electronic structure. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) provides highly resolved maps of the surface potential of dielectrics, and importantly, is also sensitive to single-electron charging processes that reflect the spectral structure of underlying defects. In this work, we use cryogenic EFM to characterize aluminum oxide grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on bulk silicon.

Detailed electrostatic modeling opens the door to powerful techniques for mapping tip-backgate charging voltages onto defect transition energies, allowing defects such as aluminum vacancies, and carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen impurities to be identified, by comparing to density functional theory (DFT).

This work introduces a novel theoretical framework based on Quantum Phase Space (QPS) to address the dual challenge of characterizing environment-selected pointer states and modeling decoherence dynamics across different regimes. Within this framework, pointer states for particle motion are identified as the minimum-uncertainty states, those that saturate the quantum uncertainty relation, thereby constituting the closest quantum analogue to classical phase-space points. The structure of the QPS, encoded in a variance-covariance matrix, is shown to be directly shaped by environmental properties. A time-independent matrix corresponds to Markovian (memoryless) decoherence, described by constant diffusion and friction coefficients, while a time-dependent matrix captures non-Markovian dynamics, characterized by environmental memory and information backflow. This unified geometric formalism, applied to both Lindblad and Non-Markovian master equations, enables us to derive explicit relations between environmental parameters and phase-space structure, as demonstrated in a specific illustrative example. This approach has the potential to serve as a powerful tool for modeling decoherence in nanoscience and could inform new principles for designing mitigation strategies and harnessing non-Markovian effects for quantum technologies. The QPS framework may thus bridge fundamental theory and practical quantum engineering, offering a promising coherent pathway to understand, control, and exploit decoherence at the nanoscience frontier.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08QPS\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u63cf\u8ff0\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u4e2d\u6307\u9488\u6001\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4e3a\u7eb3\u7c73\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u73af\u5883\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u9488\u6001\uff08\u786e\u5b9a\u4e3a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6001\uff09\uff1b2) \u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u7a81\u7834\u70b9\uff1a\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "QPS\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5dee-\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7f16\u7801\u73af\u5883\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u65e0\u5173\u77e9\u9635/\u6052\u5b9a\u6269\u6563-\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\uff09\u4e0e\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u77e9\u9635/\u4fe1\u606f\u56de\u6d41\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408Lindblad\u548c\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u73af\u5883\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "1) \u6307\u9488\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u9971\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6001\uff1b2) \u73af\u5883\u53c2\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u51b3\u5b9aQPS\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u5177\u4f53\u7b97\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u73af\u5883-\u76f8\u4f4d\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u673a\u5236\u3002\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\uff1a\u6307\u5bfc\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6548\u5e94\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u5f15\u8a00\uff09\uff1a\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u73b0\u8c61\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff1a\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08QPS\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u73af\u5883\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u9488\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u9000\u76f8\u5e72\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u7b2c\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u7ed3\u679c\uff09\uff1a\u6307\u9488\u6001\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u6027\u3001\u76f8\u4f4d\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff08\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b/\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u52a8\u6001\uff09\u3002\u7b2c\u56db\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u610f\u4e49\uff09\uff1a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7eb3\u7c73\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

A Fisher-information regularization term generates the quantum potential, yielding the Schr\u00f6dinger equation when the optimality system is expressed in complex form. Unlike standard Bohmian mechanics, which requires an auxiliary Quantum Equilibrium Hypothesis ($P = |\u03c8|^2$), our primal-dual formulation satisfies the Born rule by construction.

For overdamped Langevin systems, the geometric decomposition of information flow into excess and housekeeping contributions is related to the conventional definition of the $2$-Wasserstein distance between marginal distributions in optimal transport theory. This formulation offers an optimal-transport interpretation of subsystem dynamics, and this optimal-transport formulation is simpler for overdamped Langevin systems than for general Markov jump systems. It is also possible to handle features that are specific to overdamped Langevin systems, such as representations based on the Koopman mode decomposition, as well as their relationship with the Fisher information matrix. As with the results for Markov jump systems, we generalize the second law of information thermodynamics using housekeeping and excess information flow, leading to the concept of excess and housekeeping demons.

The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir > U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties.

Once the minimal structure needed to measure constant -- energy manifolds is made explicit, the microcanonical measure emerges as the natural hypersurface measure on each energy shell. Thermodynamics becomes the study of how these shells deform with energy: the entropy is the logarithm of a geometric area, and its derivatives satisfy a deterministic hierarchy of entropy flow equations driven by microcanonical averages of curvature invariants (built from the shape/Weingarten operator and related geometric data). Within this framework, phase transitions correspond to qualitative reorganizations of the geometry of energy manifolds, leaving systematic signatures in the derivatives of the entropy.\n  Two general structural consequences follow.

These elements establish the conditions required for spin polarization in the absence of external magnetic field at finite superconducting phase bias. This Hamiltonian has been previously used to model the Andreev spin qubit, where quantum information is encoded in spinful odd-parity subgap states. Here we instead analyse the even-parity sector, i.e., the Andreev pair qubit based on Andreev bound states (ABS). The model is solved using the zero-bandwidth approximation and the numerical renormalization group, with further insight from variational calculations.

We consider a model of two continuum polymerized membranes, separated by a distance $\\ell$, in their flat phase, coupled by interlayer shear, compression/dilatation and elastic terms. Within a controlled truncation of the effective average action, we retain only the contributions that generate a pronounced crossover of the effective bending rigidity along the renormalization group flow between two regimes: at high running scale $k$, the rigidity is dominated by the in-plane elastic properties, with $\u03ba_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\sim \\ell^{2}(\u03bb+2\u03bc)/2$, whereas at low $k$ it is controlled by the bending rigidity of two independent monolayers, $\u03ba_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\sim 2\u03ba$. This crossover is reminiscent of that observed by Mauri et al. as a function of the wavevector scale $q$, but here it is obtained within a renormalization group framework. This has several advantages. First, although approximations are performed, the NPRG approach allows one, in principle, to take into account all nonlinearities present in the elastic theory, in contrast to the SCSA treatment which requires, already at the formal level, significant simplifications.

We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect.

Extracting low-energy predictions from such simulations rely on formulating systematically-improvable representations of lattice gauge theory Hamiltonians that are efficient at all values of the gauge coupling. One such candidate representation for SU(2) is the fully gauge-fixed Hamiltonian defined in the mixed basis. This work focuses on the quantum simulation of the smallest non-trivial system: two plaquettes with open boundary conditions. A mapping of the continuous gauge field degrees of freedom to qubit-based representations is developed. It is found that as few as three qubits per plaquette is sufficient to reach per-mille level precision on predictions for observables. Two distinct algorithms for implementing time evolution in the mixed basis are developed and analyzed in terms of quantum resource estimates. One algorithm has favorable scaling in circuit depth for large numbers of qubits, while the other is more practical when qubit count is limited. The latter algorithm is used in the measurement of a real-time observable on IBM's Heron superconducting quantum processor, ibm_fez.

Efficiently measuring these high dimensional states is challenging due to the large number of measurements required for reconstructing the full density matrix via quantum state tomography (QST), and the fact that each measurement requires some modification in the experimental setup. Here, we propose a framework for reconstructing the density matrix of a single-photon hyperentangled across multiple DOFs using a single intensity-measurement obtainable from traditional cameras, and discuss extensions for multiphoton hyperentangled states.

Comment on arXiv:2512.18400", "summary": "In a recent preprint [1] Jeffrey Bub presents a discussion of neo-Bohrian interpretations of quantum mechanics, and also of von Neumann's work on infinite tensor products [2]. He rightfully writes that this work provides a theoretical framework that deflates the measurement problem and justifies Bohr's insistence on the primacy of classical concepts. But then he rejects these ideas, on the basis that the infinity limit is \"never reached for any real system composed of a finite number of elementary systems\". In this note we present opposite views on two major points: first, admitting mathematical infinities in a physical theory is not a problem, if properly done; second, the critics of [3,4,5] comes with a major misunderstanding of these papers: they don't ask about \"the significance of the transition from classical to quantum mechanics\", but they start from a physical ontology where classical and quantum physics need each other from the beginning. This is because they postulate that a microscopic physical object (or degree of freedom) always appears as a quantum system, within a classical context.

We analytically and numerically study the stabilizer entropy gap or magic gap: the average gap between the SE of a quantum state realized within a subspace of a larger system and the SE of the quantum state considered on its own. We find that while the stabilizer entropy gap is typically positive, requiring the injection of magic, both zero and negative magic gaps are achievable. This suggests that certain choices of embedding subspace provide strong resource advantages over others. We provide formulas for the average nonstabilizerness of a subspace given its corresponding projector and sufficient conditions for realizing zero or negative gaps: in particular, certain classes of stabilizer codes provide paradigmatic examples of the latter.

In parallel, strong-field physics provides widely tunable, bright coherent radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), but its quantum optical character has remained largely unexplained. While recent experiments have revealed signatures of entanglement, squeezing, and quantum-state modification in both the driving and generated fields, a unified theoretical framework capable of identifying the origin and controllability of these effects has been missing. Here we introduce a fully quantum, analytically tractable theory of intense light-matter interaction that rigorously captures the emergence of nonclassicality in HHG. Our approach employs a parametric factorization of the coupled electron-field system into a driven electronic state and a dynamically perturbed quantum optical field, derived directly from the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation without requiring conditioning, homodyne detection, or mode-selection techniques. We show how quantum correlations, squeezing, and Wigner-function negativity arise intrinsically from the interaction dynamics, and we identify the precise conditions under which specific nonclassical features are amplified or suppressed. The theory enables predictive design of bright, high-photon-number quantum states at tunable frequencies, and we demonstrate its utility by outlining realistic conditions for generating bright nonclassical ultraviolet light.

Our approach provides a unified framework that connects both limiting cases while offering a clear conceptual picture suitable for advanced quantum mechanics courses.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The inequality is valid for all states on the Poincar\u00e9-Bloch sphere, but few laboratory studies have investigated violations with the full sphere. In this article, we explore the experimental verifications of the predicted violations of the CHSH inequality with Bell and non-Bell states with same and different linear and elliptically polarized basis states for each photon. We find that Bell states violate CHSH when using the same basis for both photons, regardless of their ellipticity, whereas they show no violations for photon projections in different bases. We found non-Bell maximally-entangled states for which the converse is true.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Twirling, uniform averaging over symmetry actions, is a standard tool for reducing the description of quantum states and channels to symmetry-invariant data. We develop a framework for averaging quantum channels based on channel-state duality that converts pre- and post-processing averages into a group twirl acting directly on the Choi operator. For arbitrary unitary representations on the input and output spaces, the twirled channel is obtained as an explicit projection onto the commutant of the induced representation on $\\mathcal H_{\\rm out}\\otimes \\mathcal H_{\\rm in}$. In the collective setting, where the commutant is the walled Brauer algebra, we introduce a partial-transpose reduction that maps channel twirling to an ordinary Schur-Weyl twirl of the partially transposed Choi operator, enabling formulas in terms of permutation operators. We further extend the construction beyond compact symmetries to reductive non-unitary groups via Cartan decomposition, yielding a weighted sum of invariant-sector projections with weights determined by the Abelian component. Finally, we provide two finite realizations of channel averaging. The first one is a ``dual'' averaging protocol as a convex mixture of unitary-$1$-design channels on invariant sectors. The second one is a notion of channel $t$-designs induced by weighted group $t$-designs for $t=t_{\\rm in}+t_{\\rm out}$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Any consistent description of such scenarios must avoid time-travel paradoxes while respecting the no-new-physics principle, which requires that the set of operations available within any local spacetime region remain unchanged, irrespective of whether CTCs exist elsewhere. Within an information-theoretic framework, this leads to process functions: deterministic classical communication structures that remain logically consistent under arbitrary local operations, yet can exhibit correlations incompatible with any definite causal order - a phenomenon known as non-causality. In this work, we provide the first complete recursive characterization of process functions and of (non-)causal process functions. We use it to establish a correspondence between process functions and unambiguous complete product bases, i.e., product bases in which every local state belongs to a unique local basis. This equivalence implies that non-causality of process functions is exactly mirrored by quantum nonlocality without entanglement (QNLWE) - the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing separable states using local operations and causal classical communication - for such bases. Our results generalize previous special cases to arbitrary local dimensions and any number of parties, enable systematic constructions of non-causal process functions and unambiguous QNLWE bases, and reveal an unexpected connection between certain non-signaling inequalities and causal inequalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Squeezed magnon states arise naturally as the equilibrium ground states of anisotropic ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, representing an important class of nonclassical magnon states. In this work, we show how a qubit-conditioned quantum quench of an anisotropic ferromagnet can be used for Heisenberg-limited parameter estimation based on measurements of the qubit only. In the presence of ground-state squeezing, the protocol yields information about the eigenmode frequency of the coupled magnon-qubit system, whereas no information is gained in the absence of such squeezing. The protocol therefore leverages genuine quantum correlations in the form of magnonic squeezing while simultaneously relying on the equilibrium character of this squeezing -- a feature distinctive to magnetic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These systems enable mapping of arbitrary phases via interference rotation and offer a platform to measure Berry phase.

In this paper, we establish a unified framework in the form of operational no-signalling constraints to study both nonlocal and temporal correlations within general relativistic spacetimes. We explore several intriguing consequences arising from our framework. Firstly, we show that the violation of the operational no-signalling constraints in Minkowski spacetime implies either a logical paradox or an operational infringement of Poincar\u00e9 symmetry. We thereby examine and subvert recent claims in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 110401 (2022)] on the possibility of witnessing operationally detectable causal loops in Minkowski spacetime. Secondly, we explore the possibility of jamming of nonlocal correlations, controverting a recent claim in [Nat. Comm. 16, 269 (2025)] that a physical mechanism for jamming would necessarily lead to superluminal signalling. Finally, we show that in black hole spacetimes certain nonlocal correlations under and across the event horizon can be jammed by any agent without spoiling the operational no-signalling constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
