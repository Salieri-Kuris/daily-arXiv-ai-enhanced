It is proven that the unique set of eigenfunctions or preferred basis exists for any non-isolated sub-system. Applying the new eigenvalue equation to the relative motion of a hydrogen atom together with the derived relativistic Hamiltonian to quantify the impact of finite proton mass to the fine structure, correction to the fine structure is obtained as a result of the entanglement of the relative motion and the center-of-mass motion, which can be used to verify the correctness of the proposed eigenvalue equation. Applying the equation to the measurement of electron double-slit interference, it is analyzed that the photon packets with Lorentzian spectral lineshape, the domain and state density of the sub-system, and the energy of the incident electron together determines the spontaneous emission rate of the incident electron. Photons generated in this process excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction band of the detector. Corresponding to any emitted or absorbed photon, the sub-system is found to be uniquely determined by maximizing the transition rate. This new principle is valid for atoms too. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the transition rates and example numerical results show good correlation between calculation and the position measurement experiment. The discovered common mechanisms that determine the sub-systems, the preferred bases, and transition rates form the foundation of a new, general, and consistent theory of quantum measurement."}

We introduce and clarify various definitions of robustness and accuracy, including corrupted-instance robustness accuracy and prediction-change robustness, distinguishing them from conventional accuracy and robustness measures. Through theoretical analysis and toy models, we establish conditions under which trade-offs between accuracy and robustness accuracy arise and identify scenarios where such trade-offs can be avoided. The framework developed highlights the nuanced interplay between model bias, noise characteristics, and perturbation types, including relevant and irrelevant perturbations. We explore the implications of some of these results for incompatible noise, adversarial quantum perturbations, the no free lunch theorem, and suggest future methods to examine these problems from the lens of dynamical systems."}

We begin by embedding the physical qubit subspace into the space of holomorphic functions that are homogeneous of degree one in each Schwinger boson pair $(z_{a_{j}}, z_{b_{j}})$. Within this framework, we derive explicit closed-form differential operator representations for a universal set of quantum gates--including the Pauli operators, Hadamard, CNOT, CZ, and SWAP--and demonstrate that they preserve the physical subspace exactly. Restricting to unit-magnitude variables ($|z| = 1$) reveals a toroidal space $\\mathbb{T}^{2N}$, on which quantum gates act as canonical transformations: Pauli operators generate Hamiltonian flows, the Hadamard gate induces a nonlinear automorphism, and entangling gates produce correlated diffeomorphisms that couple distinct toroidal factors. Beyond the torus, the full Segal--Bargmann space carries a natural Kaehler geometry that governs amplitude dynamics. Entanglement is geometrically characterized via the Segre embedding into complex projective space, while topological protection arises from the $U(1)^{N}$ fiber bundle structure associated with the Jordan--Schwinger constraint."}

Based on the doubly differential measurement of the spin density matrix of the top quark and antiquark performed by the CMS collaboration in the helicity and beam bases, we evaluate a set of quantum observables, including discord, steering, Bell correlation, and magic. These observables allow for a quantitative characterization of the quantum correlations present in a top quark--antiquark system, thus enabling an interpretation of collider data in terms of quantum states and their properties. Discord is observed to be greater than zero with a significance of more than 5 standard deviations ($σ$). Evidence for steering is found with a significance of more than 3$σ$. This is the first evidence for steering, and the first observation of discord in a high-energy system. No Bell correlation is observed within the currently probed phase space, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. These results experimentally corroborate the full hierarchy of quantum correlations in top quarks with discord being the most basic form of quantum correlation, followed by entanglement, steering and Bell correlation. The significance of nonzero magic, which is a complementary observable to the quantum-correlation hierarchy, is found to exceed 5$σ$ in several regions of phase space."}

The average number of photons radiated by a charged particle passing through a plate made of this metamaterial is obtained. Given the positions of the transition radiation maxima in momentum space for different velocities of a charged particle, the method for reconstruction of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in metamaterials is proposed. Applying this method conversely, one can predict the radiation spectrum and polarization properties of transition radiation by means of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in the metamaterial known, for example, from the effective model. It is shown that the strong spatial dispersion alters qualitatively the properties of transition radiation from a charged particle traversing normally a plate made of the helical metamaterial along its symmetry axis in the paraxial regime, viz., there is a nonzero forward radiation in contrast to transition radiation in media without strong spatial dispersion. Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation and the anomalous Doppler effect in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion are described."}

Yet, the product states typically only span parts of a larger degenerate eigenspace. Here, we classify this eigenspace in the one-dimensional periodic XXZ chain at all roots of unity $q$, where $q^2$ is an $\\ell$-th primitive root of unity. For commensurate chain lengths $N$ with $q^N=1$, we prove that the minimal degeneracy is $2^{N/\\ell}\\ell$ using the representation theory of the affine Temperley-Lieb (aTL) algebra. For the incommensurate case, we derive analogous exponential lower bounds of $2^{2\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2\\ell}\\rfloor+1}$ if $N$ is even and $2^{2\\lfloor \\frac{N}{2\\ell}+\\frac{1}{2}\\rfloor}$ if $N$ is odd and $q^\\ell=1$. Our proof employs the morphisms between aTL modules discovered by Pinet and Saint-Aubin and emphasizes the importance of exact sequences and hidden twisted boundary condition sectors that mediate the degeneracy. In the case of commensurate chain lengths, we connect to the Fabricius-McCoy string construction of all Bethe roots of the degenerate subspace, which previously uncovered parts of our results. We corroborate our results numerically and demonstrate that the lower bound is saturated for chain lengths $N\\leq20$. Our work demonstrates for a concrete system how the interplay of the Bethe ansatz, aTL representation theory, and twisted boundary conditions explains degeneracy connected to long-lived product states, stimulating research towards generalization to higher dimensions. Exponential degeneracy could boost applications of spin chains as quantum sensors."}

Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) with orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based electron state sorting has been suggested as a suitable candidate, but to date, no conclusive experiments have been performed. We, therefore, theoretically explore the emergence of dichroism in EELS for a canonical single-twist helix nanostructure and present a detailed analysis of the optimal parameters to obtain a robust signal.

Here we demonstrate a data-driven workflow that integrates pixel-wise spectral deconvolution with machine-learning (ML) to analyze tunneling spectroscopy from FeTe0.55Se0.45, an intrinsic TSC. Based on the local density of states (LDOS) spectra acquired with a millikelvin scanning tunnelling microscope under magnetic fields, each spectrum was decomposed into multiple Lorentzian peaks. The extracted peak parameters were assembled into a structured feature set and subsequently embedded and clustered with unsupervised ML algorithms. ML-based clustering identified distinct classes of LDOS spectra, separating superconductor vortices exhibiting ZBPs consistent with established characteristics of MZMs from vortices displaying ZBP-mimicking features of trivial origin. Furthermore, spatially resolved ZBP distributions differentiate isotropic vortex cores with well-defined ZBPs from vortices that exhibit locally distorted ZBPs. By comparing the ZBP distributions to defect locations measured without magnetic field, we found a correlation between local heterogeneity and the ZBP formation, necessitating the systematic, data-driven analysis in disentangling genuine MZM signatures in TSC. This objective and reproducible workflow paves the way to further manipulating MZMs in TSC. This objective and reproducible workflow advances reliable MZM detection in TSCs, providing a foundation for MZM manipulation towards quantum computation."}

Integrating out matter fields to quadratic order yields an explicit Ioffe-Larkin composition rule for the full resistivity tensor, showing how longitudinal channels add in series while Chern-Simons terms generate Hall response. To obtain the DC limit in the quantum critical fan, we develop a controlled large-N expansion where both fermion flavors and Chern-Simons levels scale with $N$, and solve a quantum Boltzmann equation at leading nontrivial order $1/N$.

Both are investigated by extending the framework of quantum generalized hydrodynamics to account for the underlying stochastic dynamics. We derive the evolution of the local quasiparticle occupation function, which characterizes the system at large space-time scales, and analyze the resulting entanglement spreading.

In this paper, we propose a high-dimensional superdense coding protocol using energy-time entangled states. These states are biphoton frequency combs, an example of entangled time-frequency Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (TFGKP) states or time-frequency grid states. Inspired by GKP codes, our protocol involves discretizing the continuous time and frequency degrees of freedom and encoding information by time-frequency displacements. This approach leverages the inherently large Hilbert space found in quantum frequency combs, with resilience against both temporal and spectral errors. In addition to describing the theoretical structure of the protocol, we propose an experimental implementation using standard telecommunication components, time-resolving single-photon detectors and a frequency beamsplitter. We also analyze the effect of experimental noise and errors on the channel capacity of the protocol. We demonstrate that for realistic experimental parameters, contemporary technologies satisfy the prerequisites for superdense coding with biphoton frequency combs, achieving a transmission rate of approximately 8.91 bits per transmitted photon (equivalent to 481 distinguishable messages with asymptotically vanishing errors). This more than doubles the previously highest transmission rate of 4 bits achieved by the Kwiat-Weinfurter scheme, while also having competitive optical loss. Furthermore, our results beat the rate achievable using a single-photon frequency comb with identical parameters by 4.6 times. Our protocol thus represents an experimentally feasible application of time-frequency grid states to entanglement-assisted communication, contributing to the active fields of continuous-variable and high-dimensional quantum information."}

This leads to asymmetric critical currents for opposite current polarities, an effect absent in the same junction without microwave irradiation. The asymmetry is highly tunable via the microwave amplitude and frequency, and we may even achieve perfect asymmetry where the critical current vanishes for one polarity, akin to a perfect diode. While Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states provide the ideal platform for a pronounced asymmetry, we find that as long as the two conditions (i) and (ii) above are met, our proposal does not necessarily depend upon them."}

Ba4Ir3O10 has a quasi-2D structure composed of buckled sheets, which constitute corner-connected Ir3O12 trimers containing three distorted face-sharing IrO6 octahedra. The Ir atoms are distributed over two symmetrically inequivalent sites: the center of the trimer (Ir1) and its two tips (Ir2). The Ir1 - Ir2 distance within the trimer is quite small and equals to 2.58 A at low temperature. As a result, the clear formation of bonding and antibonding states at the Ir1 site occurs. The large bonding-antibonding splitting stabilizes the dyz-orbital-dominant antibonding state of t2g holes and produces a wide energy gap at the Fermi level. However, the energy gap opens up only with taking into account strong Coulomb correlations at the Ir2 site. Therefore, we have quite a unique situation when the insulating state is driven by both the dimerization at the Ir1 site and Mott insulating behavior at the Ir2 one. We have investigated resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra at the Ir L3 edge. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data. The RIXS spectrum possesses several sharp features below 2.1 eV corresponding to transitions within the Ir t2g levels. The excitation located from 2.1 to 4.6 eV is due to t2g to eg and O2p to t2g transitions. The wide structure situated at 6.2-12 eV appears due to charge transfer and O2p to eg transitions.

Distortion is introduced through controlled random displacements of lattice sites, thereby modifying nearest-neighbor distances. Bond occupation is permitted only when the bond length is smaller than a prescribed connection threshold, directly coupling geometric disorder to connectivity. Finite-size scaling analysis is employed to determine percolation thresholds for finite systems and in the thermodynamic limit. We find that when the connection threshold exceeds the nearest-neighbor distance of the undistorted lattice, the percolation threshold increases monotonically with distortion strength, indicating a systematic suppression of spanning. In contrast, this monotonic behavior breaks down when the connection threshold is below the nearest-neighbor distance of the undistorted lattice, highlighting a nontrivial interplay between geometric distortion and connectivity. We further identify critical values of the connection threshold and the distortion amplitude required for global spanning when all the allowed bonds are occupied. All qualitative behaviors remain robust across both lattice geometries. These results clarify how geometric disorder reshapes percolation in three-dimensional crystalline networks."}

This establishes that a structural phase transition can be detected via a high-resolution measurement of the photoemission threshold.

With increasing out-of-plane displacement field, a geometrically frustrated Mott insulator evolves into a ferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) Mott insulator, i.e., a spin-polarized topological Mott insulator without an observable charge-gap closure, and subsequently into an antiferromagnetic, valley-coherent Mott insulator (VC-AFM) accompanied by a continuous charge-gap collapse and the emergence of a critical metallic state. Layer-resolved magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), magneto-transport, and compressibility measurements jointly determine the phase diagram. The high-field evolution of the antiferromagnetic state reveals a metamagnetic-like transition at a critical field B*, above which a Chern insulating transport response reappears. Our results establish the MoTe2/WSe2 moire platform as a tunable realization of an extended Kane-Mele-Hubbard model hosting sequential correlation-topology-intertwined transitions."}

We investigate the ``structural complexity'' of the 2D ferromagnetic Ising model, a paradigmatic system exhibiting a second-order phase transition at a certain critical temperature which is often cited as a canonical example of complex morphology. We define a quantitative metric for this structural complexity, $\\mathcal C_s$, through the lens of algorithmic information theory by approximating the Kolmogorov complexity of lattice configurations via standard lossless image compression algorithms. We regularize our proposed metric, $\\mathcal C_s$, by comparing the compressibility of a configuration to that of its pixel-wise sorted and randomly shuffled counterparts. We arrive at a definition of $\\mathcal C_s$ as a product of two components representing the systems departure from perfect order and disorder respectively which we then plot as a function of temperature. Our numerical simulations reveal a distinct peak in $\\mathcal C_s$ at the known critical temperature $T_c$. This result demonstrates that such information-theoretic measures can act as sensitive, model-agnostic indicators of criticality, directly quantifying the emergence of complex structure at the boundary between order and chaos, opening the door to data-driven applications in domains where analytic solutions are unavailable."}

We mitigate these limitations by using supervised learning to approximate the minimum description length of residual unitaries and combining this estimate with stochastic beam search to identify near optimal gate sequences. Our method relies on a lightweight model with zero-shot generalization, substantially reducing training overhead compared to prior baselines.

In the compound Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, the main electronic bands closely resemble those of pristine 2H-TaS$_2$, with no clear signs of band folding. However, a shallow electron pocket, referred to as the $β$-feature, was detected at the Fermi level near the corner of the superlattice Brillouin zone. The surface vs bulk origin of this feature is debated, as it cannot be reproduced using standard DFT calculations. To resolve this, we employed cluster perturbation theory (CPT) to incorporating an exact treatment of strong electron correlations (U) on the cobalt sites, going beyond DFT+U approximation. To further substantiate this, we studied an underdoped sample, Co$_{0.22}$TaS$_2$, where a reduced charge transfer leads to different Co orbital character near the Fermi level. We find that its electronic structure closely resembles that of undoped 2H-TaS$_2$, and crucially, lacks the $β$-feature. Our results demonstrate that the $β$-feature is of the bulk origin emerging from the strong electronic correlations where both the Co charge state and long-range crystallographic order play an important role. This work highlights the need for accurate treatment of electron correlations when studying intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides."}

The core is a mirror-state construction: for any microstate $A$ one constructs its time-reversed partner $B$ (momenta inverted). If a universal monotonicity statement is applied to both $A$ and $B$, it implies that $A$ is a local minimum of entropy at every moment, which forces entropy to be constant and destroys any entropic arrow of time. The consistent replacement is that entropy is a stochastic variable described by a probability distribution $P(S)$, whose shape depends on constraints and boundary conditions. We then prove from first principles that constraints necessarily reshape the long-time entropy distribution $P_{\\infty}(S;λ)$ by altering the invariant measure through changes in the Hamiltonian and/or the accessible phase space. A sharp criterion is given: in the microcanonical setting, the \\emph{only} way $P_{\\infty}^{(E)}(S;λ)$ can remain the same up to translation is when all accessible macrostate volumes are scaled by a common factor; otherwise the distribution changes structurally."}

Building on the framework introduced in Gunn et al., Phys. Rev. B 111, 115110 (2025), we extend the analysis from abelian and class-2 nilpotent groups to all finite nilpotent groups. For any such symmetry group $G$, we construct explicit protocols composed of $G$-symmetric circuits and measurements with feedforward that transform symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states into the trivial phase and vice versa using a finite number of measurement rounds determined by the nilpotency class of $G$. Although these transformations are approximate, we prove that their success probability converges to unity in the thermodynamic limit, establishing asymptotically deterministic equivalence. Consequently, all SPT phases protected by finite nilpotent groups collapse to a single phase once symmetric measurements and feedforward are allowed. We further show that the same holds for non-normal MPS with long-range correlations, including GHZ-type states. The central technical ingredient is a hierarchical structure of irreducible representations of nilpotent groups, which enables a recursive reduction of non-abelian components to abelian ones. Our results demonstrate that symmetric measurements lead to a complete collapse of both symmetry-protected and non-normal MPS phases for all finite nilpotent symmetry groups."}

Suspended TMD monolayers provide an effective route to minimizing substrate-induced disorder. Here we demonstrate the spatially uniform excitonic spectrum from high-quality WSe2 suspended monolayers fabricated by gold-assisted exfoliation directly onto an Au contact electrode of a gate-tunable device. The resulting membranes span narrow suspended regions up to ~80 um and show spatially uniform photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures with neutral-exciton linewidths as low as ~4.5 meV, comparable to the narrowest values reported for high-quality monolayers. Spectral reproducibility across the suspended regions supports an intrinsic optical response, while gate-dependent measurements resolve multiple excitonic species. This approach provides a practical route to electrically tunable potential landscapes in suspended TMD monolayers with a highly uniform excitonic response."}

Upon dosing the dopants to Mott-insulating Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we found a new Ru $3d$ photoemission peak emerging on the lower binding-energy side, suggesting the creation of a core-hole screening channel associated with coherent Ru $4d$ states around the Fermi level.

The coherent state, therefore, develops within the Mott gap through hybridization with the impurity level of the dopants.

In generalized LPFET (gLPFET), the embedding clusters are designed from a full-size gKS system where the (in-principle non-local) Hartree-Fock exchange potential is combined with a local (in the localized orbital representation) correlation potential. The latter is optimized self-consistently such that gKS and local embedding cluster's densities match. Unlike in DMET, which uses the same (global) chemical potential value in all clusters, each embedded orbital has its own chemical potential in gLPFET. We show analytically that, when electron correlation is strongly local, the latter potential becomes a simple functional of the correlation potential. Numerical calculations on model systems confirm the high accuracy of gLPFET in this regime, in contrast to DMET. Moreover, we show that gLPFET completely fixes the flaw of LPFET in weaker correlation regimes, through its appropriate description of the Hartree-exchange potential."}

This provides the first controlled quantum realization in three dimensions where gauge theories of different rank emerge within a single microscopic spin Hamiltonian.

The heavy-tailed resets generate magnetisation distributions that differ significantly from both equilibrium dynamics and the previously studied Ising model with exponentially distributed reset times. In two dimensions, for $T > T_C$, we find a quasi-ferro state for all $α$, marked by a double-peaked distribution that diverges at $m=0$ and $m=m_0$; no steady state exists for $α< 1$, while a stationary state emerges for $α> 1$.

This leads to asymmetric critical currents for opposite current polarities, an effect absent in the same junction without microwave irradiation. The asymmetry is highly tunable via the microwave amplitude and frequency, and we may even achieve perfect asymmetry where the critical current vanishes for one polarity, akin to a perfect diode.

Our results demonstrate that both the charging energy and ergotropy of the quantum batteries can be significantly enhanced within the ultra-strong coupling regime and across a broader temperature range in transient time. A unidirectional energy flow is achieved by controlling the system's initial state through its two-mode squeezed ground state. Furthermore, we show that the steady-state stored energy, along with its corresponding ergotropy, can be enhanced at larger temperatures and stronger coupling strengths. Notably, a purely beam-splitter or two-mode squeezing interaction yields zero ergotropy. These findings indicate that the enhanced stored energy and ergotropy of the quantum battery arises principally from the combined effects of beam-splitter and parametric amplification (squeezing) couplings. In addition, the presence of the squared electromagnetic vector potential term can prevent a phase transition and achieve a significant charging energy and high ergotropy in the deep-strong coupling regime. The results presented herein enhance our understanding of the operating principles of open bosonic quantum batteries."}

In this article, we formulate three-photon interference in terms of ``each three-photon interfering only with itself.'' We show that although a generalized two-alternative three-photon interference setup based on CPDC or TOPDC involves eight different length parameters, the interference can be fully characterized in terms of only three independent parameters. The first parameter is the three-photon path-length difference, which has a direct analog in the one-photon and two-photon cases, and the other two parameters quantify the path-asymmetry length. Unlike two-photon interference, which requires only one parameter to quantify path-asymmetry, two independent parameters are needed in three-photon interference. This results in a broader class of nonclassical three-photon effects, including three-photon HOM-type effects.

In particular, the role of the self-generated magnetic field arising from electron motion and the feasibility of coherent spin control without disrupting diffraction coherence have not been quantitatively investigated. In this article, a self-consistent Maxwell-Pauli framework is developed to study spin-resolved electron diffraction from nanogratings in the presence of magnetic fields. The model incorporates geometric confinement, image-charge interactions, self-generated magnetostatic fields, and externally applied magnetic fields. Numerical simulations show that the intrinsic magnetic self-field produced by the electron probability current is several orders of magnitude too weak to induce measurable spin mixing, demonstrating that nanogratings act as spin-conserving beam splitters under field-free conditions. When a uniform magnetic field is applied upstream of the nanograting, coherent Larmor precession enables controlled spin rotation without modifying the diffraction geometry or degrading coherence. The magnetic field required for a $π$ spin rotation scales inversely with the interaction length and electron de Broglie wavelength $λ_{dB}$. Furthermore, a downstream nonuniform magnetic field applied after the nanograting imparts a spatially varying Zeeman phase, producing opposite transverse momentum shifts for the two spin components. The spin-dependent transverse dynamics is analyzed using Husimi Q-function phase-space maps, which visualize spin-dependent population redistribution and momentum separation. The proposed approach enables tunable spatial separation of spin-resolved free electron beams and establishes an all-magnetic route for coherent spin rotation, control, and interferometry."}

We introduce a tensor-based parametrization where the diagonal entries of these states are encoded as a symmetric tensor, enabling a direct translation between entanglement properties and well-studied convex cones of tensors. Our results bridge multipartite entanglement theory with semialgebraic geometry and the theory of completely positive and copositive tensors. This dictionary maps separability to completely positive tensors, the PPT property to moment tensors, entanglement witnesses to copositive tensors, and decomposable witnesses to sum of squares tensors. Using this framework, we construct explicit PPT entangled states in three or more qutrits. In this class of states, we establish that PPT entanglement exists for all multipartite systems with three qutrits or more, disproving a recent conjecture in [J. Math. Phys. 66, 022203 (2025)]. We also show that, for mixtures of Dicke states, the PPT condition with respect to the most balanced bipartition implies PPT with respect to any other bipartition. We further connect bosonic extendibility of mixtures of Dicke states to the duals of known hierarchies for non-negative polynomials, such as the ones by Reznick and Polya.

Yet, the product states typically only span parts of a larger degenerate eigenspace. Here, we classify this eigenspace in the one-dimensional periodic XXZ chain at all roots of unity $q$, where $q^2$ is an $\\ell$-th primitive root of unity. For commensurate chain lengths $N$ with $q^N=1$, we prove that the minimal degeneracy is $2^{N/\\ell}\\ell$ using the representation theory of the affine Temperley-Lieb (aTL) algebra. For the incommensurate case, we derive analogous exponential lower bounds of $2^{2\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2\\ell}\\rfloor+1}$ if $N$ is even and $2^{2\\lfloor \\frac{N}{2\\ell}+\\frac{1}{2}\\rfloor}$ if $N$ is odd and $q^\\ell=1$.

Our work demonstrates for a concrete system how the interplay of the Bethe ansatz, aTL representation theory, and twisted boundary conditions explains degeneracy connected to long-lived product states, stimulating research towards generalization to higher dimensions. Exponential degeneracy could boost applications of spin chains as quantum sensors."}

This one-dimensional system of free fermions has time-dependent stochastic hopping amplitudes that are uniform in space. We focus on two paradigmatic setups: domain-wall melting and the expansion of a trapped gas. Both are investigated by extending the framework of quantum generalized hydrodynamics to account for the underlying stochastic dynamics. We derive the evolution of the local quasiparticle occupation function, which characterizes the system at large space-time scales, and analyze the resulting entanglement spreading. By incorporating quantum fluctuations of the occupation function and employing conformal field theory techniques, we obtain the exact contribution to the entanglement entropy for each individual noise realization. Averaging over these realizations then yields the full entanglement statistics in the hydrodynamic regime. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by exact numerical calculations. The results presented here constitute the first application of quantum generalized hydrodynamics to stochastic quantum systems, demonstrating that this framework can be successfully extended beyond purely unitary dynamics to include stochastic effects."}
