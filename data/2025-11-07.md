TL;DR: 研究评估了LLM在高温铜酸盐领域的表现，发现RAG系统优于封闭模型，但仍有不足。专家问题和评估标准为未来研究提供了工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在专业领域（以高温铜酸盐为例）中提供准确、全面答案的能力。

Method: 构建了一个专家策划的1,726篇科学论文数据库和67个专家提出的问题，评估了六种基于LLM的系统，包括商业封闭模型和自定义的RAG系统。

Result: 使用RAG系统的两种模型在提供全面和有据支持的答案方面表现优于封闭模型。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在科学文献探索中显示出潜力，尤其是在使用RAG系统时表现优于封闭模型，但仍存在关键的局限性。专家制定的问题和评估标准为评估LLM的专业水平提供了宝贵工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise as a powerful tool for
scientific literature exploration. However, their effectiveness in providing
scientifically accurate and comprehensive answers to complex questions within
specialized domains remains an active area of research. Using the field of
high-temperature cuprates as an exemplar, we evaluate the ability of LLM
systems to understand the literature at the level of an expert. We construct an
expert-curated database of 1,726 scientific papers that covers the history of
the field, and a set of 67 expert-formulated questions that probe deep
understanding of the literature. We then evaluate six different LLM-based
systems for answering these questions, including both commercially available
closed models and a custom retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system capable
of retrieving images alongside text. Experts then evaluate the answers of these
systems against a rubric that assesses balanced perspectives, factual
comprehensiveness, succinctness, and evidentiary support. Among the six systems
two using RAG on curated literature outperformed existing closed models across
key metrics, particularly in providing comprehensive and well-supported
answers. We discuss promising aspects of LLM performances as well as critical
short-comings of all the models. The set of expert-formulated questions and the
rubric will be valuable for assessing expert level performance of LLM based
reasoning systems.

### [2] [Dynamics of the Schmid-Higgs Mode in $d$-wave superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03790)
*Samuel Awelewa,Maxim Dzero*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: A study on the oscillatory dynamics of a d-wave superconductor's order parameter after perturbation, finding a frequency twice the anti-nodal pairing amplitude and a 1/t² decay rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the peculiar oscillatory behavior of the order parameter in a d-wave superconductor after a sudden perturbation.

Method: The study employs a quasi-classical approach to superconductivity and numerically solves the equations of motion for Anderson pseudospins.

Result: The frequency of oscillations is determined to be twice the pairing amplitude in the anti-nodal direction, with amplitude decaying as 1/t².

Conclusion: The study concludes that the frequency of oscillations in the longitudinal collective mode is twice the pairing amplitude in the anti-nodal direction, and the amplitude decays as 1/t², supported by numerical simulations.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of the longitudinal collective mode in an
unconventional superconductor. For concreteness, we assume that the
superconductor is described by a $d$-wave order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$
symmetry. After the superconductor has been suddenly subjected to a
perturbation at time $t=0$, the order parameter exhibits a peculiar oscillatory
behavior, with the amplitude of the oscillations slowly decaying with time in a
power-law fashion. Assuming that the initial perturbation is weak, we use a
formalism based on quasi-classical approach to superconductivity to determine
both the frequency of the oscillations as well as how fast these oscillations
decay with time by evaluating the time dependence of the pairing
susceptibility. We find that the frequency of the oscillations is given by
twice the value of the pairing amplitude in the anti-nodal direction and its
amplitude decays as $1/t^2$. The results are also verified by a direct
calculation of the order parameter dynamics by numerically solving the
equations of motion for the Anderson pseudospins.

TL;DR: QP multiplication via vortex trapping degrades qubit coherence; new spectroscopy reveals self-sustained QP growth, highlighting a need for mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the degradation of coherence in transmon qubits caused by QP poisoning, particularly due to unexplored vortex-trapping mechanisms.

Method: Femtosecond-resolved magneto-reflection spectroscopy was used to directly observe QP multiplication and dynamics in a nonequilibrium regime.

Result: QP multiplication was resolved, showing a 34% increase in QP density at high vortex densities, with self-sustained growth of QPs despite phonon population saturation.

Conclusion: The study establishes a spectroscopic tool for detecting quasiparticle (QP) multiplication and identifies vortex-assisted QP relaxation as a critical issue needing mitigation to improve superconducting qubit coherence.

Abstract: Even in the quantum limit, non-equilibrium quasiparticle (QP) populations
induce QP poisoning that irreversibly relaxes the quantum state and
significantly degrades the coherence of transmon qubits. A particularly
detrimental yet previously unexplored mechanism arises from QP multiplication
facilitated by vortex trapping in superconducting quantum circuits, where a
high-energy QP relaxes by breaking additional Cooper pairs and amplifying the
QP population due to the locally reduced excitation gap and enhanced quantum
confinement within the vortex core. Here we directly resolve this elusive QP
multiplication process by revealing vortex-controlled QP self-generation in a
highly nonequilibrium regime preceding the phonon bottleneck of QP relaxation.
At sufficiently low fluence, femtosecond-resolved magneto-reflection
spectroscopy directly reveals a continuously increasing QP population that is
strongly dependent on magnetic-field-tuned vortex density and absent at higher
excitation fluences. Quantitative analysis of the emergent QP pre-bottleneck
dynamics further reveals that, although the phonon population saturates within
$\simeq$10~ps, both free and trapped QPs continue to grow in a self-sustained
manner--hallmarks of the long-anticipated QP-vortex interactions in
nonequilibrium superconductivity. We estimate a substantial increase of
$\sim$34\% in QP density at vortex densities of $\sim$ 100 magnetic flux quanta
per $\mathrm{\mu m^{2}}$. Our findings establish a powerful spectroscopic tool
for uncovering QP multiplication and reveal vortex-assisted QP relaxation as a
critical materials bottleneck whose mitigation will be essential for resolving
QP poisoning and enhancing coherence in superconducting qubits.

### [4] [Superconducting Properties on Two-dimensional Quasicrystal (Ta$_{0.95}$Cu$_{0.05}$)$_{1.6}$Te Studied with $^{125}$Te-NMR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04208)

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: NMR study of quasicrystal (Ta_{0.95}Cu_{0.05})_{1.6}Te reveals unusual superconducting behavior, with a small coherence peak and potential parity mixing, differing from conventional BCS predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the superconducting properties and potential unconventional behavior in the recently discovered quasicrystal superconductor (Ta_{0.95}Cu_{0.05})_{1.6}Te with a transition temperature (T_c) of 0.94 K.

Method: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements were conducted on the quasicrystal (Ta_{0.95}Cu_{0.05})_{1.6}Te to investigate its physical properties in both normal and superconducting states.

Result: The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T_1) exhibits a small coherence peak just below T_c, followed by an exponential decrease, aligning with an s-wave superconducting model but with a gap slightly smaller than the BCS value. The NMR spectra show minimal broadening or shift in the superconducting state.

Conclusion: The study suggests that the quasicrystal (Ta_{0.95}Cu_{0.05})_{1.6}Te exhibits an unusual superconducting state, possibly involving parity mixing, as indicated by the small coherence peak and lack of significant broadening or shift in NMR spectra.

Abstract: Physical properties in the normal and superconducting (SC) state are
investigated with $^{125}$Te-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in a
quasicrystal $\mathrm{(Ta_{0.95}Cu_{0.05})_{1.6}Te}$, which was a recently
discovered superconductor with the SC transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ =
0.94 K. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ shows a coherence peak
just below $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, followed by an exponential decrease down to 0.1 K.
The overall temperature dependence of $1/T_1$ is in good agreement with an
$s$-wave SC model with a SC gap slightly smaller than the BCS value. However,
the coherence peak is unusually small, which may be attributable to a reduced
Bogoliubov peak theoretically predicted for quasicrystals. Furthermore,
$^{125}$Te-NMR spectra show almost no broadening nor shift in the SC state,
suggesting that an unusual SC state such as parity mixing might be realized in
the Ta$_{1.6}$Te superconductor.

### [5] [High-Tc superconductivity above 130 K in cubic MH4 compounds at ambient pressure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04222)
*Xinxin Li,Weishuo Xu,Zengguang Zhou,Jingming Shi,Hanyu Liu,Yue-Wen Fang,Wenwen Cui,Yinwei Li,Miguel A. L. Marques*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Study proposes MH4 compounds as ambient-pressure superconductors with high-Tc, identified PtH4, AuH4, PdH4 as promising candidates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of high pressures in achieving room-temperature superconductivity by proposing a new class of hydrogen-based compounds.

Method: Comprehensive first-principles calculations were used to analyze the superconducting properties of MH4 compounds with bcc PtHg4 structure.

Result: Identified three superconductors with high critical temperatures (84 K, 89 K, 133 K) due to strong electron-phonon coupling from hydrogen vibrations.

Conclusion: The study identifies three promising ambient-pressure superconductors (PtH4, AuH4, PdH4) with critical temperatures above the liquid-nitrogen threshold, providing insights for future high-Tc superconductor design.

Abstract: Hydrides have long been considered promising candidates for achieving
room-temperature superconductivity; however, the extremely high pressures
typically required for high critical temperatures remain a major challenge in
experiment. Here, we propose a class of high-Tc ambient-pressure
superconductors with MH4 stoichiometry. These hydrogen-based compounds adopt
the bcc PtHg4 structure type, in which hydrogen atoms occupy the one-quarter
body-diagonal sites of metal lattices, with the metal atoms acting as chemical
templates for hydrogen assembly. Through comprehensive first-principles
calculations, we identify three promising superconductors, PtH4, AuH4 and PdH4,
with superconducting critical temperatures of 84 K, 89 K, and 133 K,
respectively, all surpassing the liquid-nitrogen temperature threshold of 77 K.
The remarkable superconducting properties originate from strong electron-phonon
coupling associated with hydrogen vibrations, which in turn arise from phonon
softening in the mid-frequency range. Our results provide crucial insights into
the design of high-Tc superconductors suitable for future experiments and
applications at ambient pressure.

TL;DR: A framework analyzes upper critical in-plane magnetic fields in multilayer superconductors, revealing a spin-orbit parameter discrepancy in graphene-WSe2 experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore unconventional superconductors and investigate superconductivity with high in-plane magnetic field resilience and magnetic field-induced superconductivity, leveraging recent studies on Bernal bilayer and rhombohedral multilayer graphene.

Method: The framework uses an analytically tractable superconducting pairing model to study the Hc2-Tc critical curve, considering experimental parameters (Ising and Rashba spin-orbit coupling) and depairing mechanisms (Zeeman and orbital coupling) for spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing.

Result: The framework successfully analyzes the Hc2-Tc relationship and highlights a discrepancy in spin-orbit parameters in Bernal bilayer graphene-WSe2 experiments.

Conclusion: The study proposes a framework for analyzing the upper critical in-plane magnetic field data in multilayer superconductors, identifying a discrepancy between fitted and measured spin-orbit parameters in Bernal bilayer graphene-WSe2 experiments, which may be explained by an enhanced Landé g factor.

Abstract: The study of the interplay of applied external magnetic field and
superconductivity has been invigorated by recent works on Bernal bilayer and
rhombohedral multilayer graphene. These studies, with and without proximitized
spin-orbit coupling, have opened up a new frontier in the exploration of
unconventional superconductors as they offer a unique platform to investigate
superconductivity with high degree of in-plane magnetic field resilience and
even magnetic field-induced superconductivity. Here, we present a framework for
analyzing the upper critical in-plane magnetic field data in multilayer
superconductors. Our framework relies on an analytically tractable
superconducting pairing model that captures the normal state phenomenology of
these systems and applies it to calculate the relationship between the upper
critical field $H_{c2}$ and the corresponding critical temperature $T_{c}$. We
study the $H_{c2}-T_{c}$ critical curve as a function of experimental
parameters (Ising and Rashba spin-orbit coupling) and depairing mechanisms
(Zeeman and orbital coupling) for both spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing.
By applying our framework to analyze four recent Bernal bilayer
graphene-WSe$_2$ experiments [1-4], we identify an apparent discrepancy between
fitted and measured spin-orbit parameters, which we propose can be explained by
an enhancement of the Land\'e g factor in the Bernal bilayer graphene
experiments.

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Nanoscale-engineered weak links at the LAO/KTO interface demonstrate the supercurrent diode effect with reversible polarity and 13% rectification efficiency, offering a platform for quantum circuit design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To realize the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) as a building block for dissipationless electronics and quantum circuits by breaking time-reversal and inversion symmetry in the device.

Method: Conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) lithography was used to pattern reconfigurable superconducting weak links at the LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) interface, with deliberate engineering of the weak link geometry at the nanoscale.

Result: SDE was achieved in the presence of modest out-of-plane magnetic fields, with polarity reversal by changing the weak link position and rectification efficiency up to 13%. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations confirmed the origin of SDE as asymmetric vortex motion.

Conclusion: The demonstration of SDE in the LAO/KTO system provides a versatile platform for investigating vortex dynamics and serves as a basis for engineered quantum circuit elements.

Abstract: The supercurrent diode effect (SDE), characterized by nonreciprocal critical
currents, represents a promising building block for future dissipationless
electronics and quantum circuits. Realizing SDE requires breaking both
time-reversal and inversion symmetry in the device. Here we use conductive
atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) lithography to pattern reconfigurable
superconducting weak links (WLs) at the LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) interface. By
deliberately engineering the WL geometry at the nanoscale, we realize SDE in
these devices in the presence of modest out-of-plane magnetic fields. The SDE
polarity can be reversed by simply changing the WL position, and the
rectification efficiency reaches up to 13% under optimal magnetic field
conditions. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations reveal that the observed
SDE originates from asymmetric vortex motion in the inversion-symmetry-breaking
device geometry. This demonstration of SDE in the LAO/KTO system establishes a
versatile platform for investigating and engineering vortex dynamics, forming
the basis for engineered quantum circuit elements.

### [8] [Pair-mixing induced Time-reversal-breaking superconductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04629)
*Saswata Mandal,Chao-Xing Liu*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: A new pair-mixing state explains spontaneous TR symmetry breaking in TMD superconductors through combined s- and p-wave channels, validated by experimental diode effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the discrepancy between time-reversal symmetry breaking in some TMD superconductors and the absence of it in their pristine counterparts, despite similar transition temperatures.

Method: A new pair-mixing state combining s-wave and p-wave pairing channels via finite Cooper-pair momentum was proposed, analyzed using Ginzburg-Landau theory.

Result: Fourth-order terms in the chiral p-wave channel can generate TR-breaking superconducting states, explaining the observed zero-field, junction-free superconducting diode effect.

Conclusion: The proposed pair-mixing state provides a plausible explanation for spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in TMD superconductors, aligning with experimental observations and offering a theoretical framework for future studies.

Abstract: Experimental evidences of spontaneous time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking
have been reported for the superconducting ground state in the transition metal
dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductor 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ or chiral molecule
intercalated TaS$_2$ hybrid superlattices, and is regarded as evidence of
emergent chiral superconductivity. However, the $T_c$ of these TMD
superconductors is of the same order as pristine 1H or 2H-TaS$_2$, which do not
show any signature of TR breaking and are believed to be conventional
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. To resolve this puzzle, we propose a
new type of pair-mixing state that mixes the dominant conventional s-wave
pairing channel with the subdominant chiral p-wave pairing channel via a finite
Cooper-pair momentum, based on symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg-Landau
theory. Our analysis shows that the fourth-order terms in the chiral p-wave
channel can lead to a variety of pair-mixing states with spontaneous TR
breaking. These TR-breaking superconducting states also reveal a zero-field,
junction-free superconducting diode effect that is observed in chiral molecule
intercalated TaS$_2$ superlattices.

### [9] [Phase Separation in Kitaev Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20312)
*Kazuhiro Kuboki*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Extending the Kitaev chain model to include non-superconducting order parameters results in phase separation in the superconducting state for strong interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effects of including order parameters other than the superconducting order parameter in the Kitaev chain, as the traditional analysis focuses solely on the superconducting order parameter.

Method: The analysis considers a one-dimensional spinless fermion model (Kitaev chain) and extends the traditional approach by including additional order parameters.

Result: The superconducting state becomes prone to phase separation when additional order parameters are included, particularly under moderate to strong attractive interactions.

Conclusion: The study shows that the inclusion of order parameters beyond the superconducting order parameter in the Kitaev chain model leads to phase separation in the superconducting state under moderate to strong attractive interactions.

Abstract: Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional spinless fermion model that has $p$-wave
superconducting (SC) states and Majorana zero modes at the edge. Usually this
model is analyzed by taking only SC order parameter (OP) into account, but the
situation significantly changes when OPs other than the SCOP are included. It
turns out that the SC state in the latter case is prone to phase separation for
moderate to strong attractiive interactions.

### [10] [Dynamics of Josephson junctions beyond the tunneling limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03811)
*Jacob F. Steiner,Larissa Melischek,Felix von Oppen*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper extends the RCSJ model to include nonlinear dissipative currents and arbitrary current-phase relations, addressing limitations like the Josephson diode effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is motivated by the need to address the limitations of the traditional RCSJ model, particularly its inability to describe the Josephson diode effect and other phenomena involving nonlinear dissipative currents and arbitrary current-phase relations.

Method: The authors derive a generalized RCSJ model by extending the traditional tunneling limit approach, incorporating nonlinear current-voltage characteristics and arbitrary current-phase relations. They also deduce a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem to describe the Langevin current.

Result: A generalized RCSJ model is derived, capable of describing dissipative currents with nonlinear characteristics and supercurrents with arbitrary current-phase relations. A generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem is also formulated to support the model.

Conclusion: The paper presents a generalized version of the RCSJ model that accommodates nonlinear dissipative currents and arbitrary current-phase relations for supercurrents, along with a derived generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This advancement addresses limitations in describing phenomena like the Josephson diode effect within the traditional RCSJ model.

Abstract: The dynamics of the superconducting phase difference across a Josephson
junction can be described within the resistively and capacitively shunted
Josephson junction (RCSJ) model. Microscopic derivations of this model
traditionally rely on the tunneling limit. Here, we present a derivation of a
generalized version of the RCSJ model, which accounts for dissipative currents
with nonlinear current-voltage characteristics as well as supercurrents with
arbitrary current-phase relations. This requires a generalized
fluctuation-dissipation theorem to describe the Langevin current, which we
deduce along the lines of fluctuation theorems for mesoscopic conductors. Our
work is motivated in particular by recent theories of the Josephson diode
effect, which is not captured within the RCSJ model in the tunneling limit.

### [11] [Unconventional quantization of 2D plasmons in cavities formed by gate slots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03829)
*Ilia Moiseenko,Olga Polischuk,Viacheslav Muravev,Dmitry Svintsov*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper reveals unconventional plasmonic cavity modes in 2D electron systems under parallel metal gates, with unique quantization rules and high absorption efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to understand the unusual plasmonic properties and quantization rules in the cavity formed by parallel metal gates, which differ from conventional optical cavities.

Method: The study employs theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration to explore the quantization conditions and resonant plasmon modes in the cavity.

Result: The results show that the lowest resonance occurs at one eighth of the plasmon wavelength, with a non-trivial phase shift and weak decay into the gated 2D electron system. Absorption cross-sections reach ∼50% of the fundamental dipole limit.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the plasmonic cavity formed by parallel metal gates above a 2D electron system exhibits unconventional mode quantization, with a unique phase shift and weak decay characteristics.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the slot between parallel metal gates placed above
two-dimensional electron system (2DES) forms a plasmonic cavity with
unconventional mode quantization. The resonant plasmon modes are excited when
the slot width $L$ and the plasmon wavelength $\lambda$ satisfy the condition
$L = \lambda/8 +n \times \lambda/2$, where $n=0, 1, 2 \ldots$. The lowest
resonance occurs at a surprisingly small cavity size, specifically one eighth
of the plasmon wavelength, which contrasts with the conventional
half-wavelength Fabry-Perot cavities in optics. This unique quantization rule
arises from a non-trivial phase shift of $-\pi/4$ acquired by the 2D plasmon
upon reflection from the edge of the gate. The slot plasmon modes exhibit weak
decay into the gated 2DES region, with the decay rate being proportional to the
square root of the separation between the gate and the 2DES. Absorption
cross-section by such slots reaches $\sim 50$ % of the fundamental dipole limit
without any matching strategies, and is facilitated by field enhancement at the
metal edges.

TL;DR: Study shows device-algorithm co-design is key for efficient, low-power memristor-based neural networks, reducing energy use by 50% with minimal accuracy impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the trade-offs between learning performance and energy consumption in memristor-based neural networks trained with the hardware-friendly Manhattan update rule.

Method: Systematic study using realistic models of P/D curves, evaluating NLI, conductance range, and number of accessible levels on a single perceptron and a DNN trained on the MNIST dataset.

Result: SPs tolerate P/D nonlinearity up to NLI ≤ 0.01, while DNNs require NLI ≤ 0.001. Increasing discrete conductance states improves convergence. Fixing one memristor of each differential pair reduces training energy by nearly 50% with little accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Device-algorithm co-design is crucial for enabling scalable, low-power neuromorphic hardware for edge AI applications, as demonstrated by the proposed strategy that reduces training energy by nearly 50% with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of memristor based neural networks trained with
the hardware-friendly Manhattan update rule, focusing on the trade offs between
learning performance and energy consumption. Using realistic models of
potentiation/depression (P/D) curves, we evaluate the impact of nonlinearity
(NLI), conductance range, and number of accessible levels on both a single
perceptron (SP) and a deep neural network (DNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.
Our results show that SPs tolerate P/D nonlinearity up to NLI $\leq 0.01$,
while DNNs require stricter conditions of NLI $\leq$ 0.001 to preserve
accuracy. Increasing the number of discrete conductance states improves
convergence, effectively acting as a finer learning rate. We further propose a
strategy where one memristor of each differential pair is fixed, reducing
redundant memristor conductance updates. This approach lowers training energy
by nearly 50% in DNN with little to no loss in accuracy. Our findings highlight
the importance of device algorithm codesign in enabling scalable, low power
neuromorphic hardware for edge AI applications.

TL;DR: Pioneering direct measurement of non-Abelian QGT using orbital-resolved polarimetry, enabling exploration of multi-gap systems' topology and non-Abelian physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent discoveries in semi-metallic multi-gap systems with band singularities and non-Abelian braiding properties necessitate novel experimental approaches to probe these topological phases.

Method: Implementation of an orbital-resolved polarimetry technique to probe the full Bloch Hamiltonian of a six-band two-dimensional synthetic lattice.

Result: Direct experimental access to non-Abelian quaternion charges, the Euler curvature, and the non-Abelian quantum metric associated with all bands.

Conclusion: The work successfully pioneers the direct measurement of the non-Abelian quantum geometric tensor (QGT), unlocking experimental probing of multi-gap systems at the intersection of topology, geometry, and non-Abelian physics.

Abstract: Recent discoveries in semi-metallic multi-gap systems featuring band
singularities have galvanized enormous interest in particular due to the
emergence of non-Abelian braiding properties of band nodes. This previously
uncharted set of topological phases necessitates novel approaches to probe them
in laboratories, a pursuit that intricately relates to evaluating non-Abelian
generalizations of the Abelian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) that
characterizes geometric responses. Here, we pioneer the direct measurement of
the non-Abelian QGT. We achieve this by implementing a novel orbital-resolved
polarimetry technique to probe the full Bloch Hamiltonian of a six-band
two-dimensional (2D) synthetic lattice, which grants direct experimental access
to non-Abelian quaternion charges, the Euler curvature, and the non-Abelian
quantum metric associated with all bands. Quantum geometry has been highlighted
to play a key role on macroscopic phenomena ranging from superconductivity in
flat-bands, to optical responses, transport, metrology, and quantum Hall
physics. Therefore, our work unlocks the experimental probing of a wide
phenomenology of multi-gap systems, at the confluence of topology, geometry and
non-Abelian physics.

### [14] [Description of the orbital Hall effect from orbital magnetic moments of Bloch states: the role of a new correction term in bilayer systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03901)
*Tarik P. Cysne,Ivo Souza,Tatiana G. Rappoport*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper rigorously derives OMM matrix elements, revealing new contributions that affect orbital Hall conductivity in bilayer materials, advancing orbitronics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the omission of the Berry connection term in previous works and explore its impact on the orbital Hall effect in bilayer systems.

Method: Rigorous derivation of the matrix elements of the orbital magnetic moment (OMM) of Bloch states, including the previously omitted Berry connection term.

Result: Two new contributions to the OMM matrix elements were identified, restoring gauge covariance and providing quantitative corrections. These terms reduce the orbital Hall conductivity plateau in bilayer systems.

Conclusion: The derived OMM corrections may enhance the understanding of electronic OMM transport and support the foundations of orbitronics.

Abstract: We present a rigorous derivation of the matrix elements of the orbital
magnetic moment (OMM) of Bloch states. Our calculations include the Berry
connection term in the k-derivatives of Bloch states, which was omitted in
previous works. The resulting formula for the OMM matrix elements applies to
any non-degenerate Bloch states within Hilbert space. We identify two new
contributions: the first restores gauge covariance for non-degenerate states,
while the second, being itself gauge covariant, can provide significant
quantitative corrections depending on the system under study. We examine their
impact on the orbital Hall effect in two bilayer systems: a 2H transition metal
dichalcogenide bilayer and a biased bilayer graphene. In both cases, these new
terms reduce the orbital Hall conductivity plateau compared with results that
neglect them, suggesting that multi-layered van der Waals materials may be
particularly susceptible to the derived OMM corrections. Our findings may
contribute to the formal understanding of electronic OMM transport and to the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the thermal and electrical properties of a novel metasurface structure for potential use in advanced electronic and photonic devices.

Method: Analysis of the thermal and electrical characteristics of a metasurface composed of graphene microribbons (GMRs) connected by nanobridges (NBs), which can be made of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or black-arsenic-phosphorus (b-AsP) nanostructures. The study focuses on the effects of bias voltage and self-heating on thermionic currents.

Result: The study demonstrates that the metasurface exhibits threshold behavior and S-shaped current-voltage characteristics due to self-heating and thermionic feedback, which can be harnessed for various applications.

Conclusion: The devices based on the GMR/GNR, GMR/CNT, and GMR/AsP metasurface structures have potential applications as fast voltage-controlled current switches, sensors, and thermal terahertz/infrared sources due to their unique thermal and electrical characteristics.

Abstract: We analyze the thermal and electrical characteristics of the metasurface
consisting of
  the coplanar interdigital array of the graphene microribbons (GMRs) connected
by nanobridges (NBs). These nanobridges could be implemented using graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs), single-wall semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or
black-arsenic-phosphorus (b-AsP) nanostructures. The bias voltage applied
between neighboring GMRs indices electron and hole two-dimensional systems in
the GMRs and induces thermionic currents flowing through connecting NBs. The
resulting self-heating increases thermionic currents providing an effective
positive feadback between the carrier effective temperature and the injected
currents. This mechanism may lead to thermal breakdown enabling threshold
behavior of current-voltage characteristics and resulting in the S-shape of
these characteristics. The devices based on the GMR/GNR, GMR/CNT, and GMR/AsP
metasurface structures can be used as fast voltage-controlled current switches,
sensors, thermal terahertz and infrared sources, and other devices.

TL;DR: Polariton condensate arrays simulate XY models with fast, scalable phase-locked states, favoring different configurations based on pump power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether states genuinely minimize the corresponding XY Hamiltonian and how convergence time scales with system size.

Method: An analytical model was developed to analyze the stable phase configurations of an array of N condensates.

Result: The system selectively amplifies specific phase configurations dependent on pump power, with N stable phase configurations identified.

Conclusion: The formation rate of phase-locked states remains on the order of 100 ps, demonstrating the exceptional speed and scalability of polariton-based XY simulators.

Abstract: Arrays of bosonic condensates of exciton-polaritons have emerged as a
promising platform for simulating classical XY models, capable of rapidly
reaching phase-locked states that may be mapped to arrays of two-dimensional
classical spins. However, it remains unclear whether these states genuinely
minimize the corresponding XY Hamiltonian and how the convergence time scales
with the system size. Here, we develop an analytical model revealing that an
array of $N$ condensates possesses $N$ stable phase configurations. The system
selectively amplifies a specific configuration dependent on the pump power: at
low power, the state with the smallest eigenvalue of an effective XY
Hamiltonian is favored, while at high power, the state with the largest
eigenvalue prevails. At intermediate pump powers, the system visits all
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Crucially, the formation rate for any of these
phase-locked states remains on the order of 100 ps, independent of the size of
the array, demonstrating the exceptional speed and scalability of
polariton-based XY simulators.

TL;DR: Ambient alkane contamination on graphite alters STM results by suppressing phonon-induced gaps and changing current-distance behavior, with practical implications for detecting contamination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of hydrocarbon contamination (specifically self-assembled normal-alkane layers) on surface properties and STM measurements, addressing inconsistencies in prior studies.

Method: The research compared clean and ambient alkane-contaminated graphite surfaces using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy measurements.

Result: The contamination layer suppresses phonon-induced gaps near the Fermi energy and flattens the exponential decay of current-distance characteristics by a factor of 1.5 to 5, introducing extra conductance channels.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that ambient alkane contamination significantly affects STM measurements by suppressing phonon-induced gaps near the Fermi energy and altering current-distance characteristics. It also provides a practical guide for detecting contamination in STM experiments.

Abstract: Hydrocarbon contamination is an ever-present factor to consider in surface
science measurements. In the case of van der Waals material surfaces, the
structure of this contamination has become known in recent years as a
self-assembled layer of normal-alkanes, resulting from a few days' exposure to
ambient air. Knowledge of its composition and structure enables systematic
investigation of its influence on surface properties. Here, we investigate the
effect of this contamination on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and
spectroscopy measurements by comparing clean and ambient alkane-contaminated
surfaces of graphite. Our results reveal that the ambient alkane layer
suppresses the well-known phonon-induced gap near the Fermi energy, resolving a
long-standing inconsistency in STM studies, where this feature is often absent.
Furthermore, we show that the presence of the contamination layer alters the
current-distance ($I(z)$) characteristics, flattening its exponential decay by
a factor of 1.5 to 5 compared to the clean surface. This change arises from
extra conductance channels through the alkane layer alongside the tunnel
junction, as the tip penetrates the contaminant overlayer. Finally, based on
the $I(z)$ characteristics, we provide a practical guide to detect the presence
of surface contamination in STM measurements.

Result: Multi-particle excitonic complexes produce photoluminescence signals up to two orders of magnitude stronger than in the neutral state, with quantum yields exceeding 50% at high electron concentrations (above 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$).

Conclusion: TMD monolayers serve as a promising platform for studying excitonic complexes in high-density electron gases and offer new opportunities for efficient, atomically thin light emitters.

Abstract: Monolayers of group-VI transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are
two-dimensional semiconductors that exhibit exceptionally strong light-matter
coupling yet typically suffer from low emission quantum yields. In this letter,
we investigate the heavily n-doped regime of a WSe$_2$ monolayer and show that
multi-particle excitonic complexes produce photoluminescence signals up to two
orders of magnitude stronger than in the neutral state. Time-resolved
photoluminescence and differential reflectivity measurements reveal that the
quantum yield rises with carrier density and exceeds 50% for electron
concentrations above 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. These findings establish TMD
monolayers as a platform for exploring excitonic complexes in high-density
electron gases and point toward new opportunities for efficient, atomically

Motivation: Quantum dot-based devices offer precise electrical control and scalability, but many-body phenomena have been limited by fabrication challenges and simultaneous interaction control. This paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The experiment uses a 2x4 array of gate-defined germanium quantum dots, employing Ramsey interferometry and adiabatic mapping of many-body eigenstates to single-spin eigenstates for complete energy spectrum reconstruction.

Result: The spectroscopy protocol successfully reconstructs the energy spectrum, revealing signatures of the crossover from localization to a chaotic phase as interaction strength surpasses magnetic disorder.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the successful observation of a crossover from localization to a chaotic phase in an 8-spin quantum dot array, marking a significant step towards studying many-body phenomena in semiconductor quantum dot systems.

Abstract: Quantum simulators enable studies of many-body phenomena which are
intractable with classical hardware. Spins in devices based on semiconductor
quantum dots promise precise electrical control and scalability advantages, but
accessing many-body phenomena has so far been restricted by challenges in
nanofabrication and simultaneous control of multiple interactions. Here, we
perform spectroscopy of up to eight interacting spins using a 2x4 array of
gate-defined germanium quantum dots. The spectroscopy protocol is based on
Ramsey interferometry and adiabatic mapping of many-body eigenstates to
single-spin eigenstates, enabling a complete energy spectrum reconstruction. As
the interaction strength exceeds magnetic disorder, we observe signatures of
the crossover from localization to a chaotic phase marking a step towards the
observation of many-body phenomena in quantum dot systems.

Conclusion: 量子点热机的性能依赖于少数关键参数，即整体电导率和三种内部动力学不对称性。这些参数为量子态的工程设计提供了指导，可以实现超越简单自旋简并传输水平的优化性能。

Abstract: Continuous particle exchange thermal machines require no time-dependent
driving, can be realised in solid-state electronic devices, and miniaturised to
nanometre scale. Quantum dots, providing a narrow energy filter and allowing to
manipulate particle flow between the hot and cold reservoirs are at the heart
of such devices. It has been theoretically shown that by mitigating passive
heat flow, Carnot efficiency can be approached arbitrarily closely in a quantum
dot heat engine, and experimentally, values of 0.7{\eta}C have been reached.
However, for practical applications, other parameters of a thermal machine,
such as maximum power, efficiency at maximum power, and noise - stability of
the power output or heat extraction - take precedence over maximising
efficiency. We explore the effect of internal microscopic dynamics of a quantum
dot on these quantities and demonstrate that its performance as a thermal
machine depends on few parameters - the overall conductance and three inherent
asymmetries of the dynamics. These parameters will act as a guide to
engineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its
performance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate
transmission level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamic behavior of chiral splitting in altermagnets at finite temperatures, beyond the low-temperature regime.

Method: Investigation of magnon-magnon interactions and the role of long-range anisotropic spin exchange at finite temperatures.

Result: ASE induces chiral splitting at finite temperatures, competing with ISE, leading to temperature-dependent modulation and potential reversal of spin current driven by band splitting.

Conclusion: The study uncovers the intrinsic competition between ISE and ASE in altermagnets, providing new insights into their finite-temperature dynamical behavior.

Abstract: In altermagnets, magnons-the quanta of collective spin excitations-exhibit
chiral splitting even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and external
magnetic fields. Typically, this chiral splitting behavior can be well
described by alternating isotropic spin exchanges (ISE) in the low-temperature
regime; however, its dynamic behavior at a finite temperature remains unclear.
In this study, we reveal that, when including magnon-magnon interactions, long
range anisotropic spin exchange (ASE) can also induce chiral splitting of
magnons at a finite temperature. Crucially, the chiral splitting induced by ASE
competes with that arising from ISE, leading to a pronounced temperature
dependent modulation of the altermagnetic chiral splitting. Moreover, this
competition is intimately connected to spin fluctuations, and can reverse the
spin current driven by the band splitting as temperature increases. Our work
uncovers the intrinsic competition governing collective spin excitations in
altermagnets, providing new insights into their finite-temperature dynamical
behavior.

Motivation: To understand the mechanism behind the magnetic ordering vector transition in metallic triangular antiferromagnets Co$_{1/3\pm\epsilon}$TaS$_2$.

Method: Combined ARPES studies and DFT+DMFT calculations were used to analyze the magnetic ordering vector transition and Fermi surface changes in Co$_{1/3\pm\epsilon}$TaS$_2$.

Result: ARPES-measured Fermi surface maps and DFT+DMFT calculations revealed changes in Fermi surface geometry and magnetic ordering vector from (1/2,0,0) to (1/3,0,0).

Conclusion: The study confirms that the magnetic ordering vector transition in Co$_{1/3\pm\epsilon}$TaS$_2$ is induced by electronic structure changes, supported by ARPES and DFT+DMFT calculations.

Abstract: We report ARPES studies combined with DFT+DMFT calculations to confirm that
the magnetic ordering vector transition from \textbf{Q}=(1/2,0,0) to
\textbf{Q}=(1/3,0,0) in the metallic triangular antiferromagnets
Co$_{1/3\pm\epsilon}$TaS$_2$ ($\epsilon\approx$0.007) is induced by the
electronic structure change in the system. The ARPES-measured Fermi surface
(FS) maps of Co$_{0.325}$TaS$_2$ show two hexagonal and one circular hole-like
FSs around $\Gamma$, which matches well with the triple-\textbf{Q} state by
taking into account the contribution of nesting vectors occurring between Co
3$d$ and Ta 5$d$ orbitals. In the case of Co$_{0.340}$TaS$_2$, a new electron
pocket around K appears and the FS geometry changes as a result of the
correlation effect of Co$_4$S$_{18}$ tripods forming in the system. The
magnetic susceptibility calculations based on the DFT+DMFT band structure
indicate that the most stable magnetic ordering vector changes to (1/3,0,0)
from (1/2,0,0), which is very consistent with the magnetic phase transition
around $x$=1/3 in Co$_{x}$TaS$_2$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the phase diagrams of bilayer models with distinct internal symmetries and understand the resulting phases and transitions, particularly the differences between spin-spin and energy-energy coupled models.

Method: The study involves analyzing the $T=0$ phase diagrams of bilayer models of $S=1/2$ square lattices antiferromagnets with SU(2) Heisenberg symmetry, focusing on 2, 4, and 6 spin exchanges. Two families of bilayer models with different internal symmetries are investigated.

Result: The traditional bilayer model shows a rich phase diagram with N\'eel, valence bond solid, and simple dimer phases, along with both first-order and continuous transitions. The second model, where layers exchange only energy, does not support the simple dimer state but reveals novel phase transitions. The N\'eel-VBS transition is first order in both models, with distinct finite-size scaling behaviors.

Conclusion: The phase diagrams of the bilayer models reveal a variety of phases and transitions, with the spin-spin and energy-energy coupled models exhibiting distinct behaviors. The study provides new insights into the transitions between N\'eel and VBS phases.

Abstract: We study the $T=0$ phase diagrams of models of bilayers of $S=1/2$ square
lattices antiferromagnets with SU(2) Heisenberg symmetry that have 2, 4, and 6
spin exchanges. We study two families of bilayer models with distinct internal
symmetries and, hence, different phase diagram topologies. A traditional
bilayer model in which the interlayer interaction is Heisenberg so that the two
layers can exchange spin (and energy) with each other, making it possible to
achieve a simple dimerized valence bond liquid-like state. The resulting phase
diagram is rich with N\'eel, valence bond solid and simple dimer phases, and
both first-order and continuous transitions, which we demonstrate are
consistent with the conventional Landau theory of order parameters. In the
second family of models in which the layers can exchange only energy but no
spin (reminiscent of the Ashkin-Teller coupling), the simple dimer state cannot
occur. The phase diagrams reveal a number of phase transitions that are
accessed for the first time. We find that the phase transition between N\'eel
and VBS is first order in both the spin-spin and energy-energy coupled models,
although they have strikingly distinct finite-size scaling behavior and that
the transition from VBS to dimer in the spin-spin coupling model deviates from
the expected scenario of an XY model with dangerously irrelevant four-fold
anisotropy.

Motivation: To understand the effects of electronic correlations on altermagnetic band structures, particularly focusing on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic generalization.

Method: The authors investigated the interplay between altermagnetic band structures and electronic correlations using the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model and evaluated the spin susceptibility via the Kubo formula.

Result: A many-body Lifshitz transition occurs with increasing interaction, leading to fully spin-polarized momentum states. The dynamical susceptibility develops a gap proportional to interaction strength and exhibits a sharp peak at a frequency that increases with interaction.

Conclusion: The study reveals that altermagnetism reduces the static transverse susceptibility, while the signal intensity of dynamical susceptibility increases with interaction until the Lifshitz transition and then saturates.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between altermagnetic band structures and
electronic correlations by focusing on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic
generalization of the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. We find that with increasing
interaction, a many-body Lifshitz transition takes place when doubly occupied
regions disappear from the Fermi surface and each momentum state becomes fully
spin polarized. The spin susceptibility is directly evaluated from the Kubo
formula in terms of many-body occupation probabilities. We find that the
dynamical susceptibility, which possesses only transverse non-zero components
for small wavevectors, develops a gap proportional to the interaction strength,
and displays a sharp peak at a frequency increasing with the interaction. %with
increasing frequency. Above the Lifshitz transition, this peak moves to the
lower gap edge and becomes log-divergent. The signal intensity increases with
the interaction up until the Lifshitz transition and saturates afterwards. The
static susceptibility remains unaffected by the correlations and altermagnetism
reduces the static transverse response.

Motivation: To understand how disorder and Zeeman fields affect the helical edge of a 2D topological insulator, particularly in the context of superconductivity.

Method: Bosonization and renormalization-group analysis are used to study the impact of impurity potentials on charge- and spin-density wave correlations and superconducting pair correlations.

Result: Zeeman field amplifies the superconducting gap in the attractive regime and stabilizes impurity effects in the repulsive regime. Disorder suppresses transverse density-wave correlations while enhancing superconducting pair correlations.

Conclusion: Zeeman field and disorder interact to influence superconducting pair correlations and density-wave correlations, with experimentally observable effects on spin conductance.

Abstract: We investigate analytically and numerically the effects of disorder on the
helical edge of the 2D topological insulator in the presence of the Zeeman
field and superconductivity. Employing bosonization and a renormalization-group
analysis, we study how impurity potentials modify charge- and spin-density wave
correlations as well as superconducting pair correlations. Our results reveal
that the Zeeman field controls the competition: in the attractive regime, it
amplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes
impurity effects by keeping the system longer in the relevant regime for
disorder. We also find that disorder induces logarithmic suppression of
transverse density-wave correlations, while at the same time introducing
positive logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations
and contribute to their stability. These effects directly modify the scaling of
spin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the
interplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels.

Motivation: The study aims to understand the low-temperature electric and thermal transport in RuO$_2$, a metallic oxide of significant recent interest, particularly focusing on quadratic temperature dependence in resistivity and phonon scattering.

Method: The study involved measuring electric resistivity and thermal conductivity (both at zero field and at 12 T) to analyze low-temperature transport properties.

Result: The findings include a quadratic temperature dependence in resistivity below ~20 K, confirmation of the Wiedemann-Franz law at zero temperature, and a discrepancy in prefactors of thermal and electric T-square resistivities at finite temperatures.

Conclusion: This paper establishes RuO$_2$ as a weakly correlated Fermi liquid and provides new insights for theoretical studies on electron-electron scattering in metallic oxides.

Abstract: We present a study of low-temperature electric and thermal transport in
RuO$_2$, a metallic oxide which has attracted much recent attention. Careful
scrutiny of electric resistivity reveals a quadratic temperature dependence
below $\sim$ 20 K undetected in previous studies of electronic transport in
this material. The prefactor of this T$^2$ resistivity, given the electronic
specific heat, corresponds to what is expected by the Kadowaki-Woods scaling.
The variation of its amplitude across 4 different samples is negligible despite
an eightfold variation of residual resistivity. There is also a T$^5$
resistivity due to scattering by phonons. By measuring thermal conductivity,
$\kappa$, at zero field and at 12 T, we separated its electronic and the
phononic components and found that the electronic component respects the
Wiedemann-Franz law at zero temperature and deviates downward at finite
temperature. The latter corresponds to a threefold discrepancy between the
prefactors of the two (thermal and electric) T-square resistivities. Our
results, establishing RuO$_2$ as a weakly correlated Fermi liquid, provide new
input for the ongoing theoretical attempt to give a quantitative account of
electron-electron scattering in metallic oxides starting from first principles.

*Siyu He,Hao Song*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper simplifies the study of $З_N$ qudit stabilizer codes by linking their properties to $З_p$ codes, resolves anyon mobility, and introduces computational methods for topological order analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the understanding of topological properties in qudit stabilizer codes, particularly $З_N$ BB codes, and resolve the anyon mobility puzzle in these models.

Method: Polynomial representation and algebraic-geometric methods, including the Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko theorem, are used to study the $З_N$ bivariate-bicycle (BB) codes. Computational methods involving Gröbner bases over the ring of integers are employed.

Result: The topological properties of $З_N$ codes can be determined by their $З_p$ counterparts, enabling the generalization of algebraic-geometric methods. The study also reveals quasi-fractonic behavior and resolves the anyon mobility puzzle.

Conclusion: The study provides a simplified framework for analyzing the topological properties of qudit stabilizer codes by leveraging the properties of their $З_p$ counterparts. It also introduces computational algebraic methods for efficient calculations.

Abstract: We study a broad class of qudit stabilizer codes, termed $\mathbb{Z}_N$
bivariate-bicycle (BB) codes, arising either as two-dimensional realizations of
modulated gauge theories or as $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalizations of binary BB
codes. Our central finding, derived from the polynomial representation, is that
the essential topological properties of these $\mathbb{Z}_N$ codes can be
determined by the properties of their $\mathbb{Z}_p$ counterparts, where $p$
are the prime factors of $N$, even when $N$ contains prime powers ($N = \prod_i
p_i^{k_i}$). This result yields a significant simplification by leveraging the
well-studied framework of codes with prime qudit dimensions. In particular,
this insight directly enables the generalization of the algebraic-geometric
methods (e.g., the Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko theorem) to determine anyon
fusion rules in the general qudit situation. Moreover, we analyze the model's
symmetry-enriched topological order (SET) to reveal a quasi-fractonic behavior,
resolving the anyon mobility puzzle in this class of models. We also present a
computational algebraic method using Gr\"{o}bner bases over the ring of
integers to efficiently calculate the topological order and its SET properties.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Study of Pb9Cu(VO4)6Br2 using DFT+DMFT reveals metallic behaviour and enhanced spin fluctuations under doping, marking it as a promising material in its family.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the correlated electronic structure and local spin behaviour of copper-substituted lead-vanadium bromine apatite.

Method: DFT+DMFT with a two-orbital Cu-centred low-energy model, simulations across temperatures (20, 60, 100 K) and a range of band fillings (2.46 ≤ n ≤ 3.54).

Result: The compound remains metallic even with dynamical correlations near stoichiometric filling (n ≈ 3). Hole and electron doping lead to non-Fermi-liquid behaviour and spectral weight redistribution. Enhanced spin fluctuations are observed at n ≈ 2.94.

Conclusion: The study identifies Pb9Cu(VO4)6Br2 as a promising member of the Cu-substituted apatite family due to its metallic nature and enhanced spin fluctuations under specific doping conditions.

Abstract: We study the correlated electronic structure and local spin behaviour of the
copper-substituted lead-vanadium bromine apatite Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$
using DFT+DMFT with a two-orbital Cu-centred low-energy model. Simulations are
done for several temperatures (20, 60, 100 K) and a broad range of band
fillings 2.46 $\leq$ n $\leq$ 3.54. We find that the present compound stays
metallic even once correlations are treated dynamically around the
stoichiometric filling (n $\simeq$ 3). Away from n $\simeq$ 3, both hole and
electron doping drive the system toward non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, and
spectral weight is transferred from the low-energy peak into upper and lower
Hubbard-like features. By analysing the low-frequency self-energy exponent and
the dynamical part of the local spin susceptibility, we identify a narrow
window of enhanced spin fluctuations on the slightly hole-doped side (n
$\simeq$ 2.94), i.e. a spin-freezing-crossover regime of the kind reported in
the literature for multiorbital Hund metals. This places
Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ among the promising members of the Cu-substituted
apatite family.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Buckled honeycomb N\'eel antiferromagnetic Mott insulators may host high-temperature AF Chern insulators, with room-temperature stability predicted for compounds like Sr$_3$CaOs$_2$O$_9$ through electric field-induced transitions and Kondo lattice modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore high-temperature antiferromagnetic Chern insulators (AFCI) in buckled honeycomb structures, aiming to identify materials with robust quantum states at room temperature, which could have significant implications for quantum computing and spintronics.

Method: The authors utilized a generalized Kondo lattice model to analyze the effects of a perpendicular electric field on the buckled honeycomb structure, focusing on the staggered potential's role in driving the transition to an AFCI phase. The study also addressed the temperature dependence of the Hall conductance and chiral edge states.

Result: Results indicate that the quantization temperature $T_q$ for the Hall conductance depends on spin-orbit coupling and hopping parameters. Above $T_q$, deviations in conductance correlate with spectral broadening of edge states, indicating finite lifetimes. The study predicts room-temperature stability for AFCI in compounds like Sr$_3$CaOs$_2$O$_9$.

Conclusion: The study identifies N\'eel antiferromagnetic Mott insulators with a buckled honeycomb structure as potential candidates for high-temperature AF Chern insulators. The use of a generalized Kondo lattice model demonstrates that an electric field can induce the transition to an AFCI phase, with predictions suggesting stability up to room temperature in specific compounds like Sr$_3$CaOs$_2$O$_9$.

Abstract: We propose N\'eel antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott insulators with a buckled
honeycomb structure as potential candidates to host a high-temperature AF Chern
insulator (AFCI). Using a generalized Kondo lattice model we show that the
staggered potential induced by a perpendicular electric field due to the
buckling can drive the AF Mott insulator to an AFCI phase. We address the
temperature evolution of the Hall conductance and the chiral edge states. The
quantization temperature $T_q$, below which the Hall conductance is quantized,
depends essentially on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the hopping
parameter, independent of the specific details of the model. The deviation of
the Hall conductance from the quantized value $e^2/h$ above $T_q$ is found to
be accompanied by a spectral broadening of the chiral edge states, reflecting a
finite life-time, i.e., a decay. Using parameters typical for heavy
transition-metal elements we predict that the AFCI can survive up to room
temperature. We suggest Sr$_3$CaOs$_2$O$_9$ as a potential compound to realize
a high-$T$ AFCI phase.

TL;DR: D-Wave quantum annealers effectively sample from the Boltzmann distribution of the ANNNI model, showing high accuracy and low temperature capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the surprising and useful capability of analog quantum computers, like D-Wave quantum annealers, to sample from the Boltzmann distribution defined by classical Hamiltonians, particularly in the context of a canonical frustrated magnetic model.

Method: Examines the ability of D-Wave quantum annealers to sample from the Boltzmann distribution of the ANNNI model, quantifying the Boltzmann sampling error rate for standard linear-ramp anneals across different annealing times.

Result: Identifies analog hardware parameters that achieve very high accuracy (TVD down to 0.0003) and low temperature sampling (down to β=32.2) in a frustrated region of the ANNNI model, supporting the practical utility of quantum annealers.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that current analog quantum computers, specifically D-Wave quantum annealers, are viable for thermodynamic sampling applications of highly frustrated magnetic spin systems, achieving high accuracy and low temperature sampling.

Abstract: One of the surprising, and potentially very useful, capabilities of analog
quantum computers, such as D-Wave quantum annealers, is sampling from the
Boltzmann, or Gibbs, distribution defined by a classical Hamiltonian. In this
study, we thoroughly examine the ability of D-Wave quantum annealers to sample
from the Boltzmann distribution defined of a canonical type of competing
magnetic frustration $J_1$-$J_2$ model; the ANNNI (axial next-nearest-neighbor
Ising) model. Boltzmann sampling error rate is quantified for standard
linear-ramp anneals ranging from $5$ nanosecond annealing times up to $2000$
microseconds on two different D-Wave quantum annealing processors.
Interestingly, we find some analog hardware parameters which result in a very
high accuracy (down to a TVD of $0.0003$) and low temperature sampling (down to
$\beta=32.2$) in a frustrated region of the ANNNI model magnetic phase diagram.
This bolsters the viability of current analog quantum computers for
thermodynamic sampling applications of highly frustrated magnetic spin systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: TE in chaotic quantum systems shows non-Markovianity but minimal impact on few-point correlators; coarse-graining transitions TE to area-law scaling, confirming local dynamics are captured by compact IMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile the apparent high complexity of TE with the rapid thermalization of local observables in chaotic quantum systems.

Method: The paper combines exact solutions of a random-unitary bath model with analytical and numerical analysis of the kicked Ising model to study TE scaling and its relation to non-Markovianity.

Result: TE is extensive for low bath growth rate and reflects non-Markovianity, but its effect on few-point correlators is negligible. Coarse-graining reduces TE scaling to area-law, showing local observables are well-described by a compact IM.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that temporal entanglement (TE) in chaotic quantum systems reflects genuine non-Markovianity but is negligible in few-point temporal correlators. A coarse-graining procedure transitions TE from volume- to area-law scaling, indicating that local observables can be captured by an area-law influence matrix (IM).

Abstract: Temporal entanglement (TE) of an influence matrix (IM) has been proposed as a
measure of complexity of simulating dynamics of local observables in a
many-body system. Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently
argued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law)
scaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM
with the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation
between TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic
quantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding
distillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue
that TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine
non-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex
temporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is
negligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of
measurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to
area-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d
circuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary
points, as well as numerically away from them. This finding indicates that
dynamics of local observables are fully captured by an area-law IM. We provide
evidence that the compact IM MPS obtained via standard compression algorithms
accurately describes local evolution.

TL;DR: Noisy GKP states enable non-Clifford gates via linear optics, achieving computational universality in quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging imperfect GKP stabilizer states to apply non-Clifford gates using only linear optical elements.

Method: Gaussian operations on normalizable GKP states combined with homodyne measurements.

Result: Demonstrated key primitives: clean projection onto Pauli eigenstates and probabilistic projection onto non-Pauli eigenstates.

Conclusion: Normaliizable GKP stabilizer states combined with Gaussian operations offer a practical framework for computational universality in quantum computation.

Abstract: Physical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states are inherently noisy as ideal
ones would require infinite energy. While this is typically considered as a
deficiency to be actively corrected, this work demonstrates that imperfect GKP
stabilizer states can be leveraged in order to apply non-Clifford gates using
only linear optical elements. In particular, Gaussian operations on
normalizable GKP states, combined with homodyne measurements, permit two key
primitives: clean projection onto Pauli eigenstates in the normalizable GKP
codespace, thereby implementing Clifford gates with high fidelity; and
probabilistic projection of unmeasured modes onto non-Pauli eigenstates. These
results demonstrate that normalizable GKP stabilizer states combined with
Gaussian operations provide a practical framework for computational
universality within the measurement-based model of quantum computation in a
realistic continuous-variable setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome lattice mismatch and incompatible growth conditions for combining III-V semiconductor quantum dots and rare-earth ions to enable scalable quantum photonic networks.

Method: Low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of Er³⁺-doped TiO₂ thin films directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates, with controlled surface preparation and minimal coincident interface area modeling.

Result: Epitaxial anatase TiO₂ (001) films with sub-300 pm surface roughness were grown, preserving III-V quantum dot functionality and enabling smooth surfaces for low-loss nanophotonic structures.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a materials platform for monolithically integrating rare-earth quantum memories with semiconductor photon sources, advancing the potential for scalable hybrid quantum photonic chips.

Abstract: Quantum photonic networks require two distinct functionalities: bright
single-photon sources and long-lived quantum memories. III-V semiconductor
quantum dots excel as deterministic and coherent photon emitters, while
rare-earth ions such as erbium (Er$^{3+}$) in crystalline oxides offer
exceptional spin and optical coherence at telecom wavelengths. Combining these
systems and their functionalities via direct epitaxy is challenging due to
lattice mismatch and incompatible growth conditions. Here we demonstrate
low-temperature pulsed laser deposition of Er$^{3+}$-doped TiO$_{2}$ thin films
directly on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Controlled surface preparation with an
arsenic cap and an oxygen-deficient buffer layer enables the growth of
epitaxial anatase TiO$_{2}$ (001) at 390$^{o}$C with sub-300 pm surface
roughness, while avoiding interface degradation. In contrast, high-temperature
oxide desorption or growth temperatures drive the transition to rough,
polycrystalline rutile film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.
Minimal coincident interface area (MCIA) modeling explains the
orientation-selective growth on GaAs and GaSb. Raman and cryogenic
photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy verify the crystal phase and optical
activation of Er$^{3+}$ ions. This multi-parameter growth strategy helps
preserve III-V quantum dot functionality and yields smooth surfaces suitable
for low-loss nanophotonic structures. Our results establish a materials
platform for monolithically integrating rare-earth quantum memories with
semiconductor photon sources, paving the way toward scalable hybrid quantum
photonic chips.

Result: A novel topological QECC encoding characteristic classes (e.g., Chern and Pontryagin class) with an explicit construction of the Euler class of $S^2$.

Conclusion: The paper successfully constructs a novel topological QECC that encodes obstruction classes of fiber bundles, such as the Chern and Euler class, and demonstrates an explicit example with the Euler class of $S^2$.

Abstract: Topological quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) encode a variety of
topological invariants in their code space. A classic structure that has not
been encoded directly is that of obstruction classes of a fiber bundle, such as
the Chern or Euler class. Here, we construct and analyze extensions of toric
codes. We then analyze the topological structure of their errors and finally
construct a novel code using these errors to encode the obstruction class to a
fiber bundle. In so doing, we construct an encoding of characteristic classes
such as the Chern and Pontryagin class in topological QECC. An example of the
Euler class of $S^2$ is constructed explicitly.

TL;DR: Integrable Trotterization of the Ising model retains conserved quantities via an inhomogeneous transfer matrix, revealing dual operators for discrete space-time and mapping between Trotter orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that Trotterization of an integrable many-body system can retain its conserved quantities and explore the implications of discretizing space and time.

Method: Used first-order Trotterization of the critical transverse field Ising model and constructed discrete-time conserved quantities via an inhomogeneous transfer matrix from the quantum inverse scattering method.

Result: Discovered a doubling of Kramers-Wannier duality operators due to discrete space-time, which also map between different Trotterization orders. Extended results to Floquet evolution of the Ising chain.

Conclusion: Integrable Trotterization of the critical transverse field Ising model retains conserved quantities and reveals new duality operators. These operators provide maps between different Trotterization orders and extend insights to Floquet evolution.

Abstract: Integrable trotterization provides a method to evolve a continuous time
integrable many-body system in discrete time, such that it retains its
conserved quantities. Here we explicitly show that the first order
trotterization of the critical transverse field Ising model is integrable. The
discrete time conserved quantities are obtained from an inhomogeneous transfer
matrix constructed using the quantum inverse scattering method. The
inhomogeneity parameter determines the discrete time step. We then focus on the
non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry for the trotterized evolution.
We find that the discretization of both space and time leads to a doubling of
these duality operators. They account for discrete translations in both space
and time. As an interesting application, we find that these operators also
provide maps between trotterizations of different orders. This helps us extend
our results beyond the trotterization scheme and investigate the
Kramers-Wannier duality-symmetry for finite time Floquet evolution of the
critical transverse field Ising chain.

TL;DR: Exact series solution for two-level quantum systems under periodic driving, avoiding numerical truncation issues; uses $\star$-resolvent and path-sum theorem for precise transition probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods for solving transition probabilities in a two-level system under periodic driving require truncation, which can lose critical interference information and introduce artifacts, limiting their effectiveness in quantum sensing and control.

Method: The method utilizes the $\star$-resolvent formalism with the path-sum theorem to derive an exact series solution to Schr\"odinger's equation. This solution is expanded in a non-harmonic Fourier series basis with coefficients from generalized Bessel functions.

Result: The exact series solution provides precise transition probabilities without numerical truncation, capturing all interference effects and avoiding artifacts.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an exact analytical formulation for quantum sensors and control applications, overcoming the limitations of numerical truncation in traditional methods.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce an exact expression for the response of a
semi-classical two-level quantum system subject to arbitrary periodic driving.
Determining the transition probabilities of a two-level system driven by an
arbitrary periodic waveform necessitates numerical calculations through methods
such as Floquet theory, requiring the truncation of an infinite matrix.
However, such truncation can lead to a loss of significant interference
information, hindering quantum sensors or introducing artifacts in quantum
control. To alleviate this issue, we use the $\star$-resolvent formalism with
the path-sum theorem to determine the exact series solution to Schr\"odinger's
equation, therefore providing the exact transition probability. The resulting
series solution is generated from a compact kernel expression containing all of
the information of the periodic drive and then expanded in a non-harmonic
Fourier series basis given by the divided difference of complex exponentials
with coefficients corresponding to products of generalized Bessel functions.
The present method provides an analytical formulation for quantum sensors and
control applications.

Motivation: The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) typically occurs only for specifically chosen initial states, limiting its universality; this work aims to generalize and make QME experimentally feasible.

Method: Applying a temporary bond-dissipation quench to selectively suppress or enhance slow relaxation modes, reshaping relaxation pathways.

Result: Demonstrated the mechanism in systems with dephasing and boundary dissipation, and outlined feasible cold-atom implementations.

Conclusion: The study establishes controllable dissipation as a versatile tool for quantum control, accelerated relaxation, and efficient nonequilibrium protocols.

Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a state farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than
one closer to it, is a striking phenomenon in both classical and quantum
systems. In open quantum systems, however, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME)
typically occurs only for specifically chosen initial states, which limits its
universality. Here we present a general and experimentally feasible strategy to
realize both QME and anti-QME. By applying a temporary bond-dissipation quench,
we selectively suppresses or enhances slow relaxation modes, thereby reshaping
relaxation pathways independently of both the system and the initial state. We
demonstrate this mechanism in systems with dephasing and boundary dissipation,
and outline feasible cold-atom implementations. Our results establish
controllable dissipation as a versatile tool for quantum control, accelerated
relaxation, and efficient nonequilibrium protocols.

Conclusion: 多参数量子传感中，通过量子纠错技术恢复单参数GHZ探针的核心优势，实现在所有未知参数值下达到最优量子增强精度，并保持测量分离和固定。

Abstract: For single-parameter sensing, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) probes
achieve optimal quantum-enhanced precision across the unknown parameter range,
solely relying on parameter-independent separable measurement strategies for
all values of the unknown parameter. However, in the multiparameter setting, a
single GHZ probe not only fails to achieve quantum advantage but also the
corresponding optimal measurement becomes complex and dependent on the unknown
parameters. Here, we provide a recipe for multiparameter sensing with GHZ
probes using quantum error correction techniques by treating all but one
unknown parameters as noise, whose effects can be corrected. This strategy
restores the core advantage of single parameter GHZ-based quantum sensing,
namely reaching optimally quantum-enhanced precision for all unknown parameter
values while keeping the measurements separable and fixed. Specifically, given
one shielded ancilla qubit per GHZ probe, our protocol extracts optimal
possible precision for any probe size. While this optimal precision is
shot-noise limited for a single GHZ probe, we recover the Heisenberg scaling
through use of multiple complementary GHZ probes. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the protocol with Bayesian estimation.

Motivation: To explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven criticality through a novel framework that combines coherence-restoring dynamics and decoherence-inducing events.

Method: Introduces measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) with numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional dimerized Heisenberg model.

Result: MDITE gives rise to a new class of mixed-state phase transitions and provides a diagrammatic representation for efficient numerical studies.

Conclusion: MDITE is a powerful paradigm for studying non-unitary dynamics and the role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems, offering a new perspective on mixed-state phase transitions.

Abstract: Mixed-state phase transitions have recently attracted growing attention as a
new frontier in nonequilibrium quantum matter and quantum information. In this
work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as
a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven
criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective
measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and
decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits,
MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed
states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay
gives rise to a new class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical
simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the
two-dimensional dimerized Heisenberg model. Furthermore, we provide a
diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables
efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body
numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum systems with indefinite causal order can exhibit anomalous heat flow, enabling refrigeration and work generation in a quantum Otto cycle, experimentally demonstrated in a photonic setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether the classical thermodynamic principle of heat flow directionality holds in quantum systems with indefinite causal order and to design a quantum Otto cycle that leverages this phenomenon.

Method: The study involves theoretical analysis and experimental simulation using a photonic quantum setup to investigate heat flow under indefinite causal order.

Result: The study demonstrates an anomalous heat flow where heat can flow from a colder entity to a hotter one under indefinite causal order. It also successfully designs a quantum Otto cycle that achieves refrigeration and generates work.

Conclusion: The experimental simulation in a photonic quantum setup provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the anomalous heat flow and the quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order.

Abstract: The principle that heat spontaneously flows from higher temperature to lower
temperature is a cornerstone of classical thermodynamics, often assumed to be
independent of the sequence of interactions. While this holds true for
macroscopic systems at equilibrium, here we show that, when the order of
interactions between two identical thermalization channels is indefinite, an
anomalous heat flow emerges, whereby heat can sometime flow from a colder
entity to a hotter one. Taking advantage of this anomalous heat flow, we design
a quantum Otto cycle with indefinite causal order, which not only achieves
refrigeration but also generates work. The anomalous heat flow and the quantum
Otto cycle are experimentally simulated in a photonic quantum setup, which
provides a proof-of-principle demonstration of the theory.

Motivation: 解决LABS问题的经典和量子优化方法在时间复杂度上存在不足，需要一种更高效的混合算法。

Result: QE-MTS的时间复杂度降至$⁡$\mathcal{O}(1.24^N)$⁡$，优于经典和现有的量子优化算法。

Conclusion: QE-MTS通过结合经典和量子优化方法，显著降低了LABS问题的时间复杂度，并在序列长度超过47时表现出超越经典方法的优势。

Abstract: We introduce quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search (QE-MTS), a non-variational
hybrid algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art scaling for the
low-autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem. By seeding the classical
MTS with high-quality initial states from digitized counterdiabatic quantum
optimization (DCQO), our method suppresses the empirical time-to-solution
scaling to $\mathcal{O}(1.24^N)$ for sequence length $N \in [27,37]$. This
scaling surpasses the best-known classical heuristic $\mathcal{O}(1.34^N)$ and
improves upon the $\mathcal{O}(1.46^N)$ of the quantum approximate optimization
algorithm, achieving superior performance with a $6\times$ reduction in circuit
depth. A two-stage bootstrap analysis confirms the scaling advantage and
projects a crossover point at $N \gtrsim 47$, beyond which QE-MTS outperforms
its classical counterpart. These results provide evidence that quantum
enhancement can directly improve the scaling of classical optimization
algorithms for the paradigmatic LABS problem.

TL;DR: The paper explores contextual advantages in quantum state discrimination, unifying results across different schemes and suggesting potential benefits in quantum information applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum state discrimination has applications in witnessing generalised contextuality, prompting the exploration of contextual advantages in different discrimination schemes.

Method: Derived noncontextuality inequalities for conclusive and inconclusive outcomes across various guessing strategies.

Result: Contextual advantages are demonstrated for minimum-error discrimination (confidence of outcomes), unambiguous state discrimination (average guessing probability), and maximum-confidence discrimination (confidence, guessing probability, and inconclusive outcome rate).

Conclusion: Our results unify the contextual advantages across all state discrimination schemes and figures of merit, suggesting potential advantages in quantum information applications.

Abstract: Quantum state discrimination, alongside its other applications, has recently
found use as a tool for witnessing generalised contextuality. In this article,
we derive noncontextuality inequalities for both conclusive and inconclusive
outcomes across various guessing strategies. For minimum- error discrimination,
the advantage is in terms of the confidences of individual outcomes, while for
unambiguous state discrimination, it is in terms of the average guessing
probability. For maximum- confidence discrimination, we show that contextual
advantages occur not only for the confidence but also their average, the
guessing probability, as well as the inconclusive outcome rate. Our results
unify the contextual advantages across all state discrimination schemes and
figures of merit. We envisage that various quantum information applications
based on state discrimination may offer advantages over non-contextual
theories.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Dephasing-induced asymmetric leakage in photonic cat qubits enables non-Hermitian physics exploration, showcasing controllable phase transitions and entanglement transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and utilize the asymmetric leakage phenomenon caused by dephasing in photonic cat qubits for probing non-Hermitian physics.

Method: The work leverages the asymmetric leakage from the cat-state subspace to describe system dynamics via a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, enabling control over parity-time symmetry phase transitions and coupling two cat qubits to realize entanglement phase transitions.

Result: Demonstrated controlled parity-time symmetry phase transitions in a single cat qubit and realized entanglement phase transitions in coupled cat qubits.

Conclusion: The study constructs a controllable non-Hermitian system simulator using photonic cat qubits, shifting the paradigm of viewing dephasing as purely harmful noise.

Abstract: Pure dephasing is the dominant leak mechanism in photonic cat qubits because
its phase errors disrupt the parity protection, rendering the qubit vulnerable
to energy relaxation. In this manuscript, we reveal that this dephasing
mechanism conceals an interesting physical phenomenon: it induces
\textit{asymmetric leakage} from the cat-state subspace, where even- and
odd-parity cat states decay at different rates. This leak asymmetry enables the
dynamics of the system to be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, thereby
transforming the cat qubit into a platform with controllable gain and loss for
probing non-Hermitian physics. Within this platform, we demonstrate the
possibility to control the parity-time symmetry phase transition in a single
cat qubit by adjusting its amplitude. Moreover, we couple two cat qubits to
realize an entanglement phase transition induced by the exceptional point. Our
work constructs a controllable non-Hermitian system simulator, overturning the
conventional paradigm that treats dephasing as harmful noise.

### [49] [Expectation-Realization Interpretation of Quantum Superposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04154)
*Yanting Wang*

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets quantum superposition as an expectation over eigenstates, avoiding wavefunction collapse and non-locality, and reframes Bell's tests as validating wave-like probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a clearer interpretation of quantum superposition by integrating probability theory with wave mechanics, avoiding controversial concepts like wavefunction collapse or non-locality.

Method: The paper uses a comparative analysis of Schrödinger's cat and its classical counterpart to argue that quantum superposition is an expectation over eigenstates weighted by wave-like probabilities, realized randomly upon measurement.

Result: The result is a novel interpretation of quantum mechanics (expectation-realization) that simplifies understanding superposition and reinterprets Bell's inequalities tests.

Conclusion: By proposing the expectation-realization interpretation, the paper concludes that quantum superposition can be understood without invoking wavefunction collapse, many worlds, or decoherence, and reframes tests of Bell's inequalities as validating wave-like probabilities rather than non-locality.

Abstract: By comparing Schr\"odinger's cat with its classical counterpart, I show that
a quantum superposition should be understood as an expectation over possible
eigenstates weighted by wave-like probabilities. Upon the occurrence of a
certain event, the quantum system is randomly realized into one of the possible
eigenstates due to its intrinsic stochasticity. While the randomness of a
single realization cannot be controlled or predicted, the overall distribution
can be regulated via experimental setup and converges as the number of events
increases. A measurement is indeed an activity employing a certain event to
convert a quantum effect into a macroscopic outcome. Consequently, the puzzling
concepts of wavefunction collapse, many worlds, and decoherence become
unnecessary for understanding quantum superposition. This
expectation-realization interpretation, which integrates probability theory
with wave mechanics, can also be extended to quantum pathways. Moreover, it
reframes tests of Bell's inequalities as validating the wave-like probability
nature of quantum mechanics, with no need to invoke the mysterious notions of
quantum non-locality and "spooky action at a distance".

Motivation: To test whether a late-time power-law behavior emerges in the fluorescence decay of Acridine Orange, as predicted by quantum mechanical and quantum field theoretical models.

Method: Experimental study using two distinct photon detectors to analyze the fluorescence decay of Acridine Orange.

Result: The data were well described by a sum of two exponential functions with lifetimes τ₁ = 1.7331 ± 0.001 ns and τ₂ = 5.948 ± 0.012 ns, consistent with literature values.

Conclusion: No deviation from the exponential decay law was observed, but the study successfully tested the experimental setup and precisely determined the sample lifetimes.

Abstract: In this work, we experimentally study the fluorescence decay of Acridine
Orange at late times, in order to test whether a late-time power-law behaviour
emerges, a feature expected to be very small but consistent with quantum
mechanical and quantum field theoretical predictions. Using two distinct photon
detectors, we find that the data are well described by a sum of two exponential
functions with lifetimes $\tau_1 = 1.7331 \pm 0.001$ ns and $\tau_2 = 5.948 \pm
0.012$ ns, in agreement with values reported in the literature. While no
deviation from the exponential decay law is observed, this study serves as a
reliable test for the experimental setup and enables a precise determination of
the sample lifetimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of energy teleportation schemes by introducing a more robust and bit-symmetric quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge teleportation.

Method: The protocol is instantiated on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, with closed-form results for two qubits and performance confirmation via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and hardware runs.

Result: The charge teleportation scheme shows marked robustness to realistic noise and model imperfections, preserving key correctness in identified regimes.

Conclusion: The paper positions charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms, demonstrating resilience to noise and model imperfections.

Abstract: We introduce a quantum key distribution (QKD) primitive based on charge
teleportation: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an
entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a
local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to
energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a
single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model
imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models,
star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two
qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization,
circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify
resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes
where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results
position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible
with near-term platforms.

TL;DR: A novel superconducting quantum chip design balances entanglement and readout fidelity, paving the way for scalable quantum processors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between preserving entanglement and maintaining readout fidelity in scalable quantum hardware.

Method: A hybrid multi-qubit configuration with nine transmon qubits organized into interior and exterior groups, interconnected via a flux-tunable qubit and distributed resonators.

Result: Simulation results show strong entanglement with avoided-crossing regions and sustained measurement fidelity around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed superconducting quantum chip architecture successfully co-optimizes entanglement strength and readout fidelity, offering a viable path for scalable quantum processors.

Abstract: This study introduces a superconducting quantum chip architecture designed to
simultaneously preserve entanglement and readout fidelity, addressing one of
the key trade-offs in the development of scalable quantum hardware. In
conventional quantum circuits, strong qubit qubit coupling enhances
entanglement but often leads to undesired crosstalk, dephasing, and reduced
measurement fidelity. To mitigate these effects, we propose a hybrid multiqubit
configuration consisting of nine transmon qubits organized into interior and
exterior groups, interconnected via a flux tunable qubit and a network of
distributed resonators. The interior qubits along with tunable qubit form an
entanglement core, while the exterior qubits operate in the dispersive regime
under large detuning to enable readout. The degree of entanglement can be
dynamically tuned by adjusting the coupling between the central tunable qubit
and the interior qubits. The total Hamiltonian includes all significant
coupling contributions, encompassing effective exchange interactions among
interior and exterior qubits, as well as their mediated couplings through
interface resonators. By numerically solving the complete Hamiltonian alongside
the Lindblad master equation, the system dynamics are characterized, allowing
evaluation of both spectroscopic features and separation fidelity. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed design maintains strong entanglement by
creating the avoided-crossing region while sustaining measurement fidelity
around 0.995 under realistic noise conditions. These findings confirm that
entanglement strength and readout fidelity can be co-optimized within a single,
reconfigurable architecture, establishing a viable route toward
high-performance and scalable superconducting quantum processors.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，扭曲圆柱形表面的几何特性不影响束缚态的能量谱，但对散射问题中的传输概率有显著影响，尤其是粒子角动量和圆柱半径的影响。这些发现对于设计基于可控曲率和扭曲材料的量子器件具有重要意义。

Abstract: Twisted cylindrical tubes are important model systems for nanostructures,
heterostructures, and curved quantum devices. In this work, we investigate the
quantum behavior of an electron confined to a twisted cylindrical surface. By
first calculating the strain tensor to obtain the induced surface metric, we
employ da Costa's formalism to derive the geometry-induced quantum potential.
This potential modifies the Schr\"odinger equation even in the absence of
external forces, allowing us to determine the bound states and energy
eigenvalues. This was made in the linear and non-linear torsion regime.
Furthermore, we analyze two distinct scattering problems: (i) scattering within
an infinite cylinder containing a twisted section, and (ii) scattering of a
free particle incident upon a finite twisted cylinder. Our goal is to
understand how geometry and strain influence the properties of analogous
untwisted systems. It turns out that both the linear and non-linear twists
yield to a geometric phase into the wave function, while the da Costa potential
is kept unchanged. Consequently, the system supports bound states whose energie
spectrum is twist independent. For both scattering problems, we find that the
transmission probability is insensitive to torsion, whereas it is significantly
affected by the particle angular momentum and the cylinder's radius, exhibiting
distinct oscillatory behavior. These findings suggest relevant implications for
engineering quantum devices based on materials with controlled curvature and
twist.

Motivation: To address the challenge of accurately determining ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems without relying on controlled operations, extending algorithm applicability to analog simulators.

Method: The protocol estimates ground-state energy through global time evolution under a target Hamiltonian, avoiding controlled operations. It extracts energy differences via Loschmidt echo measurements, combines them with direct energy measurements, and solves equations to infer eigenenergies. Benchmarked on free-fermion systems, 2D Ising, and Fermi-Hubbard models.

Result: The method shows orders-of-magnitude precision gains over direct energy measurements, with accuracy improving rapidly with initial-state fidelity and persisting for hundreds of modes. Applicability to other observables like order parameters is also demonstrated.

Conclusion: This study introduces a practical and high-precision method for estimating ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems using globally controlled quantum simulators, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and applicability.

Abstract: Accurately determining ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems
remains one of the major challenges of quantum simulation. In this work, we
present a protocol for estimating the ground-state energy using only global
time evolution under a target Hamiltonian. This avoids the need for controlled
operations that are typically required in conventional quantum phase estimation
and extends the algorithm applicability to analog simulators. Our method
extracts energy differences from measurements of the Loschmidt echo over an
initial ground-state approximation, combines them with direct energy
measurements, and solves a set of equations to infer the individual
eigenenergies. We benchmark this protocol on free-fermion systems, showing
orders-of-magnitude precision gains over direct energy measurements on the
initial state, with accuracy improving rapidly with initial-state fidelity and
persisting for hundreds of modes. We further demonstrate applicability to the
2D Ising and Fermi-Hubbard models and show that the approach extends naturally
to other observables such as order parameters. Finally, we analyze the effect
of experimental imperfections and propose error-mitigation strategies. These
results establish a practical route to compute physically relevant quantities
with high precision using globally controlled quantum simulators.

Motivation: To address the gap between the theoretical promise of geometric quantum gates' resilience to control errors and their inconsistent practical robustness.

Method: A streamlined framework for nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates (NGQGs) with auxiliary constraints to suppress dynamical contamination and achieve super-robust performance, including the design of NGQGs using noncyclic paths.

Result: High-fidelity single-qubit gates robust against Rabi amplitude error (infidelity scaling as O(ϵ⁴)), and analysis of two-qubit NGQGs revealing performance limitations.

Conclusion: The super-robust NGQG scheme demonstrates high-fidelity single-qubit gates and identifies limitations in two-qubit scenarios, highlighting the importance of phase compensation and waveform calibration.

Abstract: While geometric quantum gates are often theorized to possess intrinsic
resilience to control errors by exploiting the global properties of evolution
paths, this promise has not consistently translated into practical robustness.
We present a streamlined framework for nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates
(NGQGs) that incorporates additional auxiliary constraints to suppress
dynamical contamination and achieve super-robust performance. Within this
framework, we also design NGQGs using noncyclic paths, offering enhanced design
flexibility. Implemented on superconducting transmon qubits, our scheme
realizes high-fidelity single-qubit gates that are robust against Rabi
amplitude error $\epsilon$, with infidelity scaling as
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^4)$, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$
behavior of conventional dynamical gates. We further analyze two-qubit NGQGs
under parametric driving. Our results identify subtle limitations that
compromise performance in two-qubit scenarios, underscoring the importance of
phase compensation and waveform calibration. The demonstrated simplicity and
generality of our super-robust NGQG scheme make it applicable across diverse

Motivation: To provide a framework for continuous matrix product operators in quantum field theory that avoids lattice parameters and preserves entanglement laws.

Method: The ansatz is derived as a continuum limit of matrix product operators and is expressed in terms of finite matrix-valued functions.

Result: The ansatz successfully constructs continuous matrix product unitaries beyond quantum cellular automata and maps continuous matrix product states to another cMPS.

Conclusion: The ansatz introduces a novel method for continuous matrix product operators in quantum field theory, offering a closed-form expression and preserving entanglement area laws.

Abstract: In this work we introduce an ansatz for continuous matrix product operators

construct several families of continuous matrix product unitaries beyond
quantum cellular automata.

TL;DR: Autonomous local coherence in a TLS can persist and be enhanced by interactions within the environment, with temperature-dependent signatures of a quantum phase transition, offering new observational strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the role of interactions within the environment in generating autonomous local coherence, which has remained unexplored despite its potential significance.

Method: Analysis of an exactly solvable model comprising a target TLS coupled to N interacting source TLSs representing the environment, with the system in thermal equilibrium.

Result: Local coherence not only persists but can be enhanced at finite temperatures compared to cases with no inter-source interactions, with temperature dependence showing signatures of a quantum phase transition.

Conclusion: The study highlights the generic properties of autonomously generated quantum coherence and provides viable routes for observing this coherence at nonzero temperatures.

Abstract: Local quantum coherence in a two-level system (TLS) is typically generated
via time-dependent driving. However, it can also emerge autonomously from
symmetry-breaking interactions between the TLS and its surrounding environment
at a low temperature. Although such environments often consist of interacting
atoms or spins, the role of interactions within the environment in generating
the autonomous local coherence has remained unexplored. Here, we address this
gap by analyzing an exactly solvable model, which comprises a target TLS
coupled to $N$ interacting source TLSs that represent the environment, with the
whole system being in thermal equilibrium. We show that the local coherence not
only persists but can be enhanced at finite temperatures of the environment
compared to the case of no inter-source interactions. The temperature
dependence of the coherence bears signatures of a quantum phase transition, and
our analytical results suggest strategies for its optimization. Our findings
reveal generic properties of the autonomously generated quantum coherence and
point to viable routes for observing the coherence at nonzero temperatures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the practical overhead and impact of symmetrization in quantum machine learning.

Method: Developed an automated pipeline to measure quantum machine learning ansatzes with respect to symmetries.

Result: Demonstrated varying gate overhead and confirmed that increased symmetry reduces expressibility while often increasing entanglement capability.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the trade-offs between symmetry and expressibility in quantum machine learning, aiding in the selection of efficient ansatze for geometric quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Leveraging data symmetries has been a key driver of performance gains in
geometric deep learning and geometric and equivariant quantum machine learning.
While symmetrization appears to be a promising method, its practical overhead,
such as additional gates, reduced expressibility, and other factors, is not
well understood in quantum machine learning. In this work, we develop an
automated pipeline to measure various characteristics of quantum machine
learning ansatzes with respect to symmetries that can appear in the learning
task. We define the degree of symmetry in the learning problem as the size of
the subgroup it admits. Subgroups define partial symmetries, which have not
been extensively studied in previous research, which has focused on symmetries
defined by whole groups. Symmetrizing the 19 common ansatzes with respect to
these varying-sized subgroup representations, we compute three classes of
metrics that describe how the common ansatz structures behave under varying
amounts of symmetries. The first metric is based on the norm of the difference
between the original and symmetrized generators, while the second metric counts
depth, size, and other characteristics from the symmetrized circuits. The third
class of metrics includes expressibility and entangling capability. The results
demonstrate varying gate overhead across the studied ansatzes and confirm that
increased symmetry reduces expressibility of the circuits. In most cases,
increased symmetry increases entanglement capability. These results help select
sufficiently expressible and computationally efficient ansatze patterns for
geometric quantum machine learning applications.

Motivation: To address the challenges of space-bounded communication complexity in distributed quantum processors, ensuring practical relevance and technical non-triviality.

Method: The study models distributed quantum processors using distributed quantum circuits with nonlocal two-qubit gates and analyzes the communication complexity of unitaries by counting nonlocal gates.

Result: The paper improves the communication complexity bound for general n-qubit unitaries, demonstrates linear upper bounds for special unitaries like QFT and Clifford circuits, and shows significant reductions in communication complexity for approximation models.

Conclusion: The paper provides fundamental insights for optimizing communication in distributed quantum unitary implementation, advancing the feasibility of large-scale distributed quantum computing (DQC) systems.

Abstract: We study space-bounded communication complexity for unitary implementation in
distributed quantum processors, where we restrict the number of qubits per
processor to ensure practical relevance and technical non-triviality. We model
distributed quantum processors using distributed quantum circuits with nonlocal
two-qubit gates, defining the communication complexity of a unitary as the
minimum number of such nonlocal gates required for its realization.
  Our contributions are twofold. First, for general $n$-qubit unitaries, we
improve upon the trivial $O(4^n)$ communication bound. Considering $k$
pairwise-connected processors (each with $n/k$ data qubits and $m$ ancillas),
we prove the communication complexity satisfies $O\left(\max\{4^{(1-1/k)n - m},
n\}\right)$--for example, $O(2^n)$ when $m=0$ and $k=2$--and establish the
tightness of this upper bound. We further extend the analysis to approximation
models and general network topologies. Second, for special unitaries, we show
that both the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Clifford circuits admit
linear upper bounds on communication complexity in the exact model,
outperforming the trivial quadratic bounds applicable to these cases. In the
approximation model, QFT's communication complexity reduces drastically from
linear to logarithmic, while Clifford circuits retain a linear lower bound.
These results offer fundamental insights for optimizing communication in
distributed quantum unitary implementation, advancing the feasibility of
large-scale distributed quantum computing (DQC) systems.

Motivation: To present the first complete application of a quantum time-marching algorithm for simulating multidimensional linear transport phenomena with arbitrary boundaries.

Method: The method adapts the linear combination of unitaries algorithm to block encode diffusive dynamics and uses the method of images for arbitrary boundary conditions, requiring only one additional qubit per spatial dimension.

Result: The algorithms maintain optimal success probabilities and linear time complexity, as demonstrated through state-vector simulations of the heat equation with various boundary conditions.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the practical applicability of the quantum time-marching algorithm on fault-tolerant quantum computers, with optimal success probabilities and linear time complexity.

Abstract: This article presents the first complete application of a quantum

conditions are enforced by the method of images only at the cost of one
additional qubit per spatial dimension. As an alternative to the non-periodic
reflection, the direct encoding of Neumann conditions by the unitary
decomposition of the discrete time-marching operator is proposed. All presented
algorithms indicate optimal success probabilities while maintaining linear time
complexity, thereby securing the practical applicability of the quantum
algorithm on fault-tolerant quantum computers. The proposed time-marching
method is demonstrated through state-vector simulations of the heat equation in
combination with Neumann, Dirichlet, and mixed boundary conditions.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A protocol using GHZ states with quantum SWITCH ensures Bell violation in noisy environments, outperforming W-class states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of preserving quantum correlations (Bell nonlocality) in noisy environments, especially for quantum technologies.

Method: The study introduces the Random Access Bell Game (RABG) with noisy blocks of erasure channels and employs a quantum SWITCH protocol with entangled control-target states and sequential unsharp measurements.

Result: The protocol guarantees Bell violation after many channel applications and achieves near-maximal Bell violation at any desired round with GHZ states, highlighting their operational advantage over W-class states.

Conclusion: The protocol demonstrates a method to preserve Bell nonlocality in noisy environments using entangled GHZ states, distinguishing them from W-class states.

Abstract: Preserving quantum correlations such as Bell nonlocality in noisy
environments remains a fundamental challenge for quantum technologies. We
introduce the Random Access Bell Game (RABG), a task where an entangled
particle propagates through a sequence of identical noisy blocks, and the
ability to violate a Bell inequality is tested at a randomly chosen point
(access node). We consider a scenario where each noisy block is composed of two
complete erasure channels, an extreme entanglement-breaking channel with
vanishing quantum and classical capacities. We investigate the performance of
the Random Access Bell Game in this configuration and attempt to mitigate the
effect of noise by coherently controlling the order of each channel in the
noise using the quantum {\tt SWITCH}. However, the quantum {\tt SWITCH} in its
canonical setup with a coherent state in the control fails to provide any
advantage in the Random Access Bell Game. Our main contribution is a protocol
that leverages initial entanglement between the target and control of the
quantum {\tt SWITCH} and employs sequential, unsharp measurements on the
control system, showing that it is possible to guarantee a Bell violation after
an arbitrarily large number of channel applications. Furthermore, our protocol
allows for a near-maximal (Tsirelson bound) Bell violation to be achieved at
any desired round, while still ensuring violations in all preceding rounds. We
prove that this advantage is specific to generalized
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, as the protocol fails for W-class
states, thus providing an operational way to distinguish between these two
fundamental classes of multipartite entanglement.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the practical concern of informationally incomplete and overcomplete measurement scenarios, which can affect the assessment of classical states.

Method: The paper discusses the reconstruction of quasiprobability representations from generic measurements, including noisy ones, and introduces quasipropbabilities and nonclassicality concepts based on the measurements.

Result: The study generalizes notions like Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and s-parametrized quasiprobabilities in quantum optics, showcasing their application in single-qubit systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by demonstrating the applicability of the generalized approach to single-qubit systems, highlighting its versatility in different measurement scenarios.

Abstract: We discuss the (re-)construction of quasiprobability representations from
generic measurements, including noisy ones. Based on the measurement under
study, quasiprobabilities and the associated concept of nonclassicality are
introduced. A practical concern that we address is the treatment of
informationally incomplete and overcomplete measurement scenarios, which can
significantly alter the assessment of which states are deemed classical.
Notions, such as Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and s-parametrized
quasiprobabilities in quantum optics, are generalized by our approach.
Single-qubit systems are used to exemplify and to compare different measurement
schemes, together with the resulting quasiprobabilities and set of nonclassical
states.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing photonic cluster state generation protocols, particularly losses from coupling photonic structures, by exploring a quantum metasurface-based approach for improved efficiency and scalability.

Method: The study examines two specific protocols for generating photonic cluster states (2D and tree) using quantum metasurfaces. It leverages sub-wavelength atomic arrays to implement CNOT, CZ, and E gates with high fidelity (>0.9).

Result: Results demonstrate that the quantum metasurface approach enables high-fidelity two-qubit gates (>0.9) and potential speed-up via parallelism. Practical challenges, such as thermal fluctuations, are also analyzed.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed quantum metasurface approach for photonic cluster state generation achieves high-fidelity quantum gates and offers potential speed-up through parallelism, though practical factors like thermal fluctuations need careful consideration.

Abstract: We investigate the implementation of photonic cluster state generation
protocols using quantum metasurfaces comprising sub-wavelength atomic arrays
which enables quantum-controlled reflectivity. These cluster states are
generated using fundamental quantum logic gates and enable wide-ranging
applications in quantum computation and communication. In the past few years,
certain protocols have been developed, but their physical realizations induces
natural losses on the system mainly originated from coupling the photonic
structures, setting a limit on the efficiency and maximal qubit number. In this
paper, we examine a physical implementation of two specific protocols for
generating distinct cluster states: a two-dimensional cluster state and a tree
cluster state. Our approach leverages the unique properties of a quantum
metasurface and its free space settings to implement two-qubit quantum-logic
gates, namely CNOT, CZ, and E gates, with practical fidelities exceeding 0.9,
and potential speed-up due to parallelism. In addition, we analyze these
protocols fidelities for practical conditions of potential implementation
experiments, such as thermal fluctuation of trapped atoms.

Conclusion: 观察到相位锁定现象在共振比例条件下快速发展，通过傅里叶分析解释了这一现象。

Abstract: We study phase-synchronization in a driven two-level system coupled to a
non-Markovian bosonic reservoir. The dynamics is described by treating the
system-bath coupling and the coherent drive without invoking the rotating-wave
approximation, and simulated using the numerically exact hierarchical equations
of motion. We observe that a robust phase-locking develops and that the
corresponding synchronization measure rapidly acquires a finite value when the
system is tuned to what we identify as a resonant-ratio condition, namely when
the ratio between the drive amplitude and its frequency coincides with a zero
of the Bessel function $J_0$. We provide an explanation for this phenomenon by
means of a static approximation derived from a Fourier analysis of the
periodically driven Hamiltonian.

TL;DR: Adiabatic geometric phase gates using double-STIRAP in neutral atoms achieve high fidelity and scalability, validated through Grover's algorithm simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop robust and scalable quantum gates with enhanced resilience against fluctuations compared to conventional Rydberg blockade-based phase gates.

Method: A double stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (double-STIRAP) pulse sequence is used to imprint a controllable geometric phase on qubit systems in a neutral atom architecture, with individual addressability and no additional laser requirement for scaling.

Result: High gate fidelity (98%-99%) is achieved for gate times around 0.6 μs. The gates exhibit resilience against Rabi frequency fluctuations, finite blockade strength, and atomic position variations.

Conclusion: The proposed adiabatic geometric phase gates demonstrate strong resilience against various fluctuations, achieving high fidelity (98% to 99%) and scalability for quantum computation. The gates are validated through Grover's search algorithm simulations.

Abstract: Adiabatic geometric phase gates offer enhanced robustness against
fluctuations compared to con- ventional Rydberg blockade-based phase gates that
rely on dynamical phase accumulation. We theoretically demonstrate two- and
multi-qubit phase gates in a neutral atom architecture, relying on a double
stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (double-STIRAP) pulse sequence that imprints
a controllable geometric phase on the qubit systems. The system is designed in
such a way that every atom is individually addressable, and moreover, no extra
laser is required to be applied on the target atom while scaling up the system
from two- to multi-qubit quantum gates. The gate fidelity has been numerically
analyzed by changing the gate operation time, and we find that 98% to 99%
fidelity can be achieved for gate time $\simeq$ 0.6 $\mu$s. We perform a
systematic error analysis, which re- veals that our proposed gates can exhibit
strong resilience against fluctuations in Rabi frequencies, finite blockade
strength, and atomic position variations. These results establish our approach
as a physically feasible and scalable pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum
computation with neutral atoms. We simulate Grover's search algorithm for two-,
three-, and four-qubit systems with high success probability and thereby
demonstrate the utility and scalability of our proposed gates for quantum
computation.

TL;DR: A quantum measurement protocol minimizes measurement settings to three, independent of qubit count, leveraging Hamiltonian symmetries and tested on small systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the bottleneck caused by the exponential growth of measurement configurations with qubit number in quantum computing protocols.

Method: Derived from the symmetries of tight-binding Hamiltonians and implemented within the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm, the protocol is tested on a CuO$_2$ square lattice and bilayer graphene.

Result: The protocol successfully reduces the number of measurement settings to three and demonstrates performance on 3- and 4-qubit systems.

Conclusion: The proposed measurement protocol reduces the number of measurement settings to just three, regardless of the number of qubits, offering a path toward demonstrating quantum advantage in systems with high symmetry.

Abstract: Protocols for quantum measurement are an essential part of quantum computing.
Measurements are no longer confined to the final step of computation but are
increasingly embedded within quantum circuits as integral components of
noise-resilient algorithms. However, each observable typically requires a
distinct measurement basis, often demanding a different circuit configuration.
As the number of such configurations typically grows with the number of qubits,
different measurement configurations constitute a major bottleneck. Focusing on
electronic structure calculations in crystalline systems, we propose a
measurement protocol that maximally reduces the number of measurement settings
to just three, independent of the number of qubits. This makes it one of the
few known protocols that do not scale with qubit number. In particular, we
derive the measurement protocol from the symmetries of tight-binding (TB)
Hamiltonians and implement it within the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD)
algorithm. We demonstrate its performance on two systems, namely a
two-dimensional CuO$_2$ square lattice (3 qubits) and bilayer graphene (4
qubits). The protocol can be generalized to more complex many-body Hamiltonians
with high symmetry, providing a potential path toward future demonstrations of
quantum advantage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a multichannel qubit controller with suppressed long-term amplitude and phase drift for reliable long-duration quantum operations.

Method: The system incorporates active thermal stabilization of critical analog circuits and monitors 15 microwave output channels over 24 hours using a common analog-to-digital converter to evaluate stability.

Result: Normalized amplitude standard deviations of 0.09%--0.22% (mean: 0.15%) and phase deviations of 0.35°--0.44° (mean: 0.39°), resulting in gate infidelities of 2×10^-6 for amplitude errors and 2×10^-5 for phase errors.

Conclusion: QuEL-1 SE demonstrates significant amplitude and phase stability, with gate infidelities well below typical fault-tolerance thresholds, proving its utility as a scalable control platform for superconducting and other qubit modalities.

Abstract: We present the design and performance of QuEL-1 SE, which is a multichannel
qubit controller developed for superconducting qubits. The system incorporates
the active thermal stabilization of critical analog integrated circuits, such
as phase-locked loops, amplifiers, and mixers, to suppress the long-term
amplitude and phase drift. To evaluate the amplitude and phase stability, we
simultaneously monitor 15 microwave output channels over 24 h using a common
analog-to-digital converter. Across the channels, the normalized amplitude
exhibits standard deviations of 0.09\%--0.22\% (mean: 0.15\%), and the phase
deviations are 0.35$^\circ$--0.44$^\circ$ (mean: 0.39$^\circ$). We further
assess the impact of these deviations on quantum gate operations by estimating
the average fidelity of an $X_{\pi/2}$ gate under the coherent errors
corresponding to the deviations. The resulting gate infidelities are $2\times
10^{-6}$ for amplitude errors and $2\times 10^{-5}$ for phase errors, which are
significantly lower than typical fault-tolerance thresholds such as those of
the surface code. These results demonstrate that the amplitude and phase
stability of QuEL-1 SE enables reliable long-duration quantum operations, thus
highlighting its utility as a scalable control platform for superconducting and
other qubit modalities.

TL;DR: A quantum-search based secret-sharing framework is analyzed and improved, but complete security against eavesdropping is proven impossible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing quantum secret-sharing protocols, which either rely on statistical analysis over multiple rounds or require secure communication channels. The goal is to enhance the resistance of the protocol against eavesdropping.

Method: The authors provide a complete characterization of the correctness and security properties of the quantum-search based secret-sharing framework, leading to improvements in the original protocol.

Result: The analysis shows that while the protocol can be improved, it cannot achieve complete security against eavesdropping.

Conclusion: The study concludes that while the quantum-search based secret-sharing framework by Hsu (2003) can be improved for better resistance against eavesdropping, complete security remains unachievable within this framework.

Abstract: Secret-sharing schemes allow a dealer to split a secret into multiple
"shares" and distribute them individually among many parties while mandating
certain constraints on its reconstruction. Such protocols are usually executed
over a secure communication channel since an eavesdropper, after intercepting
all the shares, is expected to be able to reconstruct the secret. Leveraging
the unique properties of quantum channels, several quantum protocols have been
designed for secret sharing. However, almost all of them detect the presence of
an eavesdropper by statistical analysis of the outcome of multiple rounds, or
simply require a secure channel of communication.
  We present a complete characterisation of the correctness and security
properties of a quantum-search based secret-sharing framework proposed by Hsu
(2003). The scheme was designed to work over public channels without requiring
multiple rounds to detect eavesdropping. Our characterisation allowed us to
improve the original protocol to be more resistant towards eavesdropping.
However, we prove that complete security against an eavesdropper is not
possible in this framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the limitation of quantum data hiding can be overcome with additional quantum resources, such as entangled catalysts or quantum memory.

Method: The authors develop a general framework for state discrimination that unifies catalytic and memory-assisted protocols, analyzing their power to reveal hidden information.

Result: For separable hiding states, neither entangled catalysts nor quantum memory improve discrimination. However, for some entangled states, quantum memory enables almost perfect discrimination.

Conclusion: The paper establishes that separable data-hiding schemes are robust against enhancement from entangled catalysts or quantum memory, while entangled states can be more effectively discriminated with reusable quantum memory.

Abstract: Quantum data hiding stores classical information in bipartite quantum states
that are, in principle, perfectly distinguishable, yet remain almost
indistinguishable without access to a quantum communication channel. Here, we
investigate whether this limitation can be overcome when the communicating
parties are assisted by additional quantum resources. We develop a general
framework for state discrimination that unifies catalytic and memory-assisted
local discrimination protocols and analyze their power to reveal hidden
information. We prove that when the hiding states are separable, neither
entangled catalysts nor quantum memory can increase the optimal discrimination
probability, establishing the robustness of separable data-hiding schemes. In
contrast, for some entangled states, a reusable quantum memory turns locally
indistinguishable states into ones that can be discriminated almost perfectly.
Our results delineate the fundamental limits of catalytic and memory-assisted
state discrimination and identify separable encodings as a robust strategy for
quantum data hiding.

Abstract: Exactly solvable models of topologically ordered phases with non-abelian
anyons typically require complicated many-body interactions which do not
naturally appear in nature. This motivates the "inverse problem" of quantum
many-body physics: given microscopic systems with experimentally realistic
two-body interactions, how to design a Hamiltonian that realizes a desired
topological phase? Here we solve this problem on a platform motivated by
Rydberg atoms, where elementary two-level systems couple via simple blockade
interactions. Within this framework, we construct Hamiltonians that realize
topological orders described by non-abelian quantum double models. We
analytically prove the existence of topological order in the ground state, and
present efficient schemes to prepare these states. We also introduce protocols
for the controlled adiabatic braiding of anyonic excitations to probe their
non-abelian statistics. Our construction is generic and applies to quantum
doubles $\mathcal{D}(G)$ for arbitrary finite groups $G$. We illustrate
braiding for the simplest non-abelian quantum double $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$.

TL;DR: The paper connects privacy tests and k-extendible states to derive tight, computable bounds for quantum secure communication metrics, improving on known results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limits of secure communication in quantum information theory by determining the maximum probability of k-extendible states passing privacy tests and deriving computable bounds for distillable key and private capacity.

Method: The paper leverages the notions of privacy tests and k-extendible states to derive maximum probabilities and fidelities, coupling these with the resource theory of k-unextendibility.

Result: The maximum probability of k-extendible states passing privacy tests equals the fidelity with the maximally entangled state. Efficiently computable upper bounds for one-shot and n-shot distillable key and private capacity are established, outperforming existing bounds in certain cases.

Conclusion: The paper establishes efficiently computable upper bounds for one-shot and n-shot distillable key and private capacity, proving them to be tighter than existing bounds in key examples.

Abstract: The notions of privacy tests and $k$-extendible states have both been
instrumental in quantum information theory, particularly in understanding the
limits of secure communication. In this paper, we determine the maximum
probability with which an arbitrary $k$-extendible state can pass a privacy
test, and we prove that it is equal to the maximum fidelity between an
arbitrary $k$-extendible state and the standard maximally entangled state. Our
findings, coupled with the resource theory of $k$-unextendibility, lead to an
efficiently computable upper bound on the one-shot, one-way distillable key of
a bipartite state, and we prove that it is equal to the best-known efficiently
computable upper bound on the one-shot, one-way distillable entanglement. We
also establish efficiently computable upper bounds on the one-shot,
forward-assisted private capacity of channels. Extending our formalism to the
independent and identically distributed setting, we obtain single-letter
efficiently computable bounds on the $n$-shot, one-way distillable key of a
state and the $n$-shot, forward-assisted private capacity of a channel. For
some key examples of interest, our bounds are significantly tighter than other
known efficiently computable bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of distinguishing between simulable and non-simulable POVMs, where existing tools are inefficient or limited.

Method: A hierarchy of semidefinite programs is introduced to certify non-simulability, with practical experimental validation using a trapped-ion qudit quantum processor.

Result: The method provides upper bounds on non-simulability measures, outperforming previous criteria and demonstrating experimental feasibility.

Conclusion: The study successfully introduces a general method to certify non-simulability of POVMs, demonstrating its effectiveness through theoretical and experimental results.

Abstract: Determining the conditions under which positive operator-valued measures
(POVMs), the most general class of quantum measurements, outperform projective
measurements remains a challenging and largely unresolved problem. Of
particular interest are projectively simulable POVMs, which can be realized
through probabilistic mixtures of projective measurements, and therefore offer
no advantage over projective schemes. Characterizing the boundary between
simulable and non-simulable POVMs is, however, a difficult task, and existing
tools either fail to scale efficiently, provide limited experimental
feasibility or work only for specific POVMs. Here, we introduce and demonstrate
a general method to certify non-simulability of a POVM by introducing a
hierarchy of semidefinite programs. It provides upper bounds on the
non-simulability measure of critical visibility of arbitrary POVMs which are
tight in many cases and outperform previously known criteria. We experimentally
certify the non-simulability of two- and three-dimensional POVMs using a
trapped-ion qudit quantum processor by constructing non-simulability witnesses
and introduce a modification of our framework that makes them robust against
state preparation errors. Finally, we extend our results to the setting where
an additional ancilla system is available.

Motivation: To leverage the complementary advantages of ensemble-based quantum memories for fast multiplexed entanglement generation and single-atomic systems for information processing, enhancing high-rate entanglement generation in quantum networks.

Method: Develop a hybrid architecture combining trapped-ion nodes and nodes with spontaneous parametric down conversion photon pair sources and absorptive memories based on rare-earth ion ensembles, addressing bandwidth matching challenges.

Result: The approach enables parallel execution of probabilistic tasks and achieves a significant speed-up in creating ion-ion entanglement over hundreds of kilometers.

Conclusion: The hybrid architecture combining trapped-ion nodes and ensemble-based systems significantly speeds up ion-ion entanglement generation over long distances in quantum networks.

Abstract: Different quantum systems possess different favorable qualities. On the one
hand, ensemble-based quantum memories are suited for fast multiplexed
long-range entanglement generation. On the other hand, single-atomic systems
provide access to gates for processing of information. Both of those can
provide advantages for high-rate entanglement generation within quantum
networks. We develop a hybrid architecture that takes advantage of these
properties by combining trapped-ion nodes and nodes comprised of spontaneous
parametric down conversion photon pair sources and absorptive memories based on
rare-earth ion ensembles. To this end, we solve the central challenge of
matching the different bandwidths of photons emitted by those systems in an
initial entanglement-generation step. This enables the parallel execution of
multiple probabilistic tasks in the initial stage. We show that our approach
can lead to a significant speed-up for the fundamental task of creating ion-ion
entanglement over hundreds of kilometers in a quantum network.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的视角，通过偏置态的概念重新审视了混合量子经典方法（MQC），阐明了其成功的原因以及改进的途径，为更可靠的MQC策略提供了系统化的路线。

Abstract: Beyond the adiabatic regime, our understanding of quantum dynamics in coupled
systems remains limited, and the choice of representation continues to obscure
physical interpretation and simulation accuracy. Here we propose a natural and
efficient basis for electron nuclear dynamics by drawing on the concepts of
pointer and preferred states from decoherence theory, adapted to systems where
electrons and nuclei interact strongly. Within this framework, we show that 1)
the independent dynamics exploited by mixed quantum classical (MQC) methods is
best understood as a manifestation of entanglement viewed in a preferred basis,
rather than a consequence of decoherence, and 2) the adiabatic Born Oppenheimer
states satisfy the conditions of an approximate preferred basis. This
perspective reconciles widely used approximations with a more fundamental
structure of the theory and provides a systematic route to more reliable MQC
strategies. In effect, we revisit MQC methods through the lens of preferred
states, clarifying when they succeed and how they can be improved.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing tools for hybrid quantum-classical experiments on NISQ devices, which often hide configuration or require ad-hoc scripting, and to support systematic, hypothesis-driven study of quantum algorithms.

Method: The Quantum Experiment Framework (QEF) is introduced, capturing key aspects of quantum software and algorithm experiments through a concise specification that expands into a Cartesian product of variants for controlled parameter sweeps. It supports iterative, exploratory analysis and automates large-scale parameter sweeps with hyper-parameter traceability.

Result: QEF enables rigorous and systematic evaluation, precise reproducibility, and efficient parameter reuse while collecting metrics and metadata for easy exploration with standard statistical tools.

Conclusion: QEF successfully lowers practical barriers for empirical research on quantum algorithms by ensuring reproducibility and scalability, while avoiding the complexity of full workflow engines.

Abstract: Commercially available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices now
make small hybrid quantum-classical experiments practical, but many tools hide
configuration or demand ad-hoc scripting.
  We introduce the Quantum Experiment Framework (QEF): A lightweight framework
designed to support the systematic, hypothesis-driven study of quantum
algorithms. Unlike many existing approaches, QEF emphasises iterative,
exploratory analysis of evolving experimental strategies rather than exhaustive
empirical evaluation of fixed algorithms using predefined quality metrics. The
framework's design is informed by a comprehensive review of the literature,
identifying principal parameters and measurement practices currently reported
in the field.
  QEF captures all key aspects of quantum software and algorithm experiments
through a concise specification that expands into a Cartesian product of
variants for controlled large-scale parameter sweeps. This design enables
rigorous and systematic evaluation, as well as precise reproducibility. Large
sweeps are automatically partitioned into asynchronous jobs across simulators
or cloud hardware, and ascertain full hyper-parameter traceability. QEF
supports parameter reuse to improve overall experiment runtimes, and collects
all metrics and metadata into a form that can be conveniently explored with
standard statistical and visualisation software.
  By combining reproducibility and scalability while avoiding the complexities
of full workflow engines, QEF seeks to lower the practical barriers to
empirical research on quantum algorithms, whether these are designed for
current NISQ devices or future error-corrected quantum systems.

TL;DR: Researchers developed wideband homodyne detectors for high-speed quantum information processing, demonstrating their ability to operate at 150 MHz repetition rates and resolve spectral multimode properties of squeezed light at telecom wavelengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to overcome the limitations of conventional homodyne detectors, which struggle with high-speed quantum information processing due to electronic constraints, particularly in pulsed operation at high repetition rates.

Method: The researchers designed and implemented wideband homodyne detectors optimized for near-infrared and telecom wavelengths, capable of operating at repetition rates up to 150 MHz. They tested the detectors by resolving pulse-by-pulse structures of squeezed states of light at telecom wavelengths.

Result: The results showed that the wideband homodyne detectors successfully operated at high repetition rates (up to 150 MHz) and preserved the spectral multimode properties of squeezed states of light at telecom wavelengths.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the developed wideband homodyne detectors are effective for high-speed quantum information processing, as demonstrated by their successful operation at high repetition rates and ability to resolve spectral multimode properties.

Abstract: Homodyne detection is a phase-sensitive measurement technique, essential for
the characterization of continuous-variable (CV)-encoded quantum states of
light. It is a key component to the implementation of CV quantum-information
protocols and benefits from operating, by design, at room temperature. However,
performing high-speed quantum information processing remains a major challenge,
as conventional homodyne detectors often fail to sustain pulsed operation at
high repetition rates due to electronic limitations. We present wideband
homodyne detectors operating at near-infrared (NIR) and telecom wavelengths,
with optimized performance at repetition rates up to 150 MHz. We demonstrate
their performance by resolving the pulse-by-pulse structure of squeezed states
of light at telecom wavelengths while preserving their spectral multimode
properties.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Canopus is a qubit mapping/routing framework that reduces overhead by 15%-35% by leveraging advanced ISAs and a canonical gate representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing compiler methods ignore the idiosyncrasies of native gates, leading to inefficiencies. Advanced ISAs offer superior circuit synthesis but lack systematic compiler optimizations.

Method: Uses a unified qubit mapping/routing framework based on the canonical representation of two-qubit gates and the monodromy polytope to model synthesis cost.

Result: Canopus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different ISAs and topologies.

Conclusion: Canopus reduces routing overhead by 15%-35% and provides a coherent method for co-exploration of program patterns, quantum ISAs, and hardware topologies.

Abstract: Qubit mapping/routing is a critical stage in compilation for both near-term
and fault-tolerant quantum computers, yet existing scalable methods typically
impose several times the routing overhead in terms of circuit depth or
duration. This inefficiency stems from a fundamental disconnect: compilers rely
on an abstract routing model (e.g., three-$ \mathrm{CX} $-unrolled SWAP
insertion) that completely ignores the idiosyncrasies of native gates supported
by physical devices.
  Recent hardware breakthroughs have enabled high-precision implementations of
diverse instruction set architectures (ISAs) beyond standard
$\mathrm{CX}$-based gates. Advanced ISAs involving gates such as
$\mathrm{\sqrt{iSWAP}}$ and $\mathrm{ZZ}(\theta)$ gates offer superior circuit
synthesis capabilities and can be realized with higher fidelities. However,
systematic compiler optimization strategies tailored to these advanced ISAs are
lacking.
  To address this, we propose Canopus, a unified qubit mapping/routing
framework applicable to diverse quantum ISAs. Built upon the canonical
representation of two-qubit gates, Canopus centers on qubit routing to perform
deep co-optimization in an ISA-aware approach. Canopus leverages the two-qubit
canonical representation and the monodromy polytope to model the synthesis cost
for more intelligent $ \mathrm{SWAP} $ insertion during the routing stage. We
also formalize the commutation relations between two-qubit gates through the
canonical form, providing a generalized approach to commutativity-based
optimizations. Experiments show that Canopus consistently reduces routing
overhead by 15\%-35\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across different
ISAs and topologies. Our work also presents a coherent method for
co-exploration of program patterns, quantum ISAs, and hardware topologies.

### [79] [Unclonable Cryptography in Linear Quantum Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04633)
*Omri Shmueli,Mark Zhandry*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper reduces quantum key size for one-shot signatures using coset states, minimizing persistent memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum cryptography requires minimization of persistent quantum memory due to decoherence. Current protocols for quantum signing tokens and one-shot signatures demand large quantum memory, prompting the need for more efficient solutions.

Method: The authors develop novel techniques for proving the security of cryptosystems using coset states, a key tool in unclonable cryptography.

Result: The proposed techniques reduce the quantum secret key size, achieving asymptotically optimal size in certain scenarios.

Conclusion: The study significantly reduces the quantum secret key size for one-shot signatures and quantum signing tokens, achieving asymptotically optimal size in some cases, thus minimizing the persistent quantum memory required.

Abstract: Quantum cryptography is a rapidly-developing area which leverages quantum
information to accomplish classically-impossible tasks. In many of these
protocols, quantum states are used as long-term cryptographic keys. Typically,
this is to ensure the keys cannot be copied by an adversary, owing to the
quantum no-cloning theorem. Unfortunately, due to quantum state's tendency to
decohere, persistent quantum memory will likely be one of the most challenging
resources for quantum computers. As such, it will be important to minimize
persistent memory in quantum protocols.
  In this work, we consider the case of one-shot signatures (OSS), and more
general quantum signing tokens. These are important unclonable primitives,
where quantum signing keys allow for signing a single message but not two.
Naturally, these quantum signing keys would require storage in long-term
quantum memory. Very recently, the first OSS was constructed in a classical
oracle model and also in the standard model, but we observe that the quantum
memory required for these protocols is quite large. In this work, we
significantly decrease the quantum secret key size, in some cases achieving
asymptotically optimal size. To do so, we develop novel techniques for proving
the security of cryptosystems using coset states, which are one of the main
tools used in unclonable cryptography.

*Koki Okada,Kenta Kasai*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Local modifications via cross-swaps and repairs create scalable randomized quantum LDPC codes, preserving weight distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To preserve matrix row and column weight distributions, crucial for belief-propagation decoding performance, while introducing structural randomness.

Method: The method involves small $2 	imes 2$ cross-swap operations and integer-linear-program-based local repairs to introduce structural randomness while maintaining orthogonality.

Result: Ensembles of randomized quantum LDPC codes can be constructed with computational complexity independent of matrix size, ensuring scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables the scalable construction of randomized quantum LDPC codes by preserving matrix weight distributions through local modifications.

Abstract: We propose a method for modifying orthogonal sparse matrix pairs used in CSS
codes while preserving their matrix row and column weight distributions, which
play a crucial role in determining the performance of belief-propagation
decoding. Unlike simple row or column permutations that merely reorder existing
elements, the proposed local modification introduces genuine structural
randomness through small $2\times2$ cross-swap operations followed by
integer-linear-program-based local repairs that restore orthogonality. By
applying this procedure repeatedly in a random manner, ensembles of randomized
quantum LDPC codes can be constructed. The computational complexity of each
repair depends only on the maximum row and column weights and is independent of
the overall matrix size, ensuring scalability to large code blocks.

Result: 提出并实现了多个非局域多光子量子门，揭示了类似量子隐形传态的新机制。

Conclusion: 自动化发现系统在物理学中可以提供新的思想和技术，路径不可区分性成为分布式量子信息处理的实用资源。

Abstract: Interactions between quantum systems enable quantum gates, the building
blocks of quantum information processing. In photonics, direct photon-photon
interactions are too weak to be practically useful, so effective interactions
are engineered with linear optics and measurement. A central challenge is to
realize such interactions non-locally, i.e., between photons that remain
spatially separated. We present experimental proposals for several essential
non-local multiphoton quantum gates that act on spatially separated photons, in
both qubit and high-dimensional qudit systems. All solutions were discovered by
the AI-driven discovery system called PyTheus. Rather than using pre-shared
entanglement or Bell state measurements, our gates use as a resource quantum
indistinguishability by path identity - a technique that exploits coherent
superpositions of the photon pair origins. While analyzing these solutions, we
uncovered a new mechanism that mimics much of the properties of quantum
teleportation, without shared entanglement or Bell state measurements.
Technically, our results establish path indistinguishability as a practical
resource for distributed quantum information processing; conceptually, they
demonstrate how automated discovery systems can contribute new ideas and
techniques in physics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索挤压光的时间局域化描述，并研究其对光子对相关性的影响。

Method: 使用Whittaker-Shannon分解提供时间局域化的描述，计算了正交方差、连续波极限下的符合探测概率，并分析了强挤压光下的Hong-Ou-Mandel效应。

Result: 正交不确定性在强挤压下进一步低于散粒噪声极限，而光子对相关性在弱挤压下最为显著。

Conclusion: 本文通过Whittaker-Shannon分解和光子对的时间特性分析，扩展了先前的结果，并提出了在更广泛场景下的应用。

Abstract: The Whittaker-Shannon decomposition provides a temporally localized
description of squeezed light, making it applicable in the CW limit and leading
to a definition of squeezing strength based on the number of photon pairs at a
time. We show examples of its usefulness by calculating quadrature variance in
a homodyne detection scheme, coincidence detection probabilities in the
continuous-wave limit, and analyzing the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect for strongly
squeezed light. Quadrature uncertainty falls farther below the shot noise limit
when squeezing is strong, but effects due to correlations between photon pairs
are most significant with weak squeezing. Our analysis extends previous results
to more general scenarios, and we leverage the Whittaker-Shannon formalism to
interpret them based on the temporal properties of photon pairs.

Conclusion: 该论文通过开发一个框架，利用任务的对称性，展示了一种新的量子查询复杂度上界方法，而无需显式依赖SDP对偶性。实验结果解决了学习隐藏字符串问题的多个子集变体，并与已知结果匹配。

Abstract: In the search with wildcards problem [Ambainis, Montanaro, Quantum
Inf.~Comput.'14], one's goal is to learn an unknown bit-string $x \in
\{-1,1\}^n$. An algorithm may, at unit cost, test equality of any subset of the
hidden string with a string of its choice. Ambainis and Montanaro showed a
quantum algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ and a near-matching lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Belovs [Comput.~Comp.'15] subsequently showed a tight
$O(\sqrt{n})$ upper bound.
  We consider a natural generalization of this problem, parametrized by a
subset $\cal{Q} \subseteq 2^{[n]}$, where an algorithm may test whether $x_S =
b$ for an arbitrary $S \in \cal{Q}$ and $b \in \{-1,1\}^S$ of its choice, at
unit cost. We show near-tight bounds when $\cal{Q}$ is any of the following
collections: bounded-size sets, contiguous blocks, prefixes, and only the full
set.
  All of these results are derived using a framework that we develop. Using
symmetries of the task at hand we show that the quantum query complexity of
learning $x$ is characterized, up to a constant factor, by an optimization
program, which is succinctly described as follows: `maximize over all odd
functions $f : \{-1,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ the ratio of the maximum value of $f$
to the maximum (over $T \in \cal{Q}$) standard deviation of $f$ on a subcube
whose free variables are exactly $T$.'
  To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to use the primal
version of the negative-weight adversary bound (which is a maximization program
typically used to show lower bounds) to show new quantum query upper bounds
without explicitly resorting to SDP duality.

### [84] [Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03783)
*Xuhao Jiang,Jad C. Halimeh,N. S. Srivatsa*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Krylov complexity is a sensitive probe of confinement in the Ising model, showing distinct behaviors in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and quantify confinement behavior in condensed matter systems using Krylov complexity as a novel probe.

Method: The study employs the Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields to analyze Krylov state complexity growth following quenches in different phases.

Result: Confinement suppresses Krylov complexity growth in the ferromagnetic phase, while it enhances complexity in the paramagnetic phase. Oscillations in complexity match meson masses, validating semiclassical predictions.

Conclusion: Krylov complexity is demonstrated as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement in the Ising model, with distinct behaviors observed in ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases.

Abstract: In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental
particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free,
isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in
certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both
transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into
meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear
potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov
state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under
the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a
sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement
manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following
quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal
field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within
the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal
field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point
to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by
orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement.
Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies
corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely
matching the semiclassical predictions.

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: This paper analyzes leaf degree distributions in random recursive trees and a new leaf-based growth model, revealing factorial decay in RRTs and varied tail behaviors in the growth model, with potential future extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the role of leaves in graph structure, especially in sparse settings, and to explore the leaf degree distribution by introducing a leaf-based counterpart to the degree. The study aims to compare the leaf degree distribution of RRTs with a newly proposed growth model.

Method: The study employs probabilistic analysis and growth models to determine the leaf degree distribution of random recursive trees (RRTs) and a new leaf-based preferential attachment model. The model parameters are varied to observe different tail behaviors in the leaf degree distribution.

Result: The results show that RRT leaf degree distributions decay factorially, while the leaf-based growth model exhibits powerlaw tails for 0 < a < 1, exponential tails with algebraic prefactors for a > 1, and stretched exponential tails for the critical case a = 1.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the leaf degree distribution in random recursive trees (RRTs) and a leaf-based preferential attachment model exhibits distinct behaviors, such as factorial decay in RRTs and powerlaw or exponential tails in the leaf-based growth model. The study also conjectures asymptotic equivalence of degree and leaf degree powerlaw tail exponents and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Leaves, i.e., vertices of degree one, can play a significant role in graph
structure, especially in sparsely connected settings in which leaves often
constitute the largest fraction of vertices. We consider a leaf-based
counterpart of the degree, namely, the leaf degree -- the number of leaves a
vertex is connected to -- and the associated leaf degree distribution,
analogous to the degree distribution. We determine the leaf degree distribution
of random recursive trees (RRTs) and trees grown via a leaf-based preferential
attachment mechanism that we introduce. The RRT leaf degree distribution decays
factorially, in contrast with its purely geometric degree distribution. In the
one-parameter leaf-based growth model, each new vertex attaches to an existing
vertex with rate $\ell$ + a, where $\ell$ is the leaf degree of the existing
vertex, and a > 0. The leaf degree distribution has a powerlaw tail when 0 < a
< 1 and an exponential tail (with algebraic prefactor) for a > 1. The critical
case of a = 1 has a leaf degree distribution with stretched exponential tail.
We compute a variety of additional characteristics in these models and
conjecture asymptotic equivalence of degree and leaf degree powerlaw tail
exponent in the scale free regime. We highlight several avenues of possible
extension for future studies.

TL;DR: Lossy compression of stochastic signals via optimal thresholding shows trade-offs between information retention and cost, with universal scaling and potential non-Gaussian advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the trade-offs in lossy compression of fluctuating stochastic signals and the efficiency of discrete representations.

Method: Numerical optimization using genetic algorithms and analytical high-rate expansion to determine optimal threshold density.

Result: Pareto-optimal trade-offs between mutual information and encoding cost, with piecewise convex intrusions in the small-noise regime and universal cube-root scaling.

Conclusion: Optimal thresholding for lossy compression of stochastic signals reveals Pareto-optimal trade-offs, with universal cube-root scaling and potential advantages over Gaussian surrogates.

Abstract: I investigate the generic problem of lossy compression of a fluctuating
stochastic signal $X$ into a discrete representation $Z$ through optimal
thresholding. The signal modulates transition rates of a two-state system
described by a binary variable $Y$. Optimising the retained mutual information
between $Z$ and $Y$ under a constraint on fixed encoding cost of $Z$ reveals
Pareto-optimal trade-offs, determined numerically using genetic algorithms. In
the small-noise regime, these fronts are either concave or exhibit piecewise
convex ``intrusions'' separated by first-order transitions in the optimal
protocol. An analytical high-rate expansion shows that the optimal threshold
density follows a universal cube-root scaling with the product of the prior
distribution and the Fisher information associated with the response, which
holds qualitatively even for few discrete states. Extending the analysis to
non-Gaussian fluctuations reveals that for some parameters optimal encoders can
yield strictly better information-cost trade-offs than Gaussian surrogates,
meaning the same information content can often be achieved with fewer discrete
readout states.

*Pedro Gatón-Pérez,Enrique Rodriguez-Fernandez,Rodolfo Cuerno*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Study of conserved stochastic evolution equations shows parameter-dependent strong coupling behavior, with numerical evidence of vertex renormalization for odd n and zero skewness in height fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the occurrence of strong coupling or nonlinear scaling behavior in kinetically rough interfaces with conserved dynamics, extending beyond the stochastic Burgers equation (n=0).

Method: The authors formulate a family of conserved stochastic evolution equations for one-dimensional interfaces, perform a one-loop dynamical renormalization group analysis, and conduct numerical simulations for n=1, 2, and 3.

Result: For odd n (1 and 3), numerical results suggest vertex renormalization. The height fluctuations exhibit zero skewness and non-Gaussian kurtosis, indicating strong coupling behavior. The zero skewness is attributed to space symmetries or emergent symmetries at strong coupling.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the family of conserved stochastic evolution equations exhibits strong coupling scaling behavior dependent on parameter n. Numerical simulations for n=1 and 3 suggest vertex renormalization, unlike n=0 and 2. The height fluctuations show zero skewness but non-Gaussian kurtosis, supporting strong coupling asymptotic behavior.

Abstract: The occurrence of strong coupling or nonlinear scaling behavior for
kinetically rough interfaces whose dynamics are conserved, but not necessarily
variational, remains to be fully understood. Here we formulate and study a
family of conserved stochastic evolution equations for one-dimensional
interfaces, whose nonlinearity depends on a parameter n, thus generalizing that
of the stochastic Burgers equation, whose behavior is retrieved for n=0. This
family of equations includes as particular instances a stochastic porous medium
equation and other continuum models relevant to various hard and soft condensed
matter systems. We perform a one-loop dynamical renormalization group analysis
of the equations, which contemplates strong coupling scaling exponents that
depend on the value of $n$ and may or may not imply vertex renormalization.
These analytical expectations are contrasted with explicit numerical
simulations of the equations with n=1,2, and 3. For odd n, numerical stability
issues have required us to generalize the scheme originally proposed for n=0 by
T. Sasamoto and H. Spohn. Precisely for n=1 and 3, and at variance with the n=0
and 2 cases (whose numerical exponents are consistent with non-renormalization
of the vertex), numerical strong coupling exponent values are obtained which
suggest vertex renormalization, akin to that reported for the celebrated
conserved KPZ equation. We also study numerically the statistics of height
fluctuations, whose probability distribution function turns out (at variance
with cKPZ) to have zero skewness for long times and at saturation, irrespective
of the value of n. However, the kurtosis is non-Gaussian, further supporting
the conclusion on strong coupling asymptotic behavior. The zero skewness seems
related with space symmetries of the n=0 and 2 equations, and with an emergent
symmetry at the strong coupling fixed point for odd values of n.

*Paul Fendley,Sascha Gehrmann,Eric Vernier,Frank Verstraete*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Simplified proof of XYZ spin-chain integrability via matrix-product operators, with extensions to impurities and boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the proof of integrability for the XYZ quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian and explore its implications for impurity interactions and boundary conditions, bridging traditional methods with new approaches.

Method: The authors constructed an extensive sequence of conserved charges using a matrix-product operator and demonstrated their commutation with the XYZ Hamiltonian under various boundary conditions. They also generalized the approach to include impurity interactions while maintaining integrability.

Result: The paper successfully constructs conserved charges for the XYZ Hamiltonian, generalizes integrability to impurity interactions, and connects the matrix-product operator approach with the eight-vertex model transfer matrix.

Conclusion: This paper provides a simplified derivation of the integrability of the XYZ quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian by constructing an extensive sequence of conserved charges from a matrix-product operator. It also generalizes the approach to include impurity interactions, offering new insights into integrable systems and connecting with traditional methods.

Abstract: Sutherland showed that the XYZ quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian commutes with
the eight-vertex model transfer matrix, so that Baxter's subsequent tour de
force proves the integrability of both. The proof requires parametrising the
Boltzmann weights using elliptic theta functions and showing they satisfy the
Yang-Baxter equation. We here give a simpler derivation of the integrability of
the XYZ chain by explicitly constructing an extensive sequence of conserved
charges from a matrix-product operator. We show that they commute with the XYZ
Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions or an arbitrary boundary magnetic
field. A straightforward generalisation yields impurity interactions that
preserve the integrability. Placing such an impurity at the edge gives an
integrable generalisation of the Kondo problem with a gapped bulk. We make
contact with the traditional approach by relating our matrix-product operator
to products of the eight-vertex model transfer matrix.
