### [1] [Structural changes in the Lennard-Jones supercooled liquid and ideal glass: an improved integral equation for the replica method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22548)
*Bomont Jean-Marc,Bretonnet Jean-Louis,Costa Dino,Pastore Giorgio*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper explores the structural properties of the Lennard-Jones fluid at ultra-low temperatures using a modified HMSA theory, identifying an fcc-like short-range order in the ideal glass phase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to advance the understanding of glass formation by studying the structural properties of the Lennard-Jones fluid at extremely low temperatures.

Method: The authors used a replicated version of the refined HMSA theory combined with a specific pair potential split to analyze the structural properties of the Lennard-Jones fluid in the supercooled liquid and ideal-glass phases.

Result: A density-dependent temperature was identified where the radial distribution function showed structural changes, including an additional peak between the main and second peaks, indicating an fcc-like short-range order in the ideal glass phase.

Conclusion: The study identifies a structural transition in the Lennard-Jones fluid at very low temperatures, revealing an fcc-like short-range order in the ideal glass phase without long-range order.

Abstract: Framing the glass formation within standard statistical mechanics is an outstanding problem of condensed matter theory. To provide new insight, we investigate the structural properties of the Lennard-Jones fluid in the very-low temperature regime, by using a replicated version of the refined HMSA theory of the liquid state, combined with an appropriate split of the pair potential [Bomont and Bretonnet, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 4141 (2001)]. Our scheme allows one to reach an unprecedented low-temperature domain within both the supercooled liquid and the ideal-glass phase. Therein, a density-dependent temperature is identified, whereupon the radial distribution function experiences clear-cut structural changes, insofar as an additional peak develops in between the main and the second peaks. Such a structural feature points to a local structure of the Lennard-Jones ideal glass with an fcc-like short-range order, in the absence of any long-range order.

Motivation: 探索微观决策规则对并行少数者游戏动态的影响

Method: 数值研究

Result: 不同规则产生不同普适性类，阈值机制作为相关扰动作用于DP。

Conclusion: 

Abstract: The Parallel Minority Game (PMG) is a synchronous adaptive multi-agent model that exhibits active-absorbing transitions characteristic of non-equilibrium statistical systems. We perform a comprehensive numerical study of the PMG under two families of microscopic decision rules: (i) agents update their choices based on instantaneous population in their alternative choices, and (ii) threshold-based activation that activates agents movement only after overcrowding density crossing a threshold. We measure time-dependent and steady state limits of activity $A(t)$, overcrowding fraction $F(t)$ as functions of the control parameter $g=N/D$, where $N$ is the number of agents and $D$ is the total number of sites. Instantaneous rules display mean-field directed-percolation (MF-DP) scaling with $β\approx1.00$, $δ\approx0.5$, and $ν_{\parallel}\approx2.0$. Threshold rules, however, produce a distinct non-mean-field universality class with $β\approx0.75$ and a systematic failure of MF-DP dynamical scaling. We show that thresholding acts as a relevant perturbation to DP. The results highlight how minimal cognitive features at the agent level fundamentally alter large-scale critical behaviour in socio-economic and active systems.

Motivation: pass

Method: cocycle+Bo

Result: ok

Conclusion: good

Abstract: Based on a cocycle structure, we identify a new derivation of the Boltzmann distribution for finite energy-level systems from the maximal entropy principle (MEP). Our approach does not rely on the method of the Lagrange multiplier, and it provides a more transparent way to understand the dependence on the energy levels of the temperature $T = 1/β$ for the equilibrium distribution. Finally, we make two curious observations associated with our derivations.

### [4] [Geometric decomposition of information flow for overdamped Langevin systems and optimal transport in subsystems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22890)
*Sosuke Ito,Yoh Maekawa,Ryuna Nagayama,Andreas Dechant,Kohei Yoshimura*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper extends the geometric decomposition of information flow to overdamped Langevin systems, linking it to optimal transport theory. It introduces excess and housekeeping demons and derives new thermodynamic relations, illustrated with the Gaussian case.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend the geometric decomposition of information flow, previously introduced for Markov jump systems, to overdamped Langevin systems. The goal is to provide an optimal-transport interpretation of subsystem dynamics and generalize the second law of information thermodynamics.

Method: The paper applies the geometric decomposition of information flow to overdamped Langevin systems, linking it to the $2$-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. It also utilizes representations based on the Koopman mode decomposition and explores the relationship with the Fisher information matrix.

Result: The results include a simpler optimal-transport formulation for overdamped Langevin systems, the generalization of the second law of information thermodynamics, and the derivation of a thermodynamic uncertainty relation and an information-thermodynamic speed limit. The Gaussian case is illustrated to demonstrate these findings.

Conclusion: This paper concludes by generalizing the second law of information thermodynamics using excess and housekeeping information flow, introducing the concept of excess and housekeeping demons, and deriving a thermodynamic uncertainty relation and an information-thermodynamic speed limit. It also discusses the conditions for the emergence of these demons.

Abstract: Information flow between subsystems is a central concept in information thermodynamics, which provides the second-law-like inequalities for subsystems. This paper discusses the geometric decomposition of information flow, which was introduced for Markov jump systems [Y Maekawa, R Nagayama, K Yoshimura and S Ito, arXiv:2509.21985 (2025)], and applies it to overdamped Langevin systems. For overdamped Langevin systems, the geometric decomposition of information flow into excess and housekeeping contributions is related to the conventional definition of the $2$-Wasserstein distance between marginal distributions in optimal transport theory. This formulation offers an optimal-transport interpretation of subsystem dynamics, and this optimal-transport formulation is simpler for overdamped Langevin systems than for general Markov jump systems. It is also possible to handle features that are specific to overdamped Langevin systems, such as representations based on the Koopman mode decomposition, as well as their relationship with the Fisher information matrix. As with the results for Markov jump systems, we generalize the second law of information thermodynamics using housekeeping and excess information flow, leading to the concept of excess and housekeeping demons. We also derive a thermodynamic uncertainty relation and an information-thermodynamic speed limit incorporating excess information flow. These results are illustrated for the Gaussian case, and we discuss the conditions under which the excess and housekeeping demons emerge.

### [5] [Effective Kinetic Monte Carlo for a Quantum Epidemic Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22950)
*Alexander Sturges,Hugo Smith,Matteo Marcuzzi*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: A simple quantum epidemic model is developed, showing classical epidemic-like stationary features but with richer dynamics like recurrent waves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work is inspired by previous research on epidemic-like processes in open quantum systems, aiming to develop a simple quantum epidemic model for large-scale simulations.

Method: The paper derives an elementary quantum epidemic model and uses Quantum Jump Monte Carlo simulations. Weak symmetries of the Lindblad equation are exploited to map the dynamics onto a classical Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, enabling local stochastic and deterministic descriptions.

Result: The model's phase diagram shows features equivalent to classical epidemic processes along with more complex dynamics, such as recurrent waves of infection.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the quantum epidemic model exhibits stationary features similar to classical epidemic processes but with richer dynamics, including multiple recurrent infection waves.

Abstract: Inspired by previous works on epidemic-like processes in open quantum systems, we derive an elementary quantum epidemic model that is simple enough to be studied via Quantum Jump Monte Carlo simulations at reasonably large system sizes. We show how some weak symmetries of the Lindblad equation allow us to map the dynamics onto a classical Kinetic Monte Carlo; this simplified, effective dynamics can be described via local stochastic jumps coupled with a local deterministic component. Simulations are then used to reconstruct a phase diagram which displays stationary features completely equivalent to those of completely classical epidemic processes, but richer dynamics with multiple, recurrent waves of infection.

Motivation: 动机

Method: 方法

Result: 结果

Conclusion: 总结

Abstract: We introduce the eigen microstate entropy ($S_{\text{EM}}$), a novel metric of complexity derived from the probabilities of statistically independent eigen microstates. After establishing its scaling behavior in equilibrium systems and demonstrating its utility in critical phenomena (mean spherical, Ising, and Potts models), we apply $S_{\text{EM}}$ to non-equilibrium complex systems. Our analysis reveals a consistent precursor signal: a significant increase in $S_{\text{EM}}$ precedes major phase transitions. Specifically, we observe this entropy rise before biomolecular condensate formation in liquid-liquid phase separation in living cells and months ahead of El Niño events. These findings position $S_{\text{EM}}$ as a general framework for detecting and interpreting phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems.

### [7] [The Geometric Foundations of Microcanonical Thermodynamics: Entropy Flow Equation and Thermodynamic Equivalence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23127)
*Loris Di Cairano*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper introduces a geometric approach to microcanonical thermodynamics, linking entropy to phase space geometry and uncovering thermodynamic covariance and equivalence, validated through practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a geometric basis for microcanonical thermodynamics, replacing the traditional ensemble postulate, and to systematically analyze how the geometry of energy manifolds influences thermodynamics and phase transitions.

Method: The study develops a geometric foundation for measuring constant-energy manifolds, using entropy and its derivatives derived from phase space geometry, and introduces deterministic entropy flow equations driven by curvature invariants.

Result: The framework reveals thermodynamic covariance under descriptive choices and establishes geometric microcanonical equivalence, demonstrating its utility in reconstructing microcanonical response and identifying criticality in various systems.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a geometric framework for microcanonical thermodynamics, highlighting how phase transitions and thermodynamic covariance emerge from energy manifold geometry, with practical applications demonstrated across diverse systems.

Abstract: We develop a geometric foundation of microcanonical thermodynamics in which entropy and its derivatives are determined from the geometry of phase space, rather than being introduced through an a priori ensemble postulate. Once the minimal structure needed to measure constant -- energy manifolds is made explicit, the microcanonical measure emerges as the natural hypersurface measure on each energy shell. Thermodynamics becomes the study of how these shells deform with energy: the entropy is the logarithm of a geometric area, and its derivatives satisfy a deterministic hierarchy of entropy flow equations driven by microcanonical averages of curvature invariants (built from the shape/Weingarten operator and related geometric data). Within this framework, phase transitions correspond to qualitative reorganizations of the geometry of energy manifolds, leaving systematic signatures in the derivatives of the entropy.
  Two general structural consequences follow. First, we reveal a thermodynamic covariance: the reconstructed thermodynamics is invariant under arbitrary descriptive choices such as reparametrizations and equivalent representations of the same conserved dynamics. Second, a geometric microcanonical equivalence is found: microscopic realizations that share the same geometric content of their energy manifolds (in the sense of entering the curvature sources of the flow) necessarily yield the same microcanonical thermodynamics. We demonstrate the full practical power of the formalism by reconstructing microcanonical response and identifying criticality across paradigmatic systems, from exactly solvable mean-field models to genuinely nontrivial short-range lattice field theories and the 1D long-range XY model with $1/r^α$ interactions.

### [8] [Survey on Lattice Gas Models on 2D Lattices: Critical Behavior of Closed Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23129)
*Zoey Zhou*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper explores critical behavior in 2D Lorentz lattice gases, revealing scale-free statistics and fractal geometry with specific critical exponents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the rich dynamical regimes of Lorentz lattice gases (LLGs), particularly their critical behavior with scale-free statistics and fractal geometry at special scatterer concentrations.

Method: The study focuses on the numerical analysis of closed trajectories in two-dimensional Lorentz lattice gases (LLGs), building on the work of Cao and Cohen, and explores their relation to percolation-hull scaling and kinetic hull-generating walks.

Result: Critical behavior is observed with specific exponents (τ=15/7, df=7/4, σ=3/7) in universality classes, along with alternative exponents in partially occupied models.

Conclusion: The survey highlights the scaling hypothesis for loop-length distributions and the emergence of critical exponents (τ=15/7, df=7/4, σ=3/7) in several universality classes, along with alternative exponents in partially occupied models.

Abstract: Lorentz lattice gases (LLGs) are discrete-time transport models in which a point particle moves ballistically between lattice sites and is scattered by randomly placed, quenched local scatterers such as ``rotators'' or ``mirrors.'' Despite the elementary update rules, LLGs exhibit rich dynamical regimes: typically, trajectories close quickly and the distribution of loop lengths has exponential tails, but at special concentrations of scatterers one observes critical behavior with scale-free statistics and fractal geometry. This survey focuses on the critical behavior of closed trajectories in two-dimensional LLGs, starting from the numerical study of Cao and Cohen, and its relation to percolation-hull scaling and kinetic hull-generating walks. We highlight the scaling hypothesis for loop-length distributions, the emergence of critical exponents $τ=15/7$, $d_f=7/4$, and $σ=3/7$ in several universality classes, and the appearance of alternative exponents in partially occupied models.

### [9] [Renormalization group approach to graphene bilayers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23349)
*L. Delzescaux,D. Mouhanna*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The paper uses NPRG to study thermal fluctuations in graphene bilayers, revealing a rigidity crossover and demonstrating advantages over SCSA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to investigate the effects of thermal fluctuations in graphene bilayers, addressing limitations of the self-consistent screening approximation (SCSA) used in previous work.

Method: The study uses a nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) approach to analyze the thermal fluctuations in graphene bilayers, focusing on a model of two continuum polymerized membranes coupled by interlayer interactions.

Result: The analysis reveals a crossover in the effective bending rigidity, transitioning from high-scale in-plane elastic dominance to low-scale monolayer bending rigidity, within a renormalization group framework.

Conclusion: It concludes that the NPRG approach provides a more robust framework for analyzing bilayer graphene's thermal fluctuations compared to SCSA, with potential for systematic improvement.

Abstract: We investigate the effects of thermal fluctuations in graphene bilayers by means of a nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) approach, following the pioneering work of Mauri et al. [Phys. Rev. B 102, 165421 (2020)] based on a self-consistent screening approximation (SCSA). We consider a model of two continuum polymerized membranes, separated by a distance $\ell$, in their flat phase, coupled by interlayer shear, compression/dilatation and elastic terms. Within a controlled truncation of the effective average action, we retain only the contributions that generate a pronounced crossover of the effective bending rigidity along the renormalization group flow between two regimes: at high running scale $k$, the rigidity is dominated by the in-plane elastic properties, with $κ_{\mathrm{eff}}\sim \ell^{2}(λ+2μ)/2$, whereas at low $k$ it is controlled by the bending rigidity of two independent monolayers, $κ_{\mathrm{eff}}\sim 2κ$. This crossover is reminiscent of that observed by Mauri et al. as a function of the wavevector scale $q$, but here it is obtained within a renormalization group framework. This has several advantages. First, although approximations are performed, the NPRG approach allows one, in principle, to take into account all nonlinearities present in the elastic theory, in contrast to the SCSA treatment which requires, already at the formal level, significant simplifications. Second, it demonstrates that the bilayer problem can be treated as a straightforward extension of the monolayer case, with flow equations that keep the same structure and differ only by bilayer-specific adjustments. Third, unlike the SCSA, the NPRG framework admits a controlled, systematically improvable, hierarchy of approximations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We establish universal scaling laws and quantify aging in three-dimensional uniformly heated hard sphere granular gases through large-scale event-driven molecular dynamics ($N=500{,}000$). We report three primary quantitative discoveries: (i) The characteristic energy decay time exhibits a universal inverse scaling $τ_0 \propto ε^{-1.03 \pm 0.02}$ with the dissipation parameter $ε= 1 - e^2$. (ii) The steady-state temperature follows a precise power-law $T_{\mathrm{steady}} \propto ε^{-1.51 \pm 0.03}$, reflecting the non-linear balance between thermostat heating and collisional dissipation. (iii) The velocity autocorrelation function $\bar{A}(τ_w, τ)$ demonstrates pronounced aging, with decay rates $λ$ following a power-law slowing down $λ(τ_w) \propto τ_w^{-0.82 \pm 0.05}$. These results establish the first 3D quantitative benchmarks for aging in driven dissipative gases, where near-Gaussian statistics persist despite extreme structural clustering.

### [11] [Ergodicity Breaking in Active Run-and-Tumble Particles in a Double-Well Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23641)
*Urna Basu,Satya N. Majumdar,Alberto Rosso*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Active particles in a double-well potential show strong ergodicity breaking above a critical barrier height, with behavior dependent on initial conditions. Below this threshold, ergodicity is restored, and barrier crossing times violate standard laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how active dynamics (run-and-tumble particles) differ from Brownian particles in a double-well potential, particularly regarding ergodicity breaking and barrier crossing behavior.

Method: Investigation of run-and-tumble particle dynamics in a double-well potential, analyzing long-time position distributions, hitting probabilities, and deriving analytical solutions for stationary distributions and barrier crossing times.

Result: Strong ergodicity breaking occurs above a critical barrier height, with the system's long-time behavior depending on initial conditions. Below the threshold, ergodicity is restored, and barrier crossing times exhibit non-Arrhenius behavior with a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann-like divergence.

Conclusion: The study reveals that active dynamics in a double-well potential can induce strong ergodicity breaking, with the long-time position distribution depending on initial conditions. Below a critical barrier height, ergodicity is restored, and the system converges to a unique stationary distribution. The barrier crossing time violates Kramer's-Arrhenius law and shows anomalous behavior near the critical height.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a run-and-tumble particle in a double-well potential and demonstrate that, in stark contrast to Brownian particles, active dynamics can lead to strong ergodicity breaking. When the barrier height exceeds a critical threshold, the long-time position distribution depends crucially on the initial condition: if the particle starts within the basin of attraction of one well, it remains trapped there, while if it begins between the two basins, it can reach either well with a finite probability, which we compute exactly via hitting probabilities. Below the critical barrier height, ergodicity is restored and the system converges to a unique stationary distribution, which we derive analytically. Using this result, we also estimate the characteristic barrier crossing time and show that it violates Kramer's-Arrhenius law, and displays a divergence near the critical height following a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann-like form with an anomalous exponent $1/2$.

*Xinghai Zhang,Ziyan Zhu,Justin H. Wilson,Matthew S. Foster*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The research demonstrates that quasiperiodicity and topology induce critical behavior in twisted trilayer graphene, facilitating robust superconductivity across a broad range of twist angles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to systematically study the superconducting properties of twisted trilayer graphene (TTG)

Method: large-scale wave function and Kubo conductivity calculations

Result: TTG enters a critical regime marked by multifractal wave functions and scale-invariant transport, enabling superconductivity over a wide range of twist angles

Conclusion: Twisted multilayer moiré materials exhibit peculiar superconducting properties due to the interplay between quasiperiodicity and topology.

Abstract: Twisted multilayer moiré materials are generically quasiperiodic on the moiré scale due to the interference of different misaligned moiré periodicities. Spatial inhomogeneities such as these can be detrimental to superconductivity; nonetheless, superconductivity has been observed in quasiperiodic twisted trilayer graphene (TTG). Here, we systematically study the superconducting properties of TTG. We reveal that an interplay between quasiperiodicity and topology drives TTG into a critical regime, enabling it to host superconductivity with rigid phase stiffness for a wide range of twist angles, rather than at a fine-tuned value. The criticality in the normal state is due to the Dirac fermions coupled by quasiperiodic tunneling simulating 3D topological superconductor surface states. This critical-metal regime is marked by multifractal wave functions across the spectrum and scale-invariant transport reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition. We demonstrate this with large-scale wave function and Kubo conductivity calculations. These observations lead to a clear experimental implication: stronger interlayer coupling in TTG further stabilizes both the criticality and superconductivity, allowing superconductivity to be seen across a wider range of angles with experimentally accessible pressures.

TL;DR: Cryogenic EFM reveals and characterizes defects in aluminum oxide, aiding in the identification of charge noise sources to improve qubit coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum dot qubits in semiconductors suffer from coherence limitations due to charge noise from defects in gate dielectrics. Characterizing these defects is crucial for improving qubit performance.

Method: The study employs cryogenic electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) to characterize aluminum oxide grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on bulk silicon. Detailed electrostatic modeling is used to map tip-backgate charging voltages onto defect transition energies.

Result: Measurements reveal defects near the surface that exchange electrons with the EFM tip, enabling identification of defects like aluminum vacancies and carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen impurities via comparison with DFT.

Conclusion: EFM is identified as a powerful tool for exploring defect structures in solid-state qubits, offering atomic-scale spatial resolution and spectral sensitivity to charge noise sources.

Abstract: The coherence of quantum dot qubits fabricated in semiconductors is often limited by charge noise from defects in gate dielectrics, which are material- and process-dependent. Characterizing these defects is an important step towards reducing their impact and improving qubit coherence. The identification of individual defects requires atomic-scale spatial resolution, however, and sufficient spectral sensitivity to determine their electronic structure. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) provides highly resolved maps of the surface potential of dielectrics, and importantly, is also sensitive to single-electron charging processes that reflect the spectral structure of underlying defects. In this work, we use cryogenic EFM to characterize aluminum oxide grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on bulk silicon. These measurements reveal defects close to the surface that exchange electrons with the EFM tip as they transition through different charge states. Detailed electrostatic modeling opens the door to powerful techniques for mapping tip-backgate charging voltages onto defect transition energies, allowing defects such as aluminum vacancies, and carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen impurities to be identified, by comparing to density functional theory (DFT). These results point towards EFM as a powerful tool for exploring defect structures in solid-state qubits.

TL;DR: The paper investigates anisotropic IR intensity distributions using PiF-IR, revealing enhanced absorption effects and molecular alignment contributions, supported by quantum calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the anisotropic intensity distributions observed in nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods and the role of hybrid field coupling and molecular alignment in these phenomena.

Method: The research utilized PiF-IR hyperspectral imaging on aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates, alongside quantum chemical calculations to model oriented vibrational oscillators.

Result: Enhanced IR absorption was observed on surfaces perpendicular to the propagation of p-polarized illumination, explaining anisotropic intensity distributions. PiF-IR's high resolution allowed visualization of nanoscale chemical variations.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that PiF-IR combines high spatial and spectral resolution to visualize nanoscale chemical variations, providing insights into anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces. Quantum chemical calculations support the interpretation of these anisotropic effects.

Abstract: Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution < 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.

TL;DR: Hf/Zr-based gate stacks (HZH and HZHA) meet advanced transistor requirements, achieving low EOT, leakage suppression, and Vth tunability, surpassing conventional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of meeting three key requirements for advanced logic transistors—compatibility with high-temperature processing, Vth tunability, and high device reliability—was not achievable with conventional high-k systems.

Method: Demonstrated the use of Hf/Zr-based gate stacks, specifically HZH superlattice and HZHA with embedded Al2O3 dipole, to achieve sub-nanometer EOT, leakage suppression, and Vth tunability.

Result: HZH achieved an EOT of 7.3 Å, and HZHA achieved an EOT of 8.4 Å with a flatband voltage shift >200 mV, confirming strong Vth tunability and stability under stress.

Conclusion: HZHA gate stacks are established as an RMG-compatible, Vth-tunable, low-EOT dielectric platform capable of supporting logic scaling beyond the 1 nm frontier.

Abstract: Advanced logic transistors require gate dielectrics that achieve sub-nanometer equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), suppress leakage, and satisfy three key requirements: (i) compatibility with RMG-like high-temperature processing, (ii) sufficient Vth tunability for multi-Vth design, and (iii) high device reliability. However, meeting all of these requirements simultaneously has been difficult with conventional high-k systems. In this work, we demonstrate that Hf/Zr-based gate stacks quantitatively satisfy these conditions. After a 700 C N2 anneal, the HZH superlattice achieves an EOT of 7.3 A, lower than conventional HfO2-only stacks (8.5 A) while maintaining comparable leakage. Embedding a 3 A Al2O3 dipole within an HfO2/ZrO2/HfO2 superlattice (HZHA) breaks the conventional dipole trade-off, achieving an EOT of 8.4 A, lower than the 9.0 A of a standard HfO2/Al2O3 stack, while providing a flatband voltage shift greater than 200 mV, thereby enabling multi-Vth tuning without compromising scaling. Furthermore, under -2 V negative-bias temperature stress at 125 C for 100 s, HZHA and HA exhibit comparable flatband voltage drifts of 87 mV and 97 mV, respectively, confirming that strong Vth tunability and sub-nanometer EOT can be achieved without compromising stability. In addition to these quantitative advances, this study reveals previously unreported physical insights into dipole behavior and interfacial diffusion in ultrathin Hf/Zr multilayers. These results establish HZHA as an RMG-compatible, Vth-tunable, low-EOT dielectric platform capable of supporting logic scaling beyond the 1 nm frontier.

Abstract: The optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been customarily calculated ab initio using plane waves and without separating the most important orbitals contributions. In the family of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) monolayers lacking inversion symmetry, we take advantage of the mostly d-orbital content of the Bloch bands around the semiconductor gap to reduce the calculation of the linear and quadratic optical susceptibilities to a very minimal model. Such a simple approach reproduces well first principles calculations and could be the starting point for the inclusion of many-body effects and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in TMDCs with only a few energy bands in a numerically inexpensive way.

Motivation: To explore the fundamental properties and tunability of pseudogauge barriers in graphene nanoslides for straintronics applications.

Method: Solving the scattering problem in closed form for a graphene nanoslide, analyzing the hybrid pseudogauge and electrostatic cavity effects.

Result: The nanoslide forms a tunable hybrid cavity with valley chiral or counterpropagating modes and 1D flatbands, exhibiting gate-dependent local density of states and sublattice asymmetry.

Conclusion: The nanoslide device enables tunable control of valley chiral modes, counterpropagating modes, and flatbands, with potential applications in graphene straintronics and quantum transport.

Abstract: We present a theory of the graphene nanoslide, a fundamental device for graphene straintronics that realizes a single pseudogauge barrier. We solve the scattering problem in closed form and demonstrate that the nanoslide gives rise to a hybrid pseudogauge and electrostatic cavity in the bipolar regime, and hosts one-dimensional transverse channels. The latter can be tuned using a bottom gate between valley chiral or counterpropagating modes, as well as one-dimensional flatbands. Hence, the local density of states near the barrier depends strongly on the gate voltage with a tunable sublattice and electron-hole asymmetry. In the presence of electron-electron interactions, the nanoslide allows for in-situ tuning between a chiral and ordinary Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid.

Abstract: We investigate the superconducting Anderson impurity model for interacting quantum dot Josephson junctions with spin-orbit coupling and a term accounting for tunnelling through higher-energy orbitals. These elements establish the conditions required for spin polarization in the absence of external magnetic field at finite superconducting phase bias. This Hamiltonian has been previously used to model the Andreev spin qubit, where quantum information is encoded in spinful odd-parity subgap states. Here we instead analyse the even-parity sector, i.e., the Andreev pair qubit based on Andreev bound states (ABS). The model is solved using the zero-bandwidth approximation and the numerical renormalization group, with further insight from variational calculations. Electron-electron interaction admixes single-occupancy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) components into the ABS states, thereby strongly enhancing spin transitions in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The ABS states can thus become sensitive to local magnetic field fluctuations, which has implications for decoherence in Andreev pair qubits. For strong interaction $U$, especially in the cross-over region between the ABS and YSR regimes for $U \sim 2Δ$, charge, spin, and inductive transitions can all become strong, offering avenues for spin control and quantum transduction.

Abstract: In the present study, we apply shortcut to adiabaticity pulses (time-dependent Rabi frequency and detuning) for the efficient population transfer from the ground to the exciton state in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum dot with phonon-induced dephasing. We use the time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method to propagate system in time and find that, for temperatures below $ 20 \ \text{K} $ and pulse duration up to $ 10 \ \text{ps} $, a very good transfer efficiency is obtained in general. We explain these results using a Bloch-like equation derived from a generalized Lindblad equation, which adequately describes system dynamics at lower temperatures. For higher temperatures, the transfer efficiency is significantly reduced except for subpicosecond pulses, where the shortcut Rabi frequency reduces to a delta pulse attaining a fast population inversion. The present work is expected to find application in quantum technologies which exploit quantum dots for single-photon generation on demand.

Abstract: We predict a new class of topological electronic crystals in bilayer graphene-Mott insulator heterostructures. Interlayer charge transfer creates a charge neutral electron hole bilayer, in which itinerant carriers in graphene interact attractively with localized carriers from a flat Hubbard band. In the heavy fermion limit and dilute limit, this interplay leads to symmetry breaking crystalline phases stabilized not only by pure repulsion, but also by interlayer Coulomb attraction shaped by band topology. Using comprehensive Hartree Fock calculations, we uncover triangular, honeycomb, and kagome charge orders hosting different quantized anomalous Hall effects at moderate interlayer attraction.

Motivation: To expand the limited number of materials exhibiting topological edge states by discovering new topologies like 3D QSHIs.

Method: Density functional theory calculations and scanning tunneling microscopy experiments were used to analyze the topology and observe edge states.

Result: Topological edge states were observed in α-Bi₄I₄, showing helical character and robustness against defects and vertical stacking.

Conclusion: The study identifies α-Bi₄I₄ as the first material realization of a 3D quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), demonstrating robust topological edge states resistant to defects and stacking interactions, with potential for quantum devices.

Abstract: Topologically protected edge channels show prospects for quantum devices. They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal.

Abstract: Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor qubits have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional platforms, combining material advantages with device-level tunability. A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing. While many designs remain at proof-of-concept stage, rapid progress suggests practical demonstrations may soon be achievable.

Motivation: To determine altermagnetic order and its unique spin response, which requires atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces.

Method: Spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy using helical edge modes of a higher-order topological insulator as a spin sensor.

Result: Demonstrated the dual-space feature of a layered d-wave altermagnet, KV₂Se₂O, including checkerboard antiferromagnetic order and d-wave spin splitting of the band structure.

Conclusion: The experiments establish a solid basis for exploring and utilizing altermagnetism in layered materials, facilitating atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulation of 2D quantum materials.

Abstract: Altermagnetism simultaneously possesses nonrelativistic spin responses and zero net magnetization, thus combining advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism. Our experiments establish a solid basis for the exploration and utilization of altermagnetism in layered materials and further facilitate access to atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulating of 2D quantum materials.

Abstract: We study polaritonic bound states in the continuum (BIC) created in GaN waveguides. The existence of symmetry-protected BICs is confirmed by the suppression of light emission and the observation of a polarization vortex in momentum space. Upon increasing the pumping, polariton population accumulates at the BIC and we observe polariton lasing from the blueshifted BIC states. The assessment of the polariton BIC emission energy and of its momentum broadening as a function of pumping power, i.e. of polariton density, indicates the formation of a bright soliton above the lasing threshold. Soliton formation at the BIC is induced by the combination of negative mass BIC and of repulsive polariton-polariton interactions.

Motivation: To challenge the conventional belief that the QAH effect is exclusive to insulators and explore its potential in metallic systems.

Method: Theoretical demonstration utilizing a six-terminal Hall bar to analyze the coexistence of chiral edge channels and isotropic bulk conduction channels.

Result: Quantized Hall conductivity and nonzero longitudinal conductivity emerge due to dephasing, with the Hall conductivity showing robustness against disorder.

Conclusion: The study extends the range of materials capable of hosting the QAH effect from insulators to metals, offering new insights for experimental realization at elevated temperatures.

Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect holds fundamental importance in topological physics and technological promise for electronics. It is generally believed that the QAH effect can only be realized in insulators. In this Letter, we theoretically demonstrate that the QAH effect can also be realized in metallic systems, representing a phase distinct from the conventional QAH phase in insulators. This phase is characterized by the coexistence of chiral edge channels and isotropic bulk conduction channels without a bulk energy gap. Notably, in a six-terminal Hall bar, our calculations show that, the quantized Hall conductivity and nonzero longitudinal conductivity can emerge due to dephasing, despite the Hall resistivity itself never becoming quantized. Furthermore, the quantized Hall conductivity exhibits remarkable robustness against disorder. Our findings not only extend the range of materials capable of hosting the QAH effect from insulators to metals, but also provide insights that may pave the way for the experimental realization of the QAH effect at elevated temperatures.

Conclusion: yes

Abstract: Ultrafast electric manipulation of magnetic order in solids is critical for the development of future terahertz data processing. A fascinating concept for such high-speed operation is offered in metallic antiferromagnets by Néel spin-orbit torque. It should allow one to coherently rotate the ordered spins by simply applying an electric current of suitable amplitude and polarity. However, such switching has been severely hampered by competing heat-induced effects, and it has not yet been achieved on the intrinsically ultrafast time scales of antiferromagnets. Here, we report robust, direction-controlled and non-thermal rotation of the Néel vector $\mathbf{L}$ by $\pm$90° at room temperature in the antiferromagnet Mn$_2$Au driven by phase-locked terahertz current pulses. All observed features are consistent with ultrafast Néel spin-orbit torque: First, nonlinear optical imaging reveals that the terahertz current direction sets the final orientation of $\mathbf{L}$ in the absence of any bias field for at least two months. Second, transient optical birefringence shows that the switching proceeds ultrafast in less than 15 picoseconds. Finally, atomistic spin-dynamics simulations reproduce the observed dynamics and confirm the minor role of thermal effects. While the switching is already one order of magnitude faster than in ferromagnets at comparable dissipated energy, our simulations predict routes toward switching times and energies which are another order of magnitude lower. Our approach can be transferred to electric-field-driven switching in many more antiferromagnets, including magnetoelectric insulators. The engineering of spin torques, resonance frequencies and read-out mechanisms provides an exciting pathway toward on-chip applications of terahertz antiferromagnetic spin-orbitronics.

Motivation: Conventional chemical doping techniques hinder the reversibility and density of excitonic charge states in 2D semiconductors, necessitating a more efficient method.

Method: Doping monolayer WS2 using water rinsed PVA and applying high periodic biaxial strain through a 2D silica microsphere array.

Result: Nearly 100% reversible trion-to-exciton conversion, thermally stable trions with a binding energy of ~56 meV, and a 41% boost in trion emission.

Conclusion: This approach establishes a versatile platform for excitonic charge state conversion and enhanced quasiparticle density in 2D materials, offering promising opportunities for future optical data storage, quantum-light and display technologies.

Abstract: Controllable quasiparticle radiation in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for efficient carrier recombination, tunable emission, and modulation of valley polarization which are strongly determined by both the density and nature of underlying excitonic species. Conventional chemical doping techniques, however, often hinder the reversibility and density of excitonic charge states (exciton and trion) due to unfavorable interactions between dopant and 2D materials. In this work, efficient excitonic charge state conversion is achieved by doping monolayer WS$_2$ using water rinsed PVA and the quasiparticle densities are further enhanced by applying high periodic biaxial strain (up to 2.3%) through a 2D silica microsphere array. The method presented here enables nearly 100% reversible trion-to-exciton conversion without the need of electrostatic gating, while delivering thermally stable trions with a large binding energy of ~56 meV and a high free electron density of ~3$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. Strain-induced funneling of the PVA-injected free electrons substantially increases the excitonic quasiparticle densities and boosts the trion emission by 41%. Overall, this approach establishes a versatile platform for excitonic charge state conversion and enhanced quasiparticle density in 2D materials, offering promising opportunities for future optical data storage, quantum-light and display technologies.

Method: Numerical simulation of the coherent control of a Ge hole spin using surface acoustic waves, analyzing the strain-dependent modulation of the g-tensor matrix and its effects on spin rotation.

Result: The study demonstrates that periodic strain from surface acoustic waves dynamically modulates the g-tensor matrix, enabling fast spin rotation with small acoustic amplitudes. It also reveals strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency.

Conclusion: The work establishes the foundation for acoustic-driven spin control and spin-phonon coupling in Ge hole spin qubits, highlighting their potential for fast and efficient quantum operations.

Abstract: Germanium hole spin qubits based on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well have attracted much research attention due to the strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the strain dependence of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing and thus the $g$-tensor anisotropy offer unique opportunities for acoustic driving and spin-phonon coupling. In this work we numerically simulate the coherent control of a Ge hole spin using surface acoustic waves. The periodic strain dynamically modulates the $g$-tensor matrix and causes fast spin rotation under a small acoustic amplitude. Moreover, we show a strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency coming from the phase-shifted longitudinal and shear strain components. Our work lays the foundations for acoustic-driven spin control and spin-phonon coupling using Ge hole spin qubits.

Motivation: To investigate the interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in coupled condensates, leading to emergent ac Josephson-like effects without external bias.

Method: Utilized a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates to uncover dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations, analyzing static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states.

Result: Identified an ac phase with two distinct frequencies breaking time-translation symmetry, featuring bias-free oscillatory currents, and hysteretic transitions between phases with different winding numbers.

Conclusion: The study establishes a foundation for exploring novel dynamical phases driven by nonreciprocity in condensate platforms, highlighting the emergence of bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents and hysteretic transitions between phases.

Abstract: We report an emergent ac Josephson-like effect arising without external bias, driven by the interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in coupled condensates. Using a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates, we uncover a rich landscape of dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations. This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime. Interestingly, the transition is hysteretic: phases with different winding numbers destabilize under distinct conditions, reflecting their inherently different nonlinear structures. Our work lays the foundation for exploring nonreciprocity-driven novel dynamical phases in a broad class of condensate platforms.

Method: The paper analyzes the Bloch vector and its winding number by relating them to the gradient of the energy dispersion, which is proportional to the group velocity.

Result: The results show a mapping between the energy gradient and the Bloch vector, implying a direct relation between two-band Hamiltonians and topological structures.

Conclusion: The study establishes a direct and measurable relation between two-band Hamiltonians and their topological structures through the energy gradient and Bloch vector.

Abstract: Two-band Hamiltonians provide a typical description of topological band structures, in which the eigenfunctions can be characterized by a %Bloch vector field whose winding number that defines an integer topological invariant. This winding number is quantized and protected against continuous deformations of the Hamiltonian. Here we show that the Bloch vector and its winding number can be directly related to the gradient of the energy dispersion. Since the energy gradient is proportional to the group velocity, our result establishes an experimentally accessible correspondence between the Bloch vector field and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. We discuss a mapping between the gradient of the energy dispersion and the Bloch vector. This implies a direct and measurable relation between two-band Hamiltonians and their underlying topological structures.

*Ashwin Mohan,Radha S*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: TbAgAl exhibits a disordered magnetic state under high fields due to competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, attributed to its layered structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the magnetic state of the TbAgAl compound within the RAgAl series, particularly its behavior under high magnetic fields and low temperatures.

Method: Magnetization measurements were conducted up to 12 Tesla in the temperature range 2K-300K, and electrical resistivity measurements were performed up to 9 Tesla in the same temperature range.

Result: The magnetization data indicate an antiferromagnetic state transitioning to ferromagnetic above a critical field, with large coercivity and non-saturation, suggesting a disordered state. Transport measurements further support the presence of competing interactions.

Conclusion: The study reveals a disordered magnetic state in TbAgAl due to competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, supported by magnetization and transport measurements. The layered structure of the compound likely contributes to this behavior.

Abstract: In order to further investigate the magnetic state of the RAgAl series, the magnetization measurements on the TbAgAl compound from this series have been extended to higher fields of 12 Tesla in the temperature range 2K-300K. The electrical resistivity in the temperature range 2-300K has been measured up to fields of 9 Tesla. The field dependence of magnetization at low temperatures suggests an antiferromagnetic state undergoing a metamagnetic transition to a ferromagnetic state above the critical field. The observation of large coercivity (unlike other compounds in the RAgAl series) and non-saturation of magnetization indicates a disordered magnetic state having both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. The presence of competing interactions leading to a disordered state is also supported by transport measurements and is attributed presumably to the layered structure of the compound.

Motivation: Coulomb interaction in low-D quantum materials produce bound states

Method: time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (t-ARPES)

Result: Detected dynamically induced trions via bright in-gap state

Conclusion: optical excitation driving trion formation mechanism without doping, Fluency→dependent exciton/trion competitio

Abstract: Strong Coulomb interactions in low-dimensional quantum materials give rise to emergent bound states such as excitons and trions, which play a central role in correlated electronic phases. In quasi-one-dimensional systems, equilibrium photoemission studies have reported signatures of trions, suggesting an unusually robust state, as opposed to conventional semiconductors where trions typically appear only as excited states stabilized by carrier doping. Here, we show that optical excitation of undoped Ta2NiS5 - a correlated quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor - generates a pronounced and long-lived trion population, demonstrating that such states can be dynamically induced even in the absence of doping. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we track the dynamics of a bright, localized in-gap state that emerges following photoexcitation and identify it as a transient trion population. We uncover an unconventional trion formation pathway and a fluence-dependent competition between trions and excitons. These findings extend ultrafast quasiparticle photoemission spectroscopy to complex bound states in bulk quantum materials, enabling the dynamical control of charged and neutral excitations.

Conclusion: 结构分析

Abstract: Frustrated Kondo lattices are ideal platforms for studying how both the Kondo effect and quantum fluctuations compete with the magnetic exchange interactions that drive magnetic ordering. Here, we investigate the effect of tuning the heavy-fermion compound CePdIn, which crystallizes in the geometrically frustrated ZrNiAl-type structure, using applied magnetic fields and hydrostatic pressure. At ambient pressure, CePdIn exhibits two magnetic transitions, one at $T_{\rm{N}} \approx 1.65$ K and another at $T_{\rm{M}} \approx 1.15$ K, which are both suppressed by applied $c$-axis fields. Upon applying pressure in zero magnetic field, there is a non-monotonic evolution of $T_{\rm{N}}$, which decreases to 0.8 K at 2.3 GPa, before abruptly increasing to 1.5 K at 2.6 GPa. At higher pressures, $T_{\rm{N}}$ has a weak pressure dependence, and vanishes near 5 GPa. Together with the high-pressure phase being more robust to applied fields, these results suggest two distinct antiferromagnetic phases in CePdIn, which are separated near 2.6 GPa, and this change may be driven by the evolution of the underlying electronic structure due to enhanced Kondo hybridization under pressure.

Abstract: Kagome metals exhibit rich correlated-electron physics, yet a systematic understanding of the degree of correlation across transition-metal species remains elusive. Using density-functional theory plus multi-orbital slave-spin mean-field theory, we investigate electronic correlations in the Ti-, V-, and Cr-based 135 compounds with Sb and Bi pnictogens. We find that the significantly stronger degree of correlation of the Cr-based materials compared to Ti and V can only be explained through the synergy of two effects: the larger electron filling of the $d$-shell and the reduced characteristic kinetic energy. We put forward that the substitution of Sb with Bi strengthens correlations in all compounds and make the prediction that the-yet-to-be-synthesized CsCr$_3$Bi$_5$ must be the most strongly correlated member of the entire family. These findings provide a quantitative, band-structure-based framework for understanding and predicting correlation strength in Kagome metals.

Motivation: To bridge the divide between p- and d-electron systems and uncover their deep underlying unity in condensed matter physics.

Result: Demonstrates that p- and t2g orbitals share nearly identical hopping physics and spin-orbit coupling, enabling unified understanding across diverse materials.

Conclusion: The p-t2g homology serves as both an interpretive tool and a design principle for engineering novel quantum states.

Abstract: The nominal divide between $p$- and $d$-electron systems often obscures a deep underlying unity in condensed matter physics. This review elucidates the orbital homology between the $p$ and $t_{2g}$ orbital manifolds, establishing the correspondence that extends from minimal model Hamiltonians to the complex behaviors of real quantum materials. We demonstrate that despite their distinct atomic origins, these orbitals host nearly identical hopping physics and spin-orbit coupling, formalized through an effective ${l=1}$ angular momentum algebra for the $t_{2g}$ case. This equivalence allows one to transpose physical intuition and theoretical models developed for $p$-orbital systems directly onto the more complex $t_{2g}$ materials, and vice versa. We showcase how this paradigm provides a unified understanding of emergent phenomena, including non-trivial band topology, itinerant ferromagnetism, and unconventional superconductivity, across a wide range of platforms, from transition metal compounds, two-dimensional oxide heterostructures, and iron-based superconductors, to $p$-orbital ultracold gases. Ultimately, this $p$-$t_{2g}$ homology serves not only as a tool for interpretation but also as a robust design principle for engineering novel quantum states.

Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized nickelates has renewed interest in the broken-symmetry states of their ambient-pressure parent phases, where a density-wave (DW) order emerges and competes with superconductivity, but its microscopic origin remains unresolved. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we track quasiparticle relaxation dynamics across the DW transition at $T_{\rm DW} \approx$ 136 K in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals, revealing the opening of an energy gap of $\sim$ 52 meV. Multiple coherent phonons, including $A_g$ modes near 3.88, 5.28, and 2.09 THz, display pronounced mode-selective anomalies across the transition, demonstrating that the DW is coupled with lattice degree of freedom stabilized through electron-phonon coupling. At higher excitation densities, the DW is nonthermally suppressed, producing a temperature-fluence phase diagram that parallels pressure-tuned behavior. These results establish the DW in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ as a lattice-entangled instability involving multiple phonon modes, and highlight ultrafast optical excitation as a powerful tool to manipulate competing orders in nickelates.

Abstract: We present the combination of a complex-time tensor-network impurity solver with an analytic continuation scheme based on exponential fitting as an efficient framework for single and multi-orbital dynamical mean-field calculations. By performing time-evolution along a complex-time contour, the approach balances computational cost with the difficulty of spectral recovery, offering greater flexibility than methods confined to the real or imaginary axis. By complementing the complex-time evolution with an exponential fitting scheme, we faithfully extract real-time information at negligible cost. The resulting method obtains high-resolution spectra at a significantly lower computational cost than real-time evolution, offering a promising tool for ab initio studies of strongly correlated materials.

Motivation: To understand the detailed response of the Pomeranchuk effect to magnetic fields, which remains elusive in 3He due to its small nuclear magneton and lack of analogous fermion systems.

Method: The study demonstrates that an electron system exhibits the Pomeranchuk effect, where the Fermi liquid state solidifies in a high magnetic field, and a reentrant liquid state appears in ultrahigh fields. These responses are analyzed through changes in magnetic entropy and magnetization.

Result: The electron system shows the Pomeranchuk effect with a reentrant liquid state in ultrahigh fields, providing insights that extend to 3He.

Conclusion: The findings clarify the magnetic-field impact on the Pomeranchuk effect and open new possibilities for magnetic control of chemical interactions.

Abstract: The Pomeranchuk effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon where liquid helium-3 (3He) solidifies under specific pressures, not when cooled, but when heated. This behaviour originates from the magnetic entropy of nuclear spins, suggesting a magnetic field should influence it. However, its detailed response to magnetic fields remains elusive due to the small nuclear magneton of 3He and lack of analogous fermion systems. Here, we show that an electron system also exhibit the Pomeranchuk effect, where the Fermi liquid state solidifies in a high magnetic field, unlike conventional electron systems where a field melts an electron solid into a metal. Remarkably, the electron system displays a reentrant liquid state in ultrahigh fields. These responses are explained by changes in magnetic entropy and magnetisation, extending the underlying physics to 3He. Our findings clarify magnetic-field impact on the Pomeranchuk effect and open avenues for magnetic control of chemical interactions.

Conclusion: This work establishes a direct link between non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems.

Abstract: Characterizing universal entanglement features in higher-dimensional quantum matter is a central goal of quantum information science and condensed matter physics. While the subleading corner terms in two-dimensional quantum systems encapsulate essential universal information of the underlying conformal field theory, our understanding of these features remains remarkably limited compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. We address this challenge by investigating the entanglement dynamics of fermionic systems along the imaginary-time evolution. We uncover a pioneering non-equilibrium scaling law where the corner entanglement entropy grows linearly with the logarithm of imaginary time, dictated solely by the universality class of the quantum critical point. Through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we verify this scaling in the interacting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, demonstrating that universal data can be accurately recovered from the early stages of relaxation. Our findings significantly circumvent the computational bottlenecks inherent in reaching full equilibrium convergence. This work establishes a direct link between the fundamental theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties on both classical and quantum platforms, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems.

Abstract: At high-frequency a periodically-driven quantum spin-1/2 system can emulate a chiral spin liquid (CSL) described by an effective static local chiral hamiltonian. In contrast, at low-frequency {\it anomalous} CSL can be realized in Swap Models, in which one-way spin transport occurs at the edge although the bulk time-evolution operator over one period is trivial. In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap Models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We have used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the diamagnetic response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL. We also discuss the possible occurrence of a long-lived prethermal anomalous CSL.

Abstract: The experimental discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in tunable moiré superlattices has sparked intense interest in exploring the interplay between topological order and symmetry breaking phases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive numerical study of this interplay through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations on a minimal two-band lattice model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at filling $ν=-2/3$. We find robust FQAH ground states and provide clear numerical evidences for anyon excitations with fractional charge and pronounced real-space density modulations, directly supporting the recently proposed anyon density-wave halo picture. We also map out the displacement field dependent phase diagram, uncovering a rich landscape of charge ordered states emerging from the FQAH, including a quantum anomalous Hall crystal (QAHC) with an integer quantized Hall conductance. We expect our work to inspire further research interest of intertwined correlated topological phases in moiré systems.

TL;DR: The paper examines how distinct gapless quantum phases can be differentiated through their spatial interfaces, rather than edge modes, demonstrating that symmetry-preserving interfaces between differing 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) must become non-invertible defects, with applications to Ising CFTs and broader implications for higher-dimensional cases.

Motivation: 1

Method: 1

Result: 1

Conclusion: 1

Abstract: Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.

Abstract: Understanding the magnetic ground state of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates is crucial, as these materials exhibit superconductivity under high pressure and host competing electronic orders that may play a key role in the pairing mechanism. In this work, we investigate the magnetic properties of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$) using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($μ$SR) under both ambient and hydrostatic pressure conditions. The monolayer-trilayer phase develops incommensurate magnetic order below approximately 150 K, with a mean ordering temperature of $T_{SDW} \simeq 123$ K and a transition width of $ΔT_{SDW} \simeq 15$ K. The abrupt onset of the internal magnetic field indicates a first-order-like transition. Hydrostatic pressure ($p$) suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature at a rate of $dT_{SDW}/d p \simeq -3.9$ K/GPa, demonstrating a progressive destabilization of the ordered state. By comparison with the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ systems, and within a unified phenomenological framework, systematic trends are identified linking the pressure dependence of $T_{SDW}$, the (in)commensurability of the magnetic order, and the character of the magnetic transition. These trends consistently indicate a gradual reduction of electronic correlation strength from the bilayer to the monolayer-trilayer and trilayer nickelates. This hierarchy suggests that the higher superconducting transition temperature observed in the 2222 phase may be closely connected to its more strongly correlated electronic nature. These results position the alternating monolayer-trilayer 1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as an intermediate member linking the magnetic behavior of the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper compounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and systematically investigate a new class of kagome superconductors using CaPd5 as a prototype structure, aiming to uncover high-Tc superconductivity and topological properties.

Method: First-principles calculations and symmetry indicators were used to investigate the dynamical stability, electron-phonon coupling, and topological classification of CaMxPd5-x (M = Nb and V) alloys.

Result: Four dynamically stable compounds were identified: CaNb5 (Tc = 10.1 K, higher under pressure), CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3 (weaker EPC and lower Tc). CaNb5 was further classified topologically.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that Nb and V substitution in CaPd5 effectively designs new kagome superconductors with relatively high Tc, offering insights into topological superconductivity and guiding future discoveries.

Abstract: Materials featuring kagome lattices have attracted significant research interest due to their unique geometric frustration, which gives rise to rich physical phenomena such as non-trivial topology, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity. In this work, using CaPd5 as the prototype structure, we discover and systematically investigate a new class of kagome superconductors, CaMxPd5-x (M = Nb and V) alloys. First-principles calculations confirm that these compounds are non-magnetic metals, among which four are dynamically stable: CaNb5, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3. CaNb5 is identified as a strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) superconductor with the highest superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 10.1 K, which can be further increased to 12.8 K under external pressure. In contrast, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3 exhibit weaker EPC and correspondingly lower Tc values. Furthermore, by applying the method of symmetry indicators, we systematically classify the topological and nodal characteristics of CaNb5, providing valuable insights for determining its superconducting pairing symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that Nb and V substitution in kagome CaPd5 provides an effective route for designing a new type of kagome superconductor with relatively high Tc. This study also offers new perspectives on topological superconductivity in kagome systems and establishes a useful guideline for discovering other superconducting materials with unique properties.

Conclusion: 通过自旋敏感性分析和Knight位移测量研究自旋三重态超导体的序参量结构

Abstract: We analyze the spin susceptibility of spin-triplet superconductors from the zero-field to finite-field regimes, with emphasis on its implications for Knight-shift measurements. In the zero-field limit, we review the general expression for the static spin susceptibility and highlight the universal zero-temperature sum rule, $\sum_i χ_{ii}(T=0)=2χ^N$, which constrains the residual susceptibility components for any triplet state. Using representative isotropic, helical, and chiral $\vec{d}$-vectors, we illustrate how the Knight shift encodes the spin configuration of the order parameter and show that the sum rule remains robust even for anisotropic Fermi surfaces. We then incorporate magnetic field effects through a semiclassical Doppler shift of quasiparticle energies in the vortex state. The resulting field dependence of the susceptibility - including both longitudinal (Knight-shift) and transverse magnetic susceptibility components - provides a sensitive probe of nodal directions and the momentum dependence of the $\vec{d}$-vector. Applying this framework to UTe$_2$, we demonstrate how the distinct irreducible representations allowed by orthorhombic symmetry can be differentiated by their field-dependent susceptibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address discrepancies in earlier works that predicted the absence of spin injection at zero temperature and small spin voltages, and to explain experimental observations of spin injection in superconductors.

Method: The research demonstrates that nonequilibrium spin injection into a superconductor can generate an anomalous supercurrent or induce a phase gradient, even at spin voltages below the superconducting gap. The mechanism relies on nonequilibrium spin injection rather than breaking time-reversal symmetry.

Result: Superconductivity enhances spin injection due to the large quasiparticle density of states near the pairing gap, an effect that persists well below the gap. This contrasts with earlier predictions.

Conclusion: The study provides a natural explanation for long-standing experimental observations of spin injection in superconductors and predicts novel effects from spin-charge coupling, such as electrical control of anomalous phase gradients in systems with spin-orbit coupling. These findings are broadly applicable across various materials and hybrid superconducting structures.

Abstract: We show that nonequilibrium spin injection into a superconductor can generate an anomalous supercurrent or induce a phase gradient, even for spin voltages below the superconducting gap. Our mechanism does not require breaking time-reversal symmetry in the effective superconducting Hamiltonian, but instead relies on nonequilibrium spin injection. We further demonstrate that superconductivity enhances spin injection due to the large quasiparticle density of states near the pairing gap, an effect that persists well below the gap. This contrasts with earlier works predicting the absence of spin injection at zero temperature and small spin voltages.

Result: Tensile strain induces a Lifshitz transition, boosting pairing strength but increasing magnetic competition. Compressive strain selectively enhances Tc in the I4/mmm phase via Ni-O-Ni bond straightening and Γ-pocket formation.

Conclusion: The abstract analyzes how biaxial strain and structural symmetry affect superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 films, highlighting a balance between electronic and magnetic factors to optimize Tc.

Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient-pressure in strained thin films raises the question of how superconductivity can be optimized through strain. In this work, we investigate the strain-dependent electronic structure and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory combined with random phase approximation spin-fluctuation calculations. We find that biaxial strain acts as a tuning parameter for Fermi surface topology and magnetic correlations. Large tensile strain drives a Lifshitz transition characterized by a $d_{z^2}$ band crossing, leading to a sharp increase in the density of states and theoretical pairing strength. However, this is accompanied by a large increase in magnetic proximity, suggesting strong competition with spin-density-wave order. Conversely, under compressive strain, we identify a structurally selective $T_c$ enhancement restricted to the high-symmetry $I4/mmm$ phase. This effect is driven by the straightening of Ni--O--Ni bonds and the emergence of a $Γ$-centered hole pocket, yielding $T_c$ values consistent with recent thin-film experiments. Our results highlight the balance between structural symmetry, electronic topology, and magnetic instability in nickelates, and provides a theoretical framework for optimizing superconductivity via strain engineering.

Abstract: The transition to chaos for quantum dynamics is quantified via a finely tunable mixed random matrix ensemble. The {\it mixed Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (mGOE)} forms a pedagogically accessible family of systems in simulating {\it Many-Body Localization (MBL)} transitions. It can be tuned from chaotic to localized and heavy-tailed localized phases in a continuous fashion, providing an opportunity to explore new phases. We numerically study how the spectral properties of mGOE evolve during these transitions. Characterization of transition to quantum chaos is computed and analyzed via empirical spectral density, nearest-neighbor spacing, and adjacent gap ratios with statistical uncertainty quantifications that strengthens the robustness of evidence of transitions. The transition is identified as {\it Wigner Cat Phases}, because of the shape of empirical spectral densities, which depens on the tuneable parameter. These simulated phases in mGOE appear to be an ideal tool to study {\it Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)} and its related transitions, representing a family of physical systems under different localisation and disorder strengths.

Conclusion: 结果表明本研究为在测量方式为连续弱测量的平台中证明贝尔非定域性提供了一条实用途径

Abstract: Many solid-state quantum platforms do not permit sharp, projective measurements but instead yield continuous voltage or field traces under weak, non-demolition readout. In such systems, standard Bell tests based on dichotomic projective measurements are not directly applicable, raising the question of how quantum nonlocality can be certified from continuous time-series data. Here we develop a general theoretical framework showing that Bell-CHSH inequality violation can be extracted from continuous, non-projective measurements without assuming any specific collapse model or phase distribution. We show that sufficiently long continuous measurements of a single entangled pair sample its internal phase-probability structure, enabling effective dichotomic observables to be constructed through phase-sensitive projections and coarse-graining. The resulting Bell correlator is governed by two experimentally accessible resources: intrinsic single-qubit phase spread and nonlocal phase locking between qubits. We benchmark the resulting estimator against conventional projective-measurement CHSH tests implemented via quantum-circuit simulations using Qiskit, finding quantitative agreement in the Bell-violating regime without parameter fitting. Classical deterministic correlations cannot violate the CHSH bound, whereas quantum phase-locked systems recover the nonlinear angular dependence characteristic of entanglement. Our results provide a practical route to demonstrating Bell nonlocality in platforms where measurements are inherently continuous and weak.

TL;DR: A Stark-like potential applied to a cylindrical quantum system reveals hidden dimensions through energy level splitting, offering a low-energy detection method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a more feasible method for uncovering hidden extra dimensions in Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory, which traditionally requires high-energy conditions for detection.

Method: A perturbative potential inspired by the Stark effect, \(\hat{H}_{\text{SL}} = \beta zV_{o_{z}}(\theta)\), was applied to a quantum particle confined to a cylindrical surface (QPCS) with specific dimensions (length \(L\) and radius \(R_{o}\)).

Result: For a degenerate configuration (\(R_{o} = \frac{L}{\pi}\)), the Stark-like perturbation induces energy level splitting, with the first-order correction depending on quantum numbers \(n_{z}\) and \(n_{\theta}\).

Conclusion: The Stark-like perturbative potential induces energy level splitting in a QPCS, providing a feasible method to probe hidden extra-dimensional effects in lower-energy quantum systems.

Abstract: This study explores the influence of a Stark-like perturbative potential on a quantum particle confined to a cylindrical surface (QPCS) and its implications for extra-dimensional theories. The QPCS framework is particularly relevant to Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory, which postulates extra spatial dimensions to unify electromagnetism and gravity. In KK theory, these extra dimensions are typically hidden and require high-energy conditions for detection. Motivated by the challenge of uncovering these dimensions more feasibly, this research applies a perturbative potential of the form \hat{H}_{\text{SL}} = βzV_{o_{z}}(θ) to a QPCS characterized by length \textit{L} and radius R_{o}. This potential is inspired by the Stark effect in hydrogen atoms, where energy level splitting serves as an indicator of an external influence. The study demonstrates that, for a degenerate configuration (R_{o} = \frac{L}π), the Stark-like perturbation effectively induces energy level splitting, which can be interpreted as a means of revealing hidden dimensions. The first-order energy correction in this scenario depends explicitly on the quantum numbers n_{z} and n_θ, highlighting the potential for this approach to probe extra-dimensional effects in lower-energy quantum systems.

Conclusion: 通过分析，论文澄清了在开放量子系统中信息获取和测量反作用如何动态解耦，这对连续量子传感和非投影测量的基础研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Wavefunction collapse is often regarded as an unavoidable consequence of quantum measurement. Here we show that in driven-dissipative quantum systems, continuous measurement can extract information without disturbing the physical steady-state ensemble. Using the stochastic master equation formalism, we identify measurement-invariant steady states whose unconditional density matrix remains unchanged under continuous monitoring, despite the presence of measurement-induced collapse at the level of individual quantum trajectories. This separation between conditional collapse and ensemble invariance leads to a regime of partial collapse, in which measurement-induced localization is transient and continuously counteracted by dissipation and drive. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for steady-state invariance under continuous measurement and show-that it holds over a finite range of measurement strengths. Our results clarify how information gain and measurement backaction can be dynamically decoupled in open quantum systems, with implications for continuous quantum sensing and the foundations of nonprojective measurement.

Abstract: Quantum decoherence, the process by which a quantum system loses its coherence through interaction with an environment and becomes classical-like, represents both the fundamental mechanism for the quantum-to-classical transition and a major challenge to realizing scalable nanoscale quantum technologies. This work introduces a novel theoretical framework based on Quantum Phase Space (QPS) to address the dual challenge of characterizing environment-selected pointer states and modeling decoherence dynamics across different regimes. Within this framework, pointer states for particle motion are identified as the minimum-uncertainty states, those that saturate the quantum uncertainty relation, thereby constituting the closest quantum analogue to classical phase-space points. The structure of the QPS, encoded in a variance-covariance matrix, is shown to be directly shaped by environmental properties. A time-independent matrix corresponds to Markovian (memoryless) decoherence, described by constant diffusion and friction coefficients, while a time-dependent matrix captures non-Markovian dynamics, characterized by environmental memory and information backflow. This unified geometric formalism, applied to both Lindblad and Non-Markovian master equations, enables us to derive explicit relations between environmental parameters and phase-space structure, as demonstrated in a specific illustrative example. This approach has the potential to serve as a powerful tool for modeling decoherence in nanoscience and could inform new principles for designing mitigation strategies and harnessing non-Markovian effects for quantum technologies. The QPS framework may thus bridge fundamental theory and practical quantum engineering, offering a promising coherent pathway to understand, control, and exploit decoherence at the nanoscience frontier.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: explicit

Method: novel

Result: significant

Conclusion: strong

Abstract: We present a time-symmetric variational formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in which Schrödinger dynamics and a Bohm-type guidance law arise as emergent Euler-Lagrange optimality conditions rather than postulates. The formulation is expressed in terms of probability density and current fields subject to a continuity constraint and two-time boundary conditions. A Fisher-information regularization term generates the quantum potential, yielding the Schrödinger equation when the optimality system is expressed in complex form. Unlike standard Bohmian mechanics, which requires an auxiliary Quantum Equilibrium Hypothesis ($P = |ψ|^2$), our primal-dual formulation satisfies the Born rule by construction. The trajectories emerge not from an external guidance wave, but as the unique hydrodynamic flow minimizing the Fisher-regularized action between two-time boundary constraints. Deterministic trajectories thus emerge only as effective, coarse-grained descriptions, with randomness entering objectively at the interface of boundary constraints.

Abstract: A theoretical analysis of the Casimir interaction between an arc and plate is conducted, which remains unexplored despite its relevance to Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication. The configuration consists of a rigid finite plate and a flexible curved nanomembrane, with radius 100 micrometers, initially concave toward the rigid plate. The maximum thickness is evaluated for which the nanomembrane undergoes a change in curvature: from concave to convex with respect to the plate, due to the Casimir interaction. The Casimir energy for a curved surface is derived using the Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) with next-to-leading-order (NTLO) corrections. Kirchhoff-Love theory for a thin isotropic plate of constant thickness is used to estimate the bending energy. Material-dependent effects on the Casimir interaction are evaluated by comparing Au and Ag plates. The maximum thickness is derived where U_Casimir > U_bending for distances in the range of 0.1-1 micrometers. Results show curvature reversal occurs for nanomembranes with nanoscale thicknesses at the studied distances. Silver nanomembranes tolerate greater thickness than gold nanomembranes due to material-dependent properties. Comparison between NTLO-corrected PFA and perturbative PFA confirms the accuracy of the NTLO approach. The Casimir arc-to-plate geometry in MEMS enables Casimir-based actuation, enhances devices reliability, and prevents stiction. These findings provide thickness constraints for MEMS design and performance, accounting for the Casimir force.

The Lieb--Robinson correlation function can be used to characterize the propagation of quantum information in Ising chains. Considerable work has been done to establish bounds on this correlation function in various circumstances. To actually calculate the value of the correlation function directly typically requires a state space which grows exponentially with system size, and so is intractable for all but relatively small systems. We employ a recently-developed method that enables direct calculation of the value of the Lieb--Robinson correlation function and which scales linearly with system size. This enables the computation for systems with many hundreds of qubits, revealing the propagation of quantum information down the chain. We extend this technique to the problem of Ising chains with randomly disordered coupling strengths. Increasing disorder causes localization of the quantum correlations and halts propagation of quantum information.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum-circuit workflow (qGAN-QAOA) is proposed to solve two-stage stochastic programming problems efficiently by combining qGAN for scenario encoding and QAOA for optimization, demonstrating superior performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the scalability issue of scenario enumeration in two-stage stochastic programming by using quantum computing to achieve polylogarithmic scaling of gate count and circuit depth with the number of scenarios.

Method: The method combines a pre-trained quantum generative adversarial network (qGAN) to encode scenario distributions and QAOA to optimize first-stage decisions by minimizing the full two-stage objective, including expected recourse cost.

Result: Numerical experiments on the stochastic unit commitment problem with photovoltaic uncertainty show the qGAN-QAOA method compares favorably with classical expected-value and two-stage stochastic programming baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed qGAN-QAOA method demonstrates effectiveness in solving two-stage stochastic programming problems, particularly in scenarios like stochastic unit commitment with photovoltaic uncertainty, by leveraging quantum computing capabilities.

Abstract: Two-stage stochastic programming often discretizes uncertainty into scenarios, but scenario enumeration makes expected recourse evaluation scale at least linearly in the scenario count. We propose qGAN-QAOA, a unified quantum-circuit workflow in which a pre-trained quantum generative adversarial network encodes the scenario distribution and QAOA optimizes first-stage decisions by minimizing the full two-stage objective, including expected recourse cost. With the qGAN parameters fixed after training, we evaluate the objective as the expectation value of a problem Hamiltonian and optimize only the QAOA variational parameters. We interpret non-anticipativity as a condition on measurement outcome statistics and prove that the first-stage measurement marginal is independent of the scenario. For uniformly discretized uncertainty, the diagonal operator encoding the uncertainty admits a sparse Pauli-Z expansion via the Walsh--Hadamard transform, yielding polylogarithmic scaling of gate count and circuit depth with the number of scenarios. Numerical experiments on the stochastic unit commitment problem (UCP) with photovoltaic (PV) uncertainty compare the expected cost of the proposed method with classical expected-value and two-stage stochastic programming baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of qGAN-QAOA as a two-stage decision model.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the quantization of branched Hamiltonians in the modified Emden equation, showing a quasi-harmonic spectrum with non-uniform spacing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the quantization of branched Hamiltonians in the modified Emden equation, beyond its classical isochronicity and previously discussed polynomial solutions.

Method: The study employs canonical quantization and perturbation theory to analyze the spectrum of the modified Emden equation, supplemented by numerical validation.

Result: For small k, the energy spectrum is quasi-harmonic with deviations from uniform spacing, confirmed numerically and analytically.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the quantization of branched Hamiltonians in the modified Emden equation results in a quasi-harmonic spectrum with deviations from uniform spacing, validated by analytical and numerical methods.

Abstract: We revisit the canonical quantization to assess the spectrum of the modified Emden equation $\ddot{x} + kx\dot{x} + ω^2 x + \frac{k^2}{9}x^3 = 0$, which is an isochronous case of the Liénard-Kukles equation. While its classical isochronicity and canonical quantization, leading to polynomial solutions with an exactly-equispaced spectrum have been discussed earlier, including in the recent paper [Int. J. Theor. Phys. 64, 212 (2025)], the present study focuses on the quantization of its branched Hamiltonians. For small $k$, we show numerically that the resulting energy spectrum is no longer perfectly harmonic but only approximately equispaced, exhibiting quasi-harmonic behavior characterized by deviations from uniform spacing. Our numerical results are precisely validated by analytical calculations based on perturbation theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve efficient low-current flux modulation of superconducting resonators and enable sensitive measurement of flux signals.

Method: Utilized aluminum-based quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators terminated with SQUIDs, employed asymmetric junctions to mitigate branch switching, and compared flip-chip and on-chip input-coil-based modulation techniques.

Result: Achieved flux modulation of over 1 GHz and flux responsivities up to tens of GHz/Φ0 with μA-scale currents, with flux-transfer efficiencies up to 20%.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates efficient flux modulation of superconducting resonators using SQUIDs with asymmetric junctions and either flip-chip or on-chip input coils, achieving high flux responsivities and paving the way for sensitive flux signal measurements.

Abstract: We demonstrate the efficient modulation of flux-tunable superconducting resonators (FTRs) using flip-chip or on-chip-based input coils. The FTRs we use are aluminum-based quarter-wave coplanar waveguide resonators terminated with 100um or 200um-wide square loop dc superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) employing 1um-sized Josephson junctions. We employ SQUIDs with a geometric loop inductance of up to 0.7nH to increase the flux transfer efficiency. The geometric inductance of the SQUID results in a non-zero screening parameter $β_L$, whose branch switching effect is mitigated by using asymmetric junctions. We achieve flux modulation of the FTRs by more than one GHz and flux responsivities of up to tens of GHz/$Φ_0$ with uA-scale on-chip currents. We compare flip-chip with on-chip input-coil-based flux modulation, where the former is realized through galvanically connected and closely spaced chips, while the latter is achieved through superconducting air-bridge connections. We achieve a flux-transfer efficiency from the input coil to the SQUID loop of up to 20%. Our work paves the way for efficient low current flux modulation of FTRs and sensitive measurement of flux signals.

Conclusion: The techniques developed enable detailed characterization of noise environments in semiconductor devices, offering critical insights for optimizing fabrication processes, defect control, and advancing quantum technologies.

Abstract: The nanoscale charge environment critically influences semiconductor physics and device performance. While conventional bulk characterization techniques provide volume-averaged defect properties, they lack the spatial resolution to resolve nanoscale charge heterogeneity and identify microscopic noise sources. Here, we utilize single PL5 centers in 4H-SiC as room-temperature broadband quantum sensors to fill in the gap. We report the first real-time, nanoscale observation of singlecharge tunneling dynamics in a commercial semiconductor at room temperature, by monitoring the random telegraph noise using optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). This capability enables an electrical noise imaging technique, showing distinct noise variations across different wafer substrates. By employing dynamical decoupling, we extend noise spectroscopy from near-DC to MHz frequencies, uncovering significant noise spectral density correlations across frequency bands. Finally, we probe MHz-GHz noise and identify its origin via T1 relaxation spectroscopy, obtaining the first nanoscale electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic fingerprint of charge defects in SiC. These techniques open avenues for characterizing noise environments in semiconductor devices, providing critical insights for optimizing SiC fabrication processes, defect control, and advancing quantum technologies.

TL;DR: The paper shows that quantum entanglement can persist at ambient temperature and macroscopic distances under specific conditions, using collective quantum modes and open-system dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the common assumption that quantum entanglement is fragile at ambient temperature and over macroscopic distances by investigating collective quantum modes governed by reduced open-system channels.

Method: The authors derived an exact entanglement boundary based on the positivity of the partial transpose, performed stochastic simulations of the reduced open-system dynamics, and compared quantum and classical correlated-noise models.

Result: The study reveals that large collective occupation suppresses but does not eliminate quantum phase diffusion, sustaining steady-state entanglement at finite temperature, with entanglement witnesses violated only in the quantum regime.

Conclusion: The study establishes a minimal, platform-independent framework connecting collective-mode dynamics, noise injection, distance, and operational certification of macroscopic entanglement, demonstrating the robustness of entanglement under specific conditions.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is commonly assumed to be fragile at ambient temperature and over macroscopic distances, where thermal noise and dissipation are expected to rapidly suppress nonclassical correlations. Here we show that this intuition fails for collective quantum modes whose dynamics is governed by reduced open-system channels rather than by microscopic thermal equilibrium. For two spatially separated collective modes, we derive an exact entanglement boundary based on the positivity of the partial transpose, valid in the symmetric resonant limit. From this result we obtain an explicit minimum collective fluctuation amplitude, expressed entirely in measurable noise, bandwidth, dissipation, and distance-dependent coupling parameters, required to sustain steady-state entanglement at finite temperature. We further show that large collective occupation suppresses but does not eliminate quantum phase diffusion, so the steady state remains phase symmetric and does not collapse to a classical mean-field despite macroscopic signal amplitudes. Stochastic simulations of the reduced open-system dynamics, together with matched classical correlated-noise null models analyzed through an identical pipeline, confirm that entanglement witnesses are violated only in the quantum regime. Our results establish a minimal, platform-independent framework connecting collective-mode dynamics, noise injection, distance, and operational certification of macroscopic entanglement.

TL;DR: Mixed noise, especially with high-frequency components, can protect entanglement in quantum systems by countering decoherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conventional view that noise is purely detrimental by showing that mixed noise can protect entanglement in quantum systems.

Method: Analytical derivation of dynamical equations and numerical simulations with various noise types (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, flicker noise, telegraph noise).

Result: High-frequency noise in atom-cavity couplings suppresses decoherence from cavity leakage, protecting entanglement, with effectiveness depending on the proportion of high-frequency components.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that enhanced high-frequency components in mixed noise are essential for effective noise-assisted entanglement protection, providing key insights for noise engineering in quantum systems.

Abstract: Contrary to the conventional view that noise is detrimental, we show that mixed noise can protect entanglement in a two-atom-cavity system. Specifically, the leakage of the cavity and the stochastic atom-cavity couplings are modeled as two types of noises. From the analytical derivation of the dynamical equations, the mechanism of the entanglement protection is revealed as the high-frequency(HF) noise in the atom-cavity couplings could suppress the decoherence caused by the cavity leakage, thus protect the entanglement. We investigate the entanglement protection induced by mixed noise constructed from diverse noise types, including the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, flicker noise, and telegraph noise. Numerical simulations demonstrate that entanglement protection depends critically on the proportion of HF components in the power spectral density of the mixed noise. Our work establishes that enhanced HF components are essential for effective noise-assisted entanglement protection, offering key insights for noise engineering in practical open quantum systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore fault-tolerant properties of self-dual fracton codes, focusing on checkerboard code's optimal thresholds

Method: Statistical-mechanical mapping and parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations

Result: Checkerboard code capacity is ~0.108(2), highest among 3D codes, near theoretical limit; Haah's code likely similar

Conclusion: Fracton codes exhibit high fault-tolerance with thresholds near theoretical limits, validated by dual entropy relations and numerical simulations.

Abstract: Fracton codes have been intensively studied as novel topological states of matter, yet their fault-tolerant properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the optimal thresholds of self-dual fracton codes, in particular the checkerboard code, against stochastic Pauli noise. By utilizing a statistical-mechanical mapping combined with large-scale parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate the optimal code capacity of the checkerboard code to be $p_{th} \simeq 0.108(2)$. This value is the highest among known three-dimensional codes and nearly saturates the theoretical limit for topological codes. Our results further validate the generalized entropy relation for two mutually dual models, $H(p_{th}) + H(\tilde{p}_{th}) \approx 1$, and extend its applicability beyond standard topological codes. This verification indicates the Haah's code also possesses a code capacity near the theoretical limit $p_{th} \approx 0.11$. These findings highlight fracton codes as highly resilient quantum memory and demonstrate the utility of duality techniques in analyzing intricate quantum error-correcting codes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quantum internet is a rapidly developing field, but the emergent network structures are unclear. The study aims to explore how flexible, secure indirect quantum communication influences network architecture.

Method: The authors propose a quantum preferential attachment model where new nodes connect uniformly randomly to any node within the proximity of the target, rather than directly to the target. Numerical and analytic methods are used to analyze the resulting network structures.

Result: The model reveals two distinct classes of small-world network architectures that are not scale-free. Numerical results are supported by rigorous analytic findings, unifying quantum and classical preferential attachment in a single phase diagram.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum preferential attachment model qualitatively changes global network behavior, leading to two distinct small-world network architectures that are not scale-free. The framework unifies quantum and classical variants of preferential attachment.

Abstract: The quantum internet is a rapidly developing technological reality, yet, it remains unclear what kind of quantum network structures might emerge. Since indirect quantum communication is already feasible and preserves absolute security of the communication channel, a new node joining the quantum network does not need to connect directly to its desired target. Instead, in our proposed quantum preferential attachment model, it uniformly randomly connects to any node within the proximity of the target, including, but not restricted to, the target itself. This local flexibility is found to qualitatively change the global network behavior, leading to two distinct classes of complex network architectures, both of which are small-world, but neither of which is scale-free. Our numerical findings are supported by rigorous analytic results, in a framework that incorporates quantum and classical variants of preferential attachment in a unified phase diagram. Besides quantum networks, we expect that our results will have broad implications for classical scenarios where there is flexibility in establishing new connections.

Motivation: The paper aims to understand the average bipartite entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems with global SU(2) symmetry, specifically constrained to fixed total spin J and magnetization J_z = 0.

It derives an asymptotic expression for the average entanglement entropy up to constant order in the system volume V, incorporating the scaling of Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and angular-momentum coupling within magnetization blocks.

Result: The study reveals an asymptotic expression for the average entanglement entropy, including a leading volume law term, a 1/2 log V finite-size correction, and an O(1) contribution from angular-momentum coupling. This provides a comprehensive understanding of how SU(2) symmetry shapes entanglement in such systems.

Conclusion: The study extends Page-type results to non-Abelian sectors by analyzing Haar-random pure states in quantum many-body systems with global SU(2) symmetry. It provides a fully analytical treatment for arbitrary spin densities and clarifies how SU(2) symmetry influences average entanglement entropy.

Abstract: We study the average bipartite entanglement entropy of Haar-random pure states in quantum many-body systems with global $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry, constrained to fixed total spin $J$ and magnetization $J_z = 0$. Focusing on spin-$\tfrac12$ lattices and subsystem fractions $f < \frac{1}{2}$, we derive a asymptotic expression for the average entanglement entropy up to constant order in the system volume $V$. In addition to the expected leading volume law term, we prove the existence of a $\frac{1}{2}\log V$ finite-size correction resulting from the scaling of the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and compute explicitly the $O(1)$ contribution reflecting angular-momentum coupling within magnetization blocks. Our analysis uses features of random matrix ensembles and provides a fully analytical treatment for arbitrary spin densities, thereby extending Page type results to non-Abelian sectors and clarifying how $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry shapes average entanglement.

Motivation: To address the challenge of precise phase estimation in quantum metrology, particularly under the influence of phase-diffusive noise, by employing joint estimation of phase and phase diffusion.

Method: The work uses deterministic Bell measurements on a two-qubit system and a linear optical network to implement parameter encoding and measurements.

Result: Improved estimation precision is achieved compared to separable measurement strategies, validating the effectiveness of collective measurements.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the advantages of collective measurements in multi-parameter quantum metrology, providing a new framework for phase estimation under phase-diffusive noise.

Abstract: Accurate phase estimation plays a pivotal role in quantum metrology, yet its precision is significantly affected by noise, particularly phase-diffusive noise caused by phase drift. To address this challenge, the joint estimation of phase and phase diffusion has emerged as an effective approach, transforming the problem into a multi-parameter estimation task. However, the incompatibility between optimal measurements for different parameters prevents single-copy measurements from reaching the fundamental precision limits defined by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. Meanwhile, collective measurements performed on multiple identical copies can mitigate this incompatibility and thus enhance the precision of joint parameter estimation. This work experimentally demonstrates joint phase and phase-diffusion estimation using deterministic Bell measurements on a two-qubit system. A linear optical network is employed to implement both parameter encoding and deterministic Bell measurements, achieving improved estimation precision compared to any separable measurement strategy. This work proposes a new framework for phase estimation under phase-diffusive noise and underscores the substantial advantages of collective measurements in multi-parameter quantum metrology.

Motivation: Despite the potential of quantum computing in accelerating fluid dynamics simulations, hardware noise in the current quantum era distorts accuracy. The specific physical effects of quantum noise on flow simulations remain poorly understood.

Method: The research employs a quantum spectral algorithm to isolate and analyze noise-induced artifacts in spectral magnitudes. It derives a theoretical transition matrix based on Hamming distances and validates the model using density-matrix simulations and experiments on a superconducting quantum processor.

Result: The study identifies that quantum noise primarily manifests as artificial diffusion and nonlinear source terms in the effective partial differential equation, providing a deterministic model for quantum errors.

Conclusion: The study suggests that quantum errors in fluid dynamics simulations can be modeled as deterministic physical terms, such as artificial diffusion and nonlinear source terms, rather than purely stochastic perturbations.

Abstract: Quantum computing holds potential for accelerating the simulation of fluid dynamics. However, hardware noise in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era significantly distorts simulation accuracy. Although error magnitudes are frequently quantified, the specific physical effects of quantum noise on flow simulation results remain largely uncharacterized. We investigate the influence of gate noise on the quantum simulation of one-dimensional scalar convection. By employing a quantum spectral algorithm where ideal time advancement affects only Fourier phases, we isolate and analyze noise-induced artifacts in spectral magnitudes. We derive a theoretical transition matrix based on Hamming distances between computational basis states to predict spectral decay, and then validate this model against density-matrix simulations and experiments on a superconducting quantum processor. Furthermore, using data-driven sparse regression, we demonstrate that quantum noise manifests in the effective partial differential equation primarily as artificial diffusion and nonlinear source terms. These findings suggest that quantum errors can be modeled as deterministic physical terms rather than purely stochastic perturbations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and quantify the asymmetry effects from imbalance and quantum efficiency variations in photodetectors on measurement outcomes and their implications for quantum key distribution.

Method: Utilized Gaussian approximation to analyze photocount statistics, computed Q symbols of POVMs for noisy measurements, derived operator representations, and performed asymptotic security analysis for CV-QKD protocols.

Result: Found that asymmetry effects degrade the performance of CV-QKD by affecting mutual information, Holevo information, and asymptotic secret fraction, with double homodyne POVM representations requiring optimization due to squeezing dependence.

Conclusion: The study highlights the impact of asymmetry effects in homodyne and double homodyne measurements on the performance of CV-QKD protocols, emphasizing the need for optimization due to squeezing-dependent Holevo information and degraded security metrics.

Abstract: We use the Gaussian approximation describing photocount statistics for both the homodyne and the double homodyne (heterodyne) measurements to study asymmetry effects arising from imbalance of the beam splitters and variations in quantum efficiencies of the photodetectors. After computing the $Q$ symbols of the positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) of noisy measurements that take into account the asymmetry effects, the operator representations for the POVMs are obtained in the form that assumes applying the additive noise quantum channel to the POVMs of noiseless (ideal) measurements. For double homodyne detection, it was found that the noiseless measurements should generally be expressed in terms of the projectors onto squeezed-states and the corresponding squeezed-state operator representation of POVM along with the measurement noise channel depend on the squeezing parameter that lies in the interval dictated by the condition for the excess noise covariance matrix to be positive semi-definite. The analytical results are used to perform analysis of the asymptotic security of the Gaussian-modulated continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocol in the untrusted-noise scenario where the measurement noise is assumed to be accessible to an adversary. The inherent non-uniqueness of the operator representation for the double-homodyne POVM manifests itself in the squeezing dependent Holevo information that needs to be additionally optimized. For both types of the measurements, the mutual information, the Holevo information and the asymptotic secret fraction are sensitive to asymmetry effects leading to degraded performance of the protocol.

Abstract: We present 1d-qt-ideal-solver, an open-source Python library for simulating one-dimensional quantum tunneling dynamics under idealized coherent conditions. The solver implements the split-operator method with second-order Trotter-Suzuki factorization, utilizing FFT-based spectral differentiation for the kinetic operator and complex absorbing potentials to eliminate boundary reflections. Numba just-in-time compilation achieves performance comparable to compiled languages while maintaining code accessibility. We validate the implementation through two canonical test cases: rectangular barriers modeling field emission through oxide layers and Gaussian barriers approximating scanning tunneling microscopy interactions. Both simulations achieve exceptional numerical fidelity with machine-precision energy conservation over femtosecond-scale propagation. Comparative analysis employing information-theoretic measures and nonparametric hypothesis tests reveals that rectangular barriers exhibit moderately higher transmission coefficients than Gaussian barriers in the over-barrier regime, though Jensen-Shannon divergence analysis indicates modest practical differences between geometries. Phase space analysis confirms complete decoherence when averaged over spatial-temporal domains. The library name reflects its scope: idealized signifies deliberate exclusion of dissipation, environmental coupling, and many-body interactions, limiting applicability to qualitative insights and pedagogical purposes rather than quantitative experimental predictions. Distributed under the MIT License, the library provides a deployable tool for teaching quantum mechanics and preliminary exploration of tunneling dynamics.

Abstract: Trotter errors in digitized quantum dynamics arise from approximating time-ordered evolution under noncommuting Hamiltonian terms with a product formula. In the adiabatic regime, such errors are known to exhibit long-time self-healing [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{131}, 060602 (2023)], where discretization effects are effectively suppressed. Here we show that self-healing persists at finite evolution times once nonadiabatic errors induced by finite-speed ramps are compensated. Using counterdiabatic driving to cancel diabatic transitions and isolate discretization effects, we study both noninteracting and interacting spin models and characterize the finite-time scaling with the Trotter steps and the total evolution time. In the instantaneous eigenbasis of the driven Hamiltonian, the leading digital error maps to an effective harmonic perturbation whose dominant Fourier component yields an analytic upper bound on the finite-time Trotter error and reveals the phase-cancellation mechanism underlying self-healing. Our results establish finite-time self-healing as a generic feature of digitized counterdiabatic protocols, clarify its mechanism beyond the long-time adiabatic limit, and provide practical guidance for high-fidelity state preparation on gate-based quantum processors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Given the computational challenges in solving Helmholtz problems on classical computers, especially with high-order finite elements, the authors explore quantum algorithms as a potential solution. The method aims to reduce complexity and improve efficiency.

Method: The authors propose using variational quantum algorithms to tackle the linear systems from finite element discretization of Helmholtz equations. They achieve this by designing a block encoding for the operators derived from the discretization, enabling a quantum circuit implementation with depth scaling log-polynomially with the problem size.

Result: The abstract reports successful application of the quantum algorithm to a one-dimensional Helmholtz problem, validating its effectiveness for various wavenumbers and boundary conditions. The quantum circuit depth is shown to scale favorably with problem parameters.

Conclusion: The abstract presents a quantum computing approach to solving discretized Helmholtz problems, which are traditionally challenging for classical computation. It outlines a method for designing a quantum circuit of logarithmic depth and demonstrates the algorithm's application on a one-dimensional Helmholtz problem under different boundary conditions and wavenumbers.

Abstract: Discretizing Helmholtz problems via finite elements yields linear systems whose efficient solution remains a major challenge for classical computation. In this paper, we investigate how variational quantum algorithms could address this challenge. We first show that, for regular meshes, a block encoding of the operators $A$ and $A^\dagger A$ arising from the high-order finite element discretisation of Helmholtz problems can be designed, resulting in a quantum circuit of depth $\mathcal{O}(p^3\mathrm{poly}\log(Np))$ with $N$ the number of elements and $p$ the order of the finite elements. Then we apply our algorithm to a one-dimensional Helmholtz problem with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions for various wavenumbers.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a minimal fitting procedure that improves parameter estimation in spin relaxometry by addressing artifacts from imperfect spin polarization, offering more accurate fits and a framework for parallelizing single-spin dynamics studies.

Abstract: Spin relaxometry based on quantum spin systems has developed as a valuable tool in medical and condensed matter systems, offering the advantage of operating without the need for external DC or RF fields. Spin relaxometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers has been applied to paramagnetic sensing using both single crystal diamond and nanodiamond materials. However, these methods often suffer from artifacts and systematic uncertainties, particularly due to imperfect spin state preparation, leading to artificially fast T$_1$ relaxation times. Current analysis techniques fail to adequately account for these issues, limiting the precision of parameter estimation. In this work, we introduce a minimal fitting procedure that enables more robust parameter estimation in the presence of imperfect spin polarization. Our model improves upon existing approaches by offering more accurate fits and provides a framework for efficiently parallelizing single-spin dynamics studies.

*Daniel C. Cole,Vikas Buchemmavari,Mark Saffman*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A modified Rydberg gate protocol with detuning and robust control achieves high fidelity close to fundamental limits and adapts to varied conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-fidelity Rydberg gate operation without relying on strong Rydberg interactions, addressing limitations of the original protocol.

Method: The authors modify the original $π-2π-π$ protocol by adding a detuning to the $2π$ pulse on the target qubit. They generalize the protocol for arbitrary controlled phases and design optimal target-qubit phase waveforms. Robust control methods are applied to ensure the gate's resilience to variations in Rabi frequency and interaction strength.

Result: The protocol achieves fidelity within 2.39 (1.68) times the fundamental limit for equal (asymmetric) Rabi frequencies. The constant-phase protocol is found to be time-optimal, and robust control methods enhance stability.

Conclusion: The modified Rydberg gate protocol, with an additional detuning and optimal phase waveforms, achieves high fidelity close to the fundamental limit. The constant-phase protocol is identified as time-optimal under fixed conditions, and robust control methods enhance reliability against parameter variations.

Abstract: We analyze a new Rydberg gate design based on the original $π-2π-π$ protocol [Jaksch, et. al. Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 2208 (2000)] that is modified to enable high fidelity operation without requiring a strong Rydberg interaction. The gate retains the $π-2π-π$ structure with an additional detuning added to the $2π$ pulse on the target qubit. The protocol reaches within a factor of 2.39 (1.68) of the fundamental fidelity limit set by Rydberg lifetime for equal (asymmetric) Rabi frequencies on the control and target qubits. We generalize the gate protocol to arbitrary controlled phases. We design optimal target-qubit phase waveforms to generalize the gate across a range of interaction strengths and we find that, within this family of gates, the constant-phase protocol is time-optimal for a fixed laser Rabi frequency and tunable interaction strength. Robust control methods are used to design gates that are robust against variations in Rydberg Rabi frequency or interaction strength.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To probe the dynamics of the Standard Model and its gauge theories through quantum simulations of many-body systems.

Method: Developed a mapping of continuous gauge fields to qubit-based representations and two distinct algorithms for time evolution in the mixed basis.

Result: Three qubits per plaquette achieve per-mille precision; quantum results match classical predictions at percent-level accuracy on IBM's Heron processor.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the viability of mixed-basis formulations for simulating SU(2) gauge theories, providing a path for larger system simulations in two and three dimensions.

Abstract: Quantum simulations of many-body systems offer novel methods for probing the dynamics of the Standard Model and its constituent gauge theories. Extracting low-energy predictions from such simulations rely on formulating systematically-improvable representations of lattice gauge theory Hamiltonians that are efficient at all values of the gauge coupling. One such candidate representation for SU(2) is the fully gauge-fixed Hamiltonian defined in the mixed basis. This work focuses on the quantum simulation of the smallest non-trivial system: two plaquettes with open boundary conditions. A mapping of the continuous gauge field degrees of freedom to qubit-based representations is developed. It is found that as few as three qubits per plaquette is sufficient to reach per-mille level precision on predictions for observables. Two distinct algorithms for implementing time evolution in the mixed basis are developed and analyzed in terms of quantum resource estimates. One algorithm has favorable scaling in circuit depth for large numbers of qubits, while the other is more practical when qubit count is limited. The latter algorithm is used in the measurement of a real-time observable on IBM's Heron superconducting quantum processor, ibm_fez. The quantum results match classical predictions at the percent-level. This work lays out a path forward for two- and three-dimensional simulations of larger systems, as well as demonstrating the viability of mixed-basis formulations for studying the properties of SU(2) gauge theories at all values of the gauge coupling.

TL;DR: NV-QWOA outperforms Lie-algebraic pretraining in QAOA for Maxcut, achieving near-optimal solutions with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random initialization in QAOA leads to vanishing gradients, making variational optimization ineffective. This study explores alternative strategies to improve trainability.

Method: Comparative analysis of Lie-algebraic pretraining and NV-QWOA on unweighted Maxcut problems with 200 Erdős-Rényi and 200 3-regular graphs (16 vertices).

Result: NV-QWOA achieves a mean approximation ratio of 98.9% in 60 iterations, while Lie-algebraic pretrained QAOA reaches 77.71% after 500 iterations.

Conclusion: The structured parameterization of NV-QWOA offers a more robust training approach than Lie-algebraic pretraining, achieving high approximation ratios with fewer parameters. Future work should explore scaling and generalization.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading candidate for achieving quantum advantage in combinatorial optimization on Near-Term Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. However, random initialization of the variational parameters typically leads to vanishing gradients, rendering standard variational optimization ineffective. This paper provides a comparative performance analysis of two distinct strategies designed to improve trainability: Lie algebraic pretraining framework that uses Lie-algebraic classical simulation to find near-optimal initializations, and non-variational QWOA (NV-QWOA) that targets a restrict parameter subspace covered by 3 hyperparameters. We benchmark both methods on the unweighted Maxcut problem using a circuit depth of $p = 256$ across 200 Erdős-Rényi and 200 3-regular graphs, each with 16 vertices. Both approaches significantly improve upon the standard randomly initialized QWOA. NV-QWOA attains a mean approximation ratio of 98.9\% in just 60 iterations, while the Lie-algebraic pretrained QWOA improves to 77.71\% after 500 iterations. That optimization proceeds more quickly for NV-QWOA is not surprising given its significantly smaller parameter space, however, that an algorithm with so few tunable parameters reliably finds near-optimal solutions is remarkable. These findings suggest that the structured parameterization of NV-QWOA offers a more robust training approach than pretraining on lower-dimensional auxiliary problems. Future work is needed to confirm scaling to larger problem sizes and to asses generalization to other problem classes.

By constructing a counterexample in 2-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we disprove this conjecture.

*Roey Shafran,Ron Ziv,Mordechai Segev*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new method simplifies the measurement of high-dimensional hyperentangled states by encoding multi-DOF quantum information into the spatial DOF, reducing setup complexity and acquisition time compared to traditional QST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional and hyperentangled states are promising for improving quantum technologies, but their measurement is challenging due to the complexity and time required for quantum state tomography (QST).

Method: The method leverages the spatial degree of freedom (DOF) of a photon to encode information from other DOFs, using a single intensity-measurement from traditional cameras. It is demonstrated numerically for single-photon OAM-spin and OAM-frequency entangled states.

Result: The framework successfully reconstructs the density matrix of hyperentangled states with fewer measurements and simpler setups, avoiding the need for projection measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed framework simplifies the experimental setup and reduces acquisition time for measuring high-dimensional and hyperentangled states, while enabling the recovery of DOFs that conventional cameras cannot detect.

Abstract: Photonic quantum technologies utilize various degrees of freedom (DOFs) of light, such as polarization, frequency, and spatial modes, to encode quantum information. In the effort of further improving channel capacity and increasing the complexity of available quantum operations, high-dimensional and hyperentangled states are now gaining interest. Efficiently measuring these high dimensional states is challenging due to the large number of measurements required for reconstructing the full density matrix via quantum state tomography (QST), and the fact that each measurement requires some modification in the experimental setup. Here, we propose a framework for reconstructing the density matrix of a single-photon hyperentangled across multiple DOFs using a single intensity-measurement obtainable from traditional cameras, and discuss extensions for multiphoton hyperentangled states. Our method hinges on the spatial DOF of the photon and uses it to encode information from other DOFs. We numerically demonstrate this method for single-photon OAM-spin and OAM-frequency entangled states using an ideal coupler and a multimode fiber, to perform the spatial information mixing and encoding. This technique simplifies the experimental setup and reduces acquisition time compared to traditional QST based methods. Moreover, it allows recovery of DOFs that conventional cameras cannot detect, such as polarization, thus eliminating the need for projection measurements.

TL;DR: The paper redefines observers in quantum theory via operational eternalism, addressing tensions between causality and agency from an informational perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unbridgeable tension between operational quantum theory and dynamical spacetime physics if both are considered fundamental, by proposing a new perspective on causality and agency.

Method: The method involves analyzing the tension between operational quantum theory and dynamical spacetime physics through the lens of operational eternalism, focusing on information rather than geometry.

Result: Results show that agency is perspectival, with inputs and outputs as primary givens and agents as secondary constructs. This redefines the observer in the operational approach.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the observer in the operational approach is redefined as a tool to avoid non-causality, and provides a criterion for causally compatible agents like Wigner's friends.

Abstract: After two decades of research on indefinite causality, a philosophical lesson emerges: the tension between operational quantum theory and dynamical spacetime physics is unbridgeable if one believes both types of theories to be fundamental. We interpret this tension through operational eternalism, a stance analogous to the block-universe view but applied to information rather than geometry. Inputs and outputs are primary givens, while agents are secondary constructs arising from specific groupings of data. Agency is perspectival: from Alice's perspective Bob may not qualify as an observer, and vice versa. These results redefine the observer in the operational approach as a tool to avoid non-causality. They also provide a criterion for Wigner's friends as a class of causally compatible agents.

Conclusion: 该论文的结论表明，基于K-正则图的量子电池在特定条件下表现出与系统规模线性相关的工作输出，且提取工作的分数在子系统中可以独立于系统规模，但其依赖于初始状态。

Abstract: Regular graphs find broad applications ranging from quantum communication to quantum computation. Motivated by this, we investigate the design of a quantum battery based on a K-regular graph, where K denotes the number of edges incident on each vertex. We prove that a 0-regular graph battery exhibits extractable work that scales linearly with the system-size when charged using a K-regular graph. This linear scaling is shown to persist even when the charging is implemented via a collective K-regular charger with power-law decaying interactions. While no superlinear scaling is observed, the work output is found to improve systematically with increasing regularity K. Furthermore, by introducing the notion of the fraction of extractable work when only subsystems are accessible, we identify this fraction to be independent of system-size if the battery is prepared in the down-polarized product state. This independence breaks down when the battery is oriented along the x- and y-directions of the Bloch sphere.

Result: The study demonstrates that both chirp and pulse duration modulate vibrational coherence and alter branching between competing pathways, enabling controlled changes in quantum yield.

Conclusion: The study establishes a general framework for controlling ultrafast nonadiabatic processes near conical intersections using engineered laser pulses, elucidating the dynamical mechanisms involved.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate coherent control of nonadiabatic dynamics at a conical intersection (CI) using engineered ultrafast laser pulses. Within a model vibronic system, we tailor pulse chirp and temporal profile and compute the resulting wave-packet population and coherence dynamics using projections along the reaction coordinate. This approach allows us to resolve the detailed evolution of wave-packets as they traverse the degeneracy region with strong nonadiabatic coupling. By systematically varying pulse parameters, we demonstrate that both chirp and pulse duration modulate vibrational coherence and alter branching between competing pathways, leading to controlled changes in quantum yield. Our results elucidate the dynamical mechanisms underlying pulse-shaped control near conical intersections and establish a general framework for manipulating ultrafast nonadiabatic processes.

Abstract: Quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories requires careful handling of gauge redundancy. We address this challenge by presenting universal principles for treating gauge symmetry that apply to any quantum simulation approach, clarifying that physical states need not be represented solely by gauge singlets. Both singlet and non-singlet representations are valid, with distinct practical trade-offs, which we elucidate using analogies to BRST quantization. We demonstrate these principles within a complete quantum simulation framework based on the orbifold lattice, which enables explicit and efficient circuit constructions relevant to real-world QCD. For singlet-based approaches, we introduce a Haar-averaging projection implemented via linear combinations of unitaries, and analyze its cost and truncation errors. Beyond the singlet-approach, we show how non-singlet approaches can yield gauge-invariant observables through wave packets and string excitations. This non-singlet approach is proven to be both universal and efficient. Working in temporal gauge, we provide explicit mappings of lattice Yang-Mills dynamics to Pauli-string Hamiltonians suitable for Trotterization. Classical simulations of small systems validate convergence criteria and quantify truncation and Trotter errors, showing concrete resource estimates and scalable circuit recipes for SU($N$) gauge theories. Our framework provides both conceptual clarity and practical tools toward quantum advantage in simulating non-Abelian gauge theories.

Abstract: We revisit the finite Abelian hidden subgroup problem (AHSP) from a mathematical perspective and make the following contributions. First, by employing amplitude amplification, we present an exact quantum algorithm for the finite AHSP, our algorithm is more concise than the previous exact algorithm and applies to any finite Abelian group. Second, utilizing the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we propose a distributed exact quantum algorithm for finite AHSP, which requires fewer qudits, lower quantum query complexity, and no quantum communication. We further show that our distributed approach can be extended to certain classes of non-Abelian groups. Finally, we develop a parallel exact classical algorithm for finite AHSP with reduced query complexity; even without parallel execution, the total number of queries across all nodes does not exceed that of the original centralized algorithm under mild conditions.

Conclusion: 该论文通过反驳Jeffrey Bub的观点，支持了neo-Bohrian的立场，认为在物理理论中引入数学无限是可行的，并强调了经典与量子物理的互补性。

Abstract: In a recent preprint [1] Jeffrey Bub presents a discussion of neo-Bohrian interpretations of quantum mechanics, and also of von Neumann's work on infinite tensor products [2]. He rightfully writes that this work provides a theoretical framework that deflates the measurement problem and justifies Bohr's insistence on the primacy of classical concepts. But then he rejects these ideas, on the basis that the infinity limit is "never reached for any real system composed of a finite number of elementary systems". In this note we present opposite views on two major points: first, admitting mathematical infinities in a physical theory is not a problem, if properly done; second, the critics of [3,4,5] comes with a major misunderstanding of these papers: they don't ask about "the significance of the transition from classical to quantum mechanics", but they start from a physical ontology where classical and quantum physics need each other from the beginning. This is because they postulate that a microscopic physical object (or degree of freedom) always appears as a quantum system, within a classical context. Here we argue why this (neo-Bohrian) position makes sense.

Result: finding_optimal_pulse-sequence

Conclusion: last_sentence

Abstract: In this work, we formulate the problem of achieving in minimum-time perfect chiral resolution with bounded control fields, as an optimal control problem on two non-interacting spins-$1/2$. We assume the same control bound for the two Raman fields (pump and Stokes) and a different bound for the field connecting directly the two lower-energy states. Using control theory, we show that the optimal fields can only take the boundary values or be zero, the latter corresponding to singular control. Subsequently, using numerical optimal control and intuitive arguments, we identify some three-stage symmetric optimal pulse-sequences, for relatively larger values of the ratio between the two control bounds, and analytically calculate the corresponding pulse timings as functions of this ratio. For smaller values of the bounds ratio, numerical optimal control indicates that the optimal pulse-sequence loses its symmetry and the number of stages increases in general. In all cases, the analytical or numerical optimal protocol achieves a faster perfect chiral resolution than other pulsed protocols, mainly because of the simultaneous action of the control fields. The present work is expected to be useful in the wide spectrum of applications across the natural sciences where enantiomer separation is a crucial task.

Motivation: The motivation is to develop a framework for treating quantum states with specific correlation properties, extending beyond previously studied examples (e.g., 1-uniform states, dual unitary operators) to include tensor network models for the holographic principle.

Method: The method involves analyzing few-body quantum states with maximal bipartite entanglement for selected partitions, encoding these constraints in a graph to define graph-restricted tensors.

Result: The results include the introduction of graph-restricted tensors, which generalize existing concepts and provide new examples of non-stabilizer tensors applicable to holographic lattice models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the novel framework of graph-restricted tensors uncovers a vast landscape of non-stabilizer tensors, which are valuable for lattice models of holography, as demonstrated by exact analytic solutions in concrete cases.

Abstract: We analyze few-body quantum states with particular correlation properties imposed by the requirement of maximal bipartite entanglement for selected partitions of the system into two complementary parts. A novel framework to treat this problem by encoding these constraints in a graph is advocated; the resulting objects are called ``graph-restricted tensors''. This framework encompasses several examples previously treated in the literature, such as 1-uniform multipartite states, quantum states related to dual unitary operators and absolutely maximally entangled states (AME) corresponding to 2-unitary matrices. Original examples of presented graph-restricted tensors are motivated by tensor network models for the holographic principle. In concrete cases we find exact analytic solutions, demonstrating thereby that there exists a vast landscape of non-stabilizer tensors useful for the lattice models of holography.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are among the most promising approaches for simulating interacting quantum many-body systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the practical success of variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) critically depends on the structure of the chosen variational ansatz. In this work, we investigate the ground-state properties of the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain using both generic hardware-efficient ansatz and physics-informed, symmetry-preserving variational circuits. We benchmark variational results against exact diagonalization and noiseless simulations, and subsequently validate the approach on real IQM Garnet quantum hardware. Our results demonstrate that incorporating physical symmetries into the circuit design leads to significantly improved energy estimates, enhanced robustness against hardware noise, and clearer convergence behavior when compared to hardware-efficient ansatz under identical resource constraints. These findings highlight the importance of problem specific ansatz construction for reliable quantum simulations in the NISQ era.

Abstract: We consider the costs and benefits of embedding the states of one quantum system within those of another. Such embeddings are ubiquitous, e.g., in error correcting codes and in symmetry-constrained systems. In particular we investigate the impact of embeddings in terms of the resource theory of nonstabilizerness (also known as magic) quantified via the stabilizer entropy (SE). We analytically and numerically study the stabilizer entropy gap or magic gap: the average gap between the SE of a quantum state realized within a subspace of a larger system and the SE of the quantum state considered on its own. We find that while the stabilizer entropy gap is typically positive, requiring the injection of magic, both zero and negative magic gaps are achievable. This suggests that certain choices of embedding subspace provide strong resource advantages over others. We provide formulas for the average nonstabilizerness of a subspace given its corresponding projector and sufficient conditions for realizing zero or negative gaps: in particular, certain classes of stabilizer codes provide paradigmatic examples of the latter. Through numerical optimization, we find subspaces which achieve both minimal and maximal average SE for a variety of dimensions, and compute the magic gap for specific error-correcting codes and symmetry-induced subspaces. Our results suggest that a judicious choice of embedding can lead to greater efficiency in both classical and quantum simulations.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is among leading candidates for achieving quantum advantage on near-term processors. While typically implemented with a transverse-field mixer (XM-QAOA), the Grover-mixer variant (GM-QAOA) offers a compelling alternative due to its global search capabilities. This work investigates the application of GM-QAOA to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, also known as Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO), which constitute a generalized class of combinatorial optimization tasks characterized by intrinsically multi-variable interactions. We present a comprehensive numerical study demonstrating that GM-QAOA, unlike XM-QAOA, exhibits monotonic performance improvement with circuit depth and achieves superior results for HUBO problems. An important component of our approach is an analytical framework for modeling GM-QAOA dynamics, which enables a classical approximation of the optimal parameters and helps reduce the optimization overhead. Our resource-efficient parameterized GM-QAOA nearly matches the performance of the fully optimized algorithm while being far less demanding, establishing it as a highly effective approach for complex optimization tasks. These findings highlight GM-QAOA's potential and provide a practical pathway for its implementation on current quantum hardware.

Abstract: Circuit simulation tools are critical for developing and assessing quantum-error-correcting and fault-tolerant strategies. In this work, we present SOFT, a high-performance SimulatOr for universal Fault-Tolerant quantum circuits. Integrating the generalized stabilizer formalism and highly optimized GPU parallelization, SOFT enables the simulation of noisy quantum circuits containing non-Clifford gates at a scale not accessible with existing tools. To provide a concrete demonstration, we simulate the state-of-the-art magic state cultivation (MSC) protocol at code distance $d=5$, involving 42 qubits, 72 $T$ / $T^\dagger$ gates, and mid-circuit measurements. Using only modest GPU resources, SOFT performs over 200 billion shots and achieves the first ground-truth simulation of the cultivation protocol at a non-trivial scale. This endeavor not only certifies the MSC's effectiveness for generating high-fidelity logical $T$-states, but also reveals a large discrepancy between the actual logical error rate and the previously reported values. Our work demonstrates the importance of reliable simulation tools for fault-tolerant architecture design, advancing the field from simulating quantum memory to simulating a universal quantum computer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to generalize the stabilizer entropy for states to unitaries, providing a measure of how close a unitary is to a Clifford unitary.

Method: The method involves introducing Clifford entropy, analyzing its properties (invariance, subadditivity), rewriting it in terms of stabilizer entropy, and deriving numerical and analytical bounds.

Result: Results include proving Clifford entropy properties, deriving bounds, and showing concentration of measure results for Haar random unitaries.

Conclusion: The paper concludes with several directions for future research.

Abstract: We introduce the Clifford entropy, a measure of how close an arbitrary unitary is to a Clifford unitary, which generalizes the stabilizer entropy for states. We show that this quantity vanishes if and only if a unitary is Clifford, is invariant under composition with Clifford unitaries, and is subadditive under tensor products. Rewriting the Clifford entropy in terms of the stabilizer entropy of the corresponding Choi state allows us to derive an upper bound: that this bound is not tight follows from considering the properties of symmetric informationally complete sets. Nevertheless we are able to numerically estimate the maximum in low dimensions, comparing it to the average over all unitaries, which we derive analytically. Finally, harnessing a concentration of measure result, we show that as the dimension grows large, with probability approaching unity, the ratio between the Clifford entropy of a Haar random unitary and that of a fixed magic gate gives a lower bound on the depth of a doped Clifford circuit which realizes the former in terms of the latter. In fact, numerical evidence suggests that this result holds reliably even in low dimensions. We conclude with several directions for future research.

Abstract: Developing and deploying advanced Quantum Repeater (QR) technologies will be necessary to scale quantum networks to longer distances. Depending on the error mitigation mechanisms adopted to suppress loss and errors, QRs are typically classified into memory-based or all-photonic QRs; and each type of QR may be best suited for a specific type of underlying quantum technology, a particular scale of quantum networks, or a specific regime of operational parameters. We perform theoretical analysis and simulations of quantum repeaters and networks to investigate the relative performance and resource requirements of different quantum network paradigms. Our results will help guide the optimization of quantum hardware and components and shed light on the role of a robust control plane. We present our research findings on theoretical analysis and simulations of memory-based first-generation trapped-ion quantum repeaters and networks, and all-photonic entanglement-based quantum repeaters and networks. We study the relative performance in terms of entanglement generation rate and fidelity, as well as the resource requirements of these two different quantum network paradigms.

Conclusion: 明确结论

Abstract: Nonclassical light sources are central to emerging quantum technologies, yet current platforms offer limited tunability and typically operate at low photon numbers. In parallel, strong-field physics provides widely tunable, bright coherent radiation through high-order harmonic generation (HHG), but its quantum optical character has remained largely unexplained. While recent experiments have revealed signatures of entanglement, squeezing, and quantum-state modification in both the driving and generated fields, a unified theoretical framework capable of identifying the origin and controllability of these effects has been missing. Here we introduce a fully quantum, analytically tractable theory of intense light-matter interaction that rigorously captures the emergence of nonclassicality in HHG. Our approach employs a parametric factorization of the coupled electron-field system into a driven electronic state and a dynamically perturbed quantum optical field, derived directly from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation without requiring conditioning, homodyne detection, or mode-selection techniques. We show how quantum correlations, squeezing, and Wigner-function negativity arise intrinsically from the interaction dynamics, and we identify the precise conditions under which specific nonclassical features are amplified or suppressed. The theory enables predictive design of bright, high-photon-number quantum states at tunable frequencies, and we demonstrate its utility by outlining realistic conditions for generating bright nonclassical ultraviolet light. Our results establish a comprehensive foundation for strong-field quantum optics and open new avenues toward tabletop quantum light sources for sensing, communication, and photonic quantum information processing.

Abstract: Criticality-based quantum sensing exploits hypersensitive response to system parameters near phase transition points. This work uncovers two metrological advantages offered by topological phase transitions when the probe is prepared as topological edge states. Firstly, the order of topological band touching is found to determine how the metrology sensitivity scales with the system size. Engineering a topological phase transition with higher-order band touching is hence advocated, with the associated quantum Fisher information scaling as $ \mathcal{F}_Q \sim L^{2p}$, with $L$ the lattice size in one dimension, and $p$ the order of band touching. Secondly, with a topological lattice accommodating degenerate edge modes (such as multiple zero modes), preparing an $N$-particle entangled state at the edge and then adiabatically tuning the system to the phase transition point grows quantum entanglement to macroscopic sizes, yielding $\mathcal{F}_Q \sim N^2 L^{2p}$. This work hence paves a possible topological phase transition-based route to harness entanglement, large lattice size, and high-order band touching for quantum metrology.

Conclusion: LogosQ达到了量子模拟计算性能和正确性的新标准

Abstract: Developing robust and high performance quantum software is challenging due to the dynamic nature of existing Python-based frameworks, which often suffer from runtime errors and scalability bottlenecks. In this work, we present LogosQ, a high performance backend agnostic quantum computing library implemented in Rust that enforces correctness through compile time type safety. Unlike existing tools, LogosQ leverages Rust static analysis to eliminate entire classes of runtime errors, particularly in parameter-shift rule gradient computations for variational algorithms. We introduce novel optimization techniques, including direct state-vector manipulation, adaptive parallel processing, and an FFT optimized Quantum Fourier Transform, which collectively deliver speedups of up to 900 times for state preparation (QFT) and 2 to 5 times for variational workloads over Python frameworks (PennyLane, Qiskit), 6 to 22 times over Julia implementations (Yao), and competitive performance with Q sharp. Beyond performance, we validate numerical stability through variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) experiments on molecular hydrogen and XYZ Heisenberg models, achieving chemical accuracy even in edge cases where other libraries fail. By combining the safety of systems programming with advanced circuit optimization, LogosQ establishes a new standard for reliable and efficient quantum simulation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that CIMs can serve as versatile optical simulators for quantum critical phenomena, bridging quantum-spin models and photonic quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) in coherent Ising machines (CIMs) are studied via a spectral mapping between the one-dimensional XY spin model and a network of degenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPOs). This exact correspondence reveals that the DOPO network faithfully reproduces the quantum critical behavior of the XY model across its anisotropic, isotropic, and transverse-field Ising regimes. The ground-state energy density and its derivatives are analyzed to reveal second-order QPTs characterized by singularities in magnetic susceptibility at critical points. These results show that CIMs do not only serve as powerful platforms for solving combinatorial optimization problems but also provide a versatile optical simulator for studying universal quantum critical phenomena, bridging quantum-spin models and photonic quantum systems.

Conclusion: This content has not passed the compliance test and has been hidden.

Abstract: If the phase space-based Sudarshan-Glauber distribution, $P_ρ$, has negative values the quantum state, $ρ$, it describes is nonclassical. Due to $P$'s singular behavior this simple criterion is impractical to use. Recent work [Bohmann and Agudelo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 133601 (2020)] presented a general, sensitive, and noise-tolerant certification functional, $ξ_{P}$, for the detection of non-classical behavior of quantum states $P_ρ$. There, it was shown that when this functional takes on negative values somewhere in phase space, $ξ_{P}(x,p) < 0$, this is \emph{sufficient} to certify the nonclassicality of a state. Here we give examples where this certification fails. We investigate states which are known to be nonclassical but the certification functions is positive $ξ(x,p) \geq 0$ everywhere in phase space. We generalize $ξ$ giving it an appealing form which allows for improved certification. This way we generate the best family of certification functions available so far. Yet, they also fail for very weakly nonclassical states, in other words, the question how to faithfully certify quantumness remains an open question.

Motivation: To explore a universal method for generating squeezed Fock states that is independent of particle distribution among detectors.

Method: Investigates the generation of squeezed Fock states using particle-number measurements in multimode Gaussian states, identifies a universal class of states, and evaluates probability and robustness.

Result: A universal class of N-mode Gaussian states is identified where measuring N-1 modes generates squeezed Fock states, with higher probability than nonuniversal schemes.

Conclusion: The universal scheme for generating squeezed Fock states via particle-number measurements in multimode Gaussian states provides higher probability of generation compared to nonuniversal schemes, though it requires more experimental resources.

Abstract: We investigate the generation of squeezed Fock states (SFSs) via particle-number measurements in the modes of multimode Gaussian states. We identify a universal class of $N$-mode Gaussian states for which measuring $N-1$ modes results in the generation of SFSs. The key feature of these states is that the generated SFSs depend only on the total number of detected particles and are independent of their distribution among the detectors. Based on the general form of the wave functions of multimode Gaussian states, we propose a universal scheme for SFS generation. For this scheme, we evaluate the probability of SFS generation and analyze the robustness of the process against imperfections in particle-number-resolving detectors. In addition, we compare the universal scheme with a nonuniversal scheme, in which the generation of SFSs depends on a specific distribution of particle numbers across the detectors. We demonstrate that the universal scheme provides a higher probability of SFS generation, at the cost of increased experimental resources.

Conclusion: Rashomon现象与胶合失败现象有关

Abstract: Recently Szangolies has argued (in the setting of extended Wigner's-friend scenarios) that quantum theory permits ``Rashomon'' situations: multiple internally coherent accounts of events that cannot be combined into a single, consistent global narrative. This note explains why the Rashomon phenomenon can be understood as a \emph{failure of gluing}: local descriptions over different contexts exist, but they do not admit a single global ``all-perspectives-at-once'' description. This is the same mathematical obstruction that underlies modern sheaf-theoretic treatments of contextuality. I then indicate why the same perspective is useful in parts of the social sciences (quantum-like modelling of cognition, judgment, and decision-making), where ``context effects'' can likewise be interpreted as the absence of a single joint probability space.

Method: The paper theoretically analyzes the impact of feedforward losses and noise on teleportation fidelities, proposes correction methods through appropriate feedforward gain, and evaluates security under public channel attacks.

Result: The study shows that imperfections can be corrected by feedforward gain, derives modified no-cloning thresholds for finite-size codebooks, and identifies security thresholds differing from conventional no-cloning values.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the feasibility of using quantum teleportation in realistic microwave networks for robust and unconditionally secure communication, contributing to the advancement of quantum communication protocols.

Abstract: Quantum communication exploits non-classical correlations to achieve efficient and unconditionally secure exchange of information. In particular, the quantum teleportation protocol allows for a deterministic and secure transfer of unknown quantum states by using pre-shared quantum entanglement and classical feedforward communication. Quantum teleportation in the microwave regime provides an important tool for high-fidelity remote quantum operations, enabling distributed quantum computing with superconducting circuits and potentially facilitating short-range, open-air microwave quantum communication. In this context, we consider practical application scenarios for the microwave analog quantum teleportation protocol based on continuous-variable states. We theoretically analyze the effect of feedforward losses and noise on teleportation fidelities of coherent states and show that these imperfections can be fully corrected by an appropriate feedforward gain. Furthermore, we consider quantum teleportation with finite-size codebooks and derive modified no-cloning thresholds as a function of the codebook configuration. Finally, we analyze the security of quantum teleportation under public channel attacks and demonstrate that the corresponding secure fidelity thresholds may drastically differ from the conventional no-cloning values. Our results contribute to the general development of quantum communication protocols and, in particular, illustrate the feasibility of using quantum teleportation in realistic microwave networks for robust and unconditionally secure communication.

Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising strategy for solving complex optimization problems by encoding the solution into the ground state of a problem Hamiltonian. While most implementations rely on spin-$1/2$ systems, we explore the performance of quantum annealing on a spin-$1$ system where the problem Hamiltonian includes a single ion anisotropy term of the form $D\sum (S^z)^2$. Our results reveal that for a suitable range of the anisotropy strength $D$, the spin-$1$ annealer reaches the ground state with higher fidelity. We attribute this performance to the presence of the intermediate spin level and the tunable anisotropy, which together enable the algorithm to traverse the energy landscape through smaller, incremental steps instead of a single large spin flip. This mechanism effectively lowers barriers in the configuration space and stabilizes the evolution. These findings suggest that higher spin annealers offer intrinsic advantages for robust and flexible quantum optimization, especially for problems naturally formulated with ternary decision variables.

Abstract: We investigated experimentally and theoretically a cavity-free microwave field that couples the two ground states of a Λ-type atomic system, thereby forming a closed Δ configuration. In this regime, the absence of cavity-imposed phase matching leads to a strong sensitivity of the ground-state coherence to the microwave field parameters. We observe that the coherent population trapping (CPT) resonance exhibits a pronounced dependence on the microwave power and detuning, resulting in measurable changes in resonance contrast, linewidth, and center frequency. To explain these effects, we develop a numerical density-matrix model in which the ground-state coherence explicitly incorporates the microwave coupling strength, capturing the essential physics of this no-phase-matching Δ system. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment establishes a simple and robust framework for microwave control of cavity-free Δ-type atomic systems, with direct implications for compact atomic clocks and quantum-enhanced quantum sensing platforms.

Abstract: The van der Waals interaction between neutral atoms is typically studied using stationary perturbation theory for the short-distance (London) limit, while long-distance (Casimir-Polder) results are usually derived via semiclassical, time-dependent approaches. In this pedagogical article, we demonstrate that reformulating stationary perturbation theory calculations in terms of time-ordered correlation functions significantly simplifies the mathematical treatment. This reformulation is particularly advantageous for higher-order calculations required in the long-distance regime, where retardation effects become important. Our approach provides a unified framework that connects both limiting cases while offering a clear conceptual picture suitable for advanced quantum mechanics courses.

Abstract: Linearly polarized projections are the tacit means for performing Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell-inequality tests using polarization-entangled photon pairs. The inequality is valid for all states on the Poincaré-Bloch sphere, but few laboratory studies have investigated violations with the full sphere. In this article, we explore the experimental verifications of the predicted violations of the CHSH inequality with Bell and non-Bell states with same and different linear and elliptically polarized basis states for each photon. We find that Bell states violate CHSH when using the same basis for both photons, regardless of their ellipticity, whereas they show no violations for photon projections in different bases. We found non-Bell maximally-entangled states for which the converse is true.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Twirling, uniform averaging over symmetry actions, is a standard tool for reducing the description of quantum states and channels to symmetry-invariant data. We develop a framework for averaging quantum channels based on channel-state duality that converts pre- and post-processing averages into a group twirl acting directly on the Choi operator. For arbitrary unitary representations on the input and output spaces, the twirled channel is obtained as an explicit projection onto the commutant of the induced representation on $\mathcal H_{\rm out}\otimes \mathcal H_{\rm in}$. In the collective setting, where the commutant is the walled Brauer algebra, we introduce a partial-transpose reduction that maps channel twirling to an ordinary Schur-Weyl twirl of the partially transposed Choi operator, enabling formulas in terms of permutation operators. We further extend the construction beyond compact symmetries to reductive non-unitary groups via Cartan decomposition, yielding a weighted sum of invariant-sector projections with weights determined by the Abelian component. Finally, we provide two finite realizations of channel averaging. The first one is a ``dual'' averaging protocol as a convex mixture of unitary-$1$-design channels on invariant sectors. The second one is a notion of channel $t$-designs induced by weighted group $t$-designs for $t=t_{\rm in}+t_{\rm out}$.

Abstract: Closed timelike curves (CTCs) challenge our conception of causality by allowing information to loop back into its own past. Any consistent description of such scenarios must avoid time-travel paradoxes while respecting the no-new-physics principle, which requires that the set of operations available within any local spacetime region remain unchanged, irrespective of whether CTCs exist elsewhere. Within an information-theoretic framework, this leads to process functions: deterministic classical communication structures that remain logically consistent under arbitrary local operations, yet can exhibit correlations incompatible with any definite causal order - a phenomenon known as non-causality. In this work, we provide the first complete recursive characterization of process functions and of (non-)causal process functions. We use it to establish a correspondence between process functions and unambiguous complete product bases, i.e., product bases in which every local state belongs to a unique local basis. This equivalence implies that non-causality of process functions is exactly mirrored by quantum nonlocality without entanglement (QNLWE) - the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing separable states using local operations and causal classical communication - for such bases. Our results generalize previous special cases to arbitrary local dimensions and any number of parties, enable systematic constructions of non-causal process functions and unambiguous QNLWE bases, and reveal an unexpected connection between certain non-signaling inequalities and causal inequalities.

Abstract: The emerging field of quantum magnonics seeks to understand and harness the quantum properties of magnons -- quantized collective spin excitations in magnets. Squeezed magnon states arise naturally as the equilibrium ground states of anisotropic ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, representing an important class of nonclassical magnon states. In this work, we show how a qubit-conditioned quantum quench of an anisotropic ferromagnet can be used for Heisenberg-limited parameter estimation based on measurements of the qubit only. In the presence of ground-state squeezing, the protocol yields information about the eigenmode frequency of the coupled magnon-qubit system, whereas no information is gained in the absence of such squeezing. The protocol therefore leverages genuine quantum correlations in the form of magnonic squeezing while simultaneously relying on the equilibrium character of this squeezing -- a feature distinctive to magnetic systems.

Abstract: This document presents a concise overview of the contemporary research directions in quantum computer cybersecurity. The aim of this document is not to be a survey, but rather a succinct summary of the major research directions in quantum computer cybersecurity at the end of the first half of the current decade. The document has been inspired by the presentations and discussions held at the 3$^{rd}$ Quantum Computer Cybersecurity Symposium, but goes beyond the contents of the symposium and aims to summarize at the high level the last five years of quantum computer cybersecurity work in academia. It is hoped that the document can provide researchers as well as government and industry leaders an overview of the current landscape of security threats and defenses against emergent quantum computing technologies. The document also includes a discussion of the current trends in cybersecurity research on quantum computers, and the perceived research gaps that should be filled with future funding and through academic and industry~research.

Abstract: We present an analytical model showing how the gauge-invariant loop phase in a three-level closed-loop atomic system imprints as bright-dark lobes in Laguerre Gaussian probe beam intensity patterns. In the weak probe limit, the output intensity in such systems include Beer-Lambert absorption, a scattering term and loop phase dependent interference term with optical depth controlling visibility. These systems enable mapping of arbitrary phases via interference rotation and offer a platform to measure Berry phase. Berry phase emerge as a geometric holonomy acquired by the dark states during adiabatic traversal of LG phase defined in a toroidal parameter space. Manifesting as fringe shifts which are absent in open systems, experimental realization using cold atoms or solid state platforms appears feasible, positioning structured light in closed-loop systems as ideal testbeds for geometric phases in quantum optics.

Abstract: The study of quantum correlations within relativistic spacetimes, and the consequences of relativistic causality on information processing using such correlations, has gained much attention in recent years. In this paper, we establish a unified framework in the form of operational no-signalling constraints to study both nonlocal and temporal correlations within general relativistic spacetimes. We explore several intriguing consequences arising from our framework. Firstly, we show that the violation of the operational no-signalling constraints in Minkowski spacetime implies either a logical paradox or an operational infringement of Poincaré symmetry. We thereby examine and subvert recent claims in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 110401 (2022)] on the possibility of witnessing operationally detectable causal loops in Minkowski spacetime. Secondly, we explore the possibility of jamming of nonlocal correlations, controverting a recent claim in [Nat. Comm. 16, 269 (2025)] that a physical mechanism for jamming would necessarily lead to superluminal signalling. Finally, we show that in black hole spacetimes certain nonlocal correlations under and across the event horizon can be jammed by any agent without spoiling the operational no-signalling constraints.
