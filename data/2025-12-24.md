### [1] [Observation of flat-band skin effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19745)
*Xulong Wang,Dongyi Wang,Congwei Lu,Ruo-Yang Zhang,Ching Hua Lee,Kun Ding,Guancong Ma*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Non-Hermitian flat bands exhibit a unique skin effect (FBSE) driven by dispersive bands' topology, not the flat band itself, experimentally confirmed in a mechanical lattice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) can occur in flat bands, despite their topological triviality, and to uncover the underlying mechanisms and experimental manifestations.

Method: The authors investigated non-Hermitian skin effects in flat bands using theoretical and experimental approaches, focusing on spectral topology and wavefunction behavior under periodic and open boundary conditions.

Result: FBSE arises from the non-trivial spectral topology of dispersive bands, persists only within a finite range of non-Hermitian parameters, and involves gap-closing at higher-order exceptional points, leading to singular wavefunction behavior. Experimental validation was achieved in a mechanical lattice.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the flat-band skin effect (FBSE) in non-Hermitian systems is linked to the non-trivial spectral topology of dispersive bands, not the flat band itself, and experimentally validates these findings in a mechanical lattice. This highlights unique flat-band phenomena in non-Hermitian systems and potential applications in quantum geometry and localization control.

Abstract: Symmetry-protected ideal flat bands in one-dimensional (1D) Hermitian lattices are populated by compact localized states (CLS) - a special class of localization with wavefunctions confined within a small region. In this work, we discover that the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) can appear in a flat band. Unlike conventional NHSEs for dispersive bands that are protected by nontrivial point-gap topology, the flat band remains a point on the complex-energy plane and is therefore always topologically trivial. We found that, intriguingly, the flat-band skin effect (FBSE) is associated with the non-trivial spectral topology of the dispersive bands enclosing the flat band on the complex-energy plane, so it only emerges within a finite range of non-Hermitian parameters and can counterintuitively disappear at large non-Hermiticity. Moreover, the gaps between the flat and the dispersive bands can close at higher-order exceptional points under both periodic and open boundary conditions. The flat-band wavefunctions are discontinuous in quantum distance across these exceptional points, signifying that the gap-closing is singular. The FBSE was experimentally observed in a non-Hermitian mechanical lattice. Our work reveals flat-band phenomena unique to non-Hermitian systems and highlights new possibilities in quantum geometry and localization control.

### [2] [Composable, unconditional security without a Quantum secret key: public broadcast channels and their conceptualizations, adaptive bit transmission rates, fidelity pruning under wiretaps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19759)
*Pete Rigas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores quantum communication protocols without secret keys, analyzing secrecy conditions and demonstrating methods to enhance security against eavesdroppers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether aspects of QKD-dependent protocols can be adapted for unconditional security without secret keys, and to characterize conditions for achieving secrecy and authentication simultaneously.

Method: The paper examines quantum channels and protocols, analyzes Eve's error probability with the Holevo information under an optimal decoder, and uses post-processing of CPTP maps to reduce Holevo sums.

Result: The study shows the existence of protocols enabling Alice and Bob to map into the authenticated space of bit codewords with high probability, and highlights the potential for quantum advantage through performance gaps.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that forward conceptual channels, through cascading, can significantly increase Eve's probability of false acceptance, and demonstrates methods to decrease Holevo sum quantities with data-processing and entropy-continuity bounds.

Abstract: We examine public broadcast, forward conceptual, and backward conceptual, Quantum channels in the context of communication protocols that are independent of secret keys. Given research directions of interest previously identified in arXiv: 1804.01797, besides converse upper bounds on the bit transmission rate obtained by the author in recent work (arXiv: 2507.03035), additional possibilities remain, including: (1) determining whether aspects of QKD dependent protocols can be incorporated into steps of QKD independent protocols; (2) whether there would be any amplification to the Quantum-classical performance gap that Alice and Bob can exploit towards prospective Quantum advantage; (3) formulating the conditions under which secrecy and authentication can be simultaneously achieved. To characterize the conditions for which secrecy can be achieved with high probability, we argue that there not only exists suitable protocols which enable Alice and Bob to map into the authenticated space of bit codewords with high probability, but also that forward conceptual channels, through cascading, can significantly increase Eve's probability of false acceptance. Albeit the fact that secrecy, along with conceputalizations of the public broadcast channel, were initially discussed by Maurer for QKD dependent protocols, determining whether aspects of such protocols can be adapted for unconditional security without the use of a secret key is of great interest to explore. We demonstrate that Eve's error probability, through the cascading procedure, can be analyzed with the Holevo information under an optimal decoder. Furthermore, through post-processing of the outputs of a Completely Positive Trace Preserving (CPTP) map, we also demonstrate how to decrease Holevo sum quantities with data-processing and entropy-continuity bounds.

### [3] [Theory of Scalable Spin Squeezing with Disordered Quantum Dipoles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19781)
*Avi Kaplan-Lipkin,Philip J. D. Crowley,Jonathan N. Hallén,Zilin Wang,Weijie Wu,Sabrina Chern,Chris R. Laumann,Lode Pollet,Norman Y. Yao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores spin squeezing in disordered dipolar systems, revealing its persistence near the Heisenberg point and proposing a solution to address dimer-induced heating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim is to understand and develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in disordered dipolar spin systems, which are prevalent in experimental setups like ultracold molecules, nuclear spin ensembles, and solid-state color centers.

Method: The research employs quantum Monte Carlo simulations to map the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order and scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, focusing on the effects of disorder and Ising anisotropy.

Result: The results indicate that scalable spin squeezing persists near the Heisenberg point despite increasing disorder. The study identifies tightly-coupled dimers as a key challenge and proposes a feasible strategy to mitigate their impact.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that scalable spin squeezing in a randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles can be achieved by addressing the issue of tightly-coupled dimers, particularly near the Heisenberg point. This finding is significant for experimental implementations with systems like nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.

Abstract: Spin squeezed entanglement enables metrological precision beyond the classical limit. Understood through the lens of continuous symmetry breaking, dipolar spin systems exhibit the remarkable ability to generate spin squeezing via their intrinsic quench dynamics. To date, this understanding has primarily focused on lattice spin systems; in practice however, dipolar spin systems$\unicode{x2014}$ranging from ultracold molecules to nuclear spin ensembles and solid-state color centers$\unicode{x2014}$often exhibit significant amounts of positional disorder. Here, we develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, which naturally realize a dipolar XXZ model. Via extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order, and by extension scalable spin squeezing, as a function of both disorder and Ising anisotropy. As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench. In the case of strongly-interacting nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that an experimentally feasible strategy to decouple the problematic dimers from the dynamics is sufficient to enable scalable spin squeezing.

### [4] [Learning transitions of topological surface codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19786)
*Finn Eckstein,Bo Han,Simon Trebst,Guo-Yi Zhu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates how measurements affect topological quantum order, showing logical information is preserved for generic angles, with a learning transition in biased cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand how measurements on qubits affect the topological order of a quantum state and to determine the extent to which logical quantum information can be learned from classical snapshots of such measurements.

Method: The study analyzes measurements on qubits in a uniform basis, focusing on projective measurements and their impact on topological order. The measurement ensemble is represented by a 2D tensor network, which is fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model.

Result: The results show that logical information is preserved for generic measurement angles, either by maintaining topological order (weak measurements) or transferring information to the observer (projective measurements). A learning transition occurs when the measurement angle is biased, reducing the tomographic information obtainable.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that topological quantum order can robustly encode logical quantum information unless the measurement basis is biased towards specific directions, leading to a learning transition described as a 'metal to insulator' transition.

Abstract: For the surface code, topological quantum order allows one to encode logical quantum information in a robust, long-range entangled many-body quantum state. However, if an observer probes this quantum state by performing measurements on the underlying qubits, thereby collecting an ensemble of highly correlated classical snapshots, two closely related questions arise: (i) do measurements decohere the topological order of the quantum state; and (ii) how much of the logical information can one learn from the snapshots? Here we address these questions for measurements in a uniform basis on all qubits. We find that for generic measurement angles, sufficiently far away from the Clifford X, Y, and Z directions (such as the X+Y+Z basis) the logical information is never lost in one of the following two ways: (i) for weak measurement, the topological order is absolutely robust; (ii) for projective measurement, the quantum state inevitably collapses, but the logical quantum information is faithfully transferred from the quantum system to the observer in the form of a tomographically complete classical shadow. At these generic measurement angles and in the projective-measurement limit, the measurement ensemble enforced by Born probabilities can be represented by a 2D tensor network that can be fermionized into a disordered, free-fermion network model in symmetry class DIII, which gives rise to a Majorana "metal" phase. When the measurement angle is biased towards the X or Z limits, a critical angle indicates the threshold of a learning transition beyond which the classical shadow no longer reveals full tomographic information (but reduces to a measurement of the logical X or Z state). This learning transition can be described in the language of the network model as a "metal to insulator" transition...

*T. Rick Perche,Natália Salomé Móller,Guilherme Franzmann*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper shows that passive quantum reference frame transformations cannot create entanglement between physical systems, with implications for the perspectival framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the conditions under which subsystems become entangled after a quantum reference frame transformation.

Method: The paper distinguishes between quantum systems acting as reference frames and physical systems described relative to these frames, defining passive quantum reference frames.

Result: A necessary condition is identified for subsystems to become entangled post-transformation, and it is shown that passive quantum reference frame transformations cannot produce entanglement between physical systems.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that transformations between passive quantum reference frames cannot generate entanglement between physical systems, and the results extend to the perspectival framework even without distinguishing between physical and reference systems.

Abstract: We find a necessary condition for subsystems to become entangled after a quantum reference frame transformation. By distinguishing between quantum systems suitable to act as reference frames and physical systems described relative to these frames, we define passive quantum reference frames and show that transformations between these cannot produce entanglement between physical systems. Our results also apply to the study of entanglement between subsystems in the perspectival framework even when there is no distinction between physical and reference systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scalability limitations of alkaline-earth-like atoms for quantum computation, simulation, and metrology, despite their long coherence times and high-fidelity Rydberg gates.

Method: Enhanced single-atom loading efficiency (83.5%) in optical tweezer arrays and estimation of high-fidelity two-qubit gates using ground-clock state manifold encoding.

Result: Successful trapping of 2,400 Ytterbium-174 atoms with maintained loading efficiency across varying array sizes and robust applicability across interatomic potentials. Estimated two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.9%.

Conclusion: The work advances the prospects for large-scale quantum computers using alkaline-earth-like atoms, such as Ytterbium-174, by demonstrating scalability and high-fidelity quantum operations.

Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum computation, simulation, and metrology. Among them, alkaline-earth-like atoms exhibit distinct advantages, including long coherence time and high-fidelity Rydberg gates. However, their scalability has lagged behind that of the alkali atoms. Here, we report 2,400 Ytterbium-174 atoms trapped in an optical tweezer array with enhanced single-atom loading efficiency of 83.5(1)%. Notably, the loading efficiency is largely maintained for array sizes ranging from dozens to thousands, exhibiting excellent scalability. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the enhanced loading method by showing that the enhancement exists robustly across a range of interatomic potentials, suggesting its utility for other atomic species. To establish the capability of the 174Yb arrays toward universal quantum computation, we propose to encode the qubit in the ground-clock state manifold and estimate a 99.9% two-qubit gate fidelity with experimentally feasible parameters. Our work advances the prospects for realizing large-scale quantum computers using alkaline-earth-like atoms.

### [7] [Ergotropy of quantum many-body scars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19801)
*Zhaohui Zhi,Qingyun Qian,Jin-Guo Liu,Guo-Yi Zhu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum many-body scars can store extractable energy efficiently, with a dynamical protocol enabling energy injection, applicable to quantum battery engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the capacity of quantum many-body scars in storing extractable energy (ergotropy), a property not previously explored, and its potential for quantum battery applications.

Method: Focusing on the PXP model, the study analyzes the extensive ergotropy scaling of states interpolating between quantum many-body scars and thermal states, and introduces a dynamical protocol with a global uniform coherent rotation.

Result: A phenomenological relation between ergotropy and entanglement is uncovered, generalizing free fermion integrable results to interacting scenarios. The dynamical protocol demonstrates the injection of extractable energy, suitable for near-term Rydberg neutral atom arrays and other quantum processors.

Conclusion: Quantum many-body scars can be efficiently utilized for storing extractable energy, offering a promising approach for engineering quantum many-body batteries.

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars break ergodicity and evade thermalization, resulting in area law entanglement entropy even with high energy density. While their quantum correlations and entanglement have been elaborated previously, their capacity in storing extractable energy, quantified by the notion ergotropy, remains an open question. Here we focus on the representative PXP model, and unveil the extensive ergotropy scaling of a family of states interpolating between quantum many-body scars and thermal states, the latter of which are known to be passive with vanishing ergotropy. A phenomenological relation between ergotropy and entanglement is uncovered, which generalizes the existing free fermion integrable results to an interacting scenario. The ergotropy in a dynamical protocol shows that a reset with a global uniform coherent rotation can inject extractable energy, as a proof of principle way to charge a quantum "battery". Our protocol is tailored for near term Rydberg neutral atoms array, while also being feasible for other quantum processors. Our results establish that quantum many-body scars, despite the tiny fraction of the Hilbert space they occupy, can be efficiently exploited for storing extractable energy, and "scarring" a many-body system as a promising route for engineering quantum many-body battery.

### [8] [Local Operations and Field Mediated Entanglement without a Local Tensor Product Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19806)
*Alberto Spalvieri,Sébastien Christophe Garmier,Flaminia Giacomini*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper bridges quantum information theory and gauge theories by defining a gauge-invariant locality framework, showing how entanglement protocols work in gauge theories without local tensor-product structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the incompatibility between quantum information theory's reliance on subsystem locality and the gauge constraints in gauge theories, which prevent a spacetime-local tensor product structure. The paper aims to reconcile these discrepancies.

Method: The authors analyze a two-dimensional lattice gauge model that mimics electromagnetism. They construct gauge-invariant local algebras and derive a decomposition of the Hilbert space to address the lack of a local tensor-product structure. They apply this framework to field-mediated entanglement protocols.

Result: The study demonstrates that a discretized version of electromagnetism satisfies an analogue of the LOCC theorem, showing entanglement cannot be generated without genuine quantum field interactions, even in the absence of a local tensor-product structure.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a framework to bridge the gap between quantum information theory and gauge theories by constructing gauge-invariant local algebras and deriving a physically meaningful decomposition of the Hilbert space. This allows for an operationally consistent notion of locality, even without a local tensor-product structure. The results suggest a potential operational way to define subsystem structures for gauge theories.

Abstract: Quantum information has become a powerful tool for probing the structure of quantum field theories, yet its application to gauge theories remains subtle. On the one hand, quantum information theory assumes subsystem locality, i.e.~the factorization of the total Hilbert space into subsystems. On the other hand, gauge constraints prevent the total Hilbert space to decompose into a spacetime-local tensor product structure. Because the Hilbert space structure of gauge theories does not accommodate the subsystem decomposition used in quantum information theory, standard information-theoretic results, such as the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) theorem, cannot be used straightforwardly in the context of gauge theories. In this work, we bridge this gap in the case of a two-dimensional lattice gauge model that captures key features of electromagnetism. In particular, we construct gauge-invariant local algebras and derive a physically meaningful decomposition of the Hilbert space, providing an operationally consistent notion of locality in the absence of a local tensor-product structure. We apply this framework to field-mediated entanglement protocols relevant to proposed tests of the quantum nature of gravity. We show that the discretized version of electromagnetism satisfies an analogue of the LOCC theorem: entanglement cannot be generated without genuine quantum field interactions, even in the absence of a spacetime-local tensor product factorization of the Hilbert space. This may point towards an operational way to define a subsystem structure for gauge theories.

### [9] [Fundamentals of quantum Boltzmann machine learning with visible and hidden units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19819)
*Mark M. Wilde*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper advances quantum Boltzmann machine training by deriving gradient expressions for quantum relative entropy and Petz-Tsallis relative entropy, enabling quantum algorithms for gradient estimation in generative modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The primary motivation is to generalize the classical Boltzmann machine's training approach to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines, specifically addressing the challenge of gradient estimation in the presence of both visible and hidden units.

Method: The author derives analytical expressions for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the model distribution of a quantum Boltzmann machine. The approach involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations and extends to quantum algorithms for gradient estimation. The method is also specialized to cases with quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa.

Result: The paper successfully derives analytical gradient expressions and develops quantum algorithms for estimating them, advancing the training of quantum Boltzmann machines for generative modeling and quantum state learning.

Conclusion: This paper presents significant progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines by deriving analytical expressions for gradients of quantum relative entropy and Petz-Tsallis relative entropy, along with quantum algorithms for estimating these gradients. It addresses a longstanding obstacle in quantum state learning and generative modeling.

Abstract: One of the primary applications of classical Boltzmann machines is generative modeling, wherein the goal is to tune the parameters of a model distribution so that it closely approximates a target distribution. Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations. Ultimately, this paper demarcates progress in training quantum Boltzmann machines with visible and hidden units for generative modeling and quantum state learning.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how a non-interacting 2D quantum gas in a weak random potential evolves over time, showing that initial peaked momentum distributions become isotropic and broaden, validated by simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the long-time behavior of a non-interacting two-dimensional quantum gas in a weak random potential with long-range correlations, specifically focusing on how initial momentum distributions evolve over time.

Method: The study involves deriving an expression for the long-time average of the momentum distribution and validating it through computer simulations. The analysis also includes discussions on momentum isotropization and spatial diffusion.

Result: The results show that any peaked initial momentum distribution will isotropize and broaden over time due to scattering events with the random potential. The derived expression for the long-time average momentum distribution is confirmed by simulations.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that any peaked initial momentum distribution in a non-interacting two-dimensional quantum gas subjected to a weak random potential with long-range correlations will eventually become isotropic and broaden. The derived expression for the long-time average of the momentum distribution aligns with computer simulations, and momentum isotropization and spatial diffusion are discussed.

Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of a non-interacting two-dimensional quantum gas in a weak random potential with long-range correlations. Any peaked initial momentum distribution will eventually become isotropic and broaden due to scattering events with the random potential. We derive an expression for the long-time average of the momentum distribution and test it against computer simulations. We also discuss momentum isotropization and spatial diffusion.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We show how combining a discrete symmetry with topological Hilbert space fragmentation can give rise to exponentially many topologically stable qubits protected by a single discrete symmetry. We illustrate this explicitly with the example of the $\mathsf{CZ}_p$ model, where the encoded qubits are stable to arbitrary symmetry-respecting perturbations for parametrically long times, substantially enhancing the robustness of a recently proposed construction based on nontopological fragmentation. In this model, the encoded qubits naturally come in pairs for which a universal set of transversal logical gates can be performed, ruling out (by the Eastin-Knill theorem) the possibility of using them for quantum error correction. We also comment on the combination of symmetry enrichment and topological fragmentation more generally, and the implications for use of systems exhibiting Hilbert space fragmentation as quantum memories.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Starting from square-integrable wave functions on a Lie group, we build an invertible Fourier transform mapping them on wave functions on the dual of the Lie algebra. This is a group-theoretic version of the map from position space to momentum space, with generally noncommuting momenta owing to the group structure. As a result, the multiplication of momentum-dependent functions involves star products, which makes the construction of noncommutative Fourier series much more involved than that of their commutative cousin. We show that our formalism provides an isometry of Hilbert spaces, and use it to derive a noncommutative Poisson summation formula for any compact Lie group. This is a key preliminary for the computation of Wigner functions and path integrals for quantum systems on group manifolds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the transition from independent to synchronized dynamics in quantum and classical models and identify distinguishing features.

Method: Analyzed emission trajectories from a driven-dissipative two-qubit system and a classical telegraph model using Lempel-Ziv complexity, mutual information, and temporal correlations.

Result: Quantum trajectories develop enhanced complexity and sustained information sharing at large drive-to-decay ratio, while classical correlations are short-lived. A strong complexity-information correlation uniquely appears in the quantum case.

Conclusion: Complexity and information measures extracted from jump records efficiently distinguish quantum and classical dynamics in open systems.

Abstract: We analyze emission trajectories from a driven-dissipative two-qubit system and a classical telegraph model with matched rates. Using Lempel-Ziv complexity, mutual information, and temporal correlations, we show that both models undergo a transition from independent to synchronized dynamics as coupling increases, but only the quantum trajectories develop enhanced complexity and sustained information sharing at large drive-to-decay ratio. Classical correlations are short-lived and quickly suppressed by strong drive. A strong complexity-information correlation appears uniquely in the quantum case, providing a clear trajectory-level signature of quantum effects. These results show that complexity and information measures extracted directly from jump records provide an efficient way to distinguish quantum and classical dynamics in open systems.

Motivation: To explore the emergence of distinct discrete time crystals (DTCs) in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model under nonuniform periodic driving.

Method: Semi-classical analysis and studies of quantum fluctuations.

Result: Demonstrated that distinct DTC orders can coexist spatially with varying sub-harmonic responses, confirmed stable in the thermodynamic limit and under quantum fluctuations.

Conclusion: Spatially structured driving is a powerful method to engineer novel forms of time-crystalline order, enabling distinct DTCs in different spatial regions.

Abstract: We examine the distinct discrete time crystals (DTCs) that emerge in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, subjected to spatially nonuniform periodic driving. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that by appropriately tailoring the drive protocol, distinct DTC orders can be realized in different spatial regions of the system. Consequently, the system exhibits spatially varying sub-harmonic responses with distinct frequencies. We employ a semi-classical analysis to establish the stability of these co-existing DTC orders in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we establish the stability of the stability of these co-existing DTCs in the presence of quantum fluctuations. Our results establish spatially structured driving as a powerful route to engineer novel forms of time-crystalline order.

TL;DR: FMS resolves the failure of standard topological invariants in 'Wild' systems by introducing Stokes invariants as new quantum numbers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the catastrophic failure of standard topological invariants in open, driven, and non-Hermitian systems due to essential singularities.

Method: Introduction of the Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy (FMS) protocol to extract the hidden Stokes Phenomenon and map Stokes multipliers to time-domain observables.

Result: FMS enables the exact reconstruction of non-perturbative physics from divergent asymptotic series, providing a bridge to Resurgence Theory.

Conclusion: The 'Stokes Invariant' is established as a new quantum number for classifying phases of matter beyond conventional topology, validated in a superconducting qudit model.

Abstract: Standard topological invariants, such as the Chern number and Berry phase, form the bedrock of modern quantum matter classification. However, we demonstrate that this framework undergoes a \textbf{catastrophic failure} in the presence of essential singularities -- ubiquitous in open, driven, and non-Hermitian systems ("Wild" regime). In these settings, the local geometric tensor diverges, rendering standard invariants ill-defined and causing perturbative predictions to deviate from reality by order unity ($\sim 100\%$). We resolve this crisis by introducing the \textbf{Floquet-Monodromy Spectroscopy (FMS)} protocol, a pulse-level control sequence, which experimentally extracts the hidden \textit{Stokes Phenomenon} -- the "missing" geometric data that completes the topological description. By mapping the singularity's Stokes multipliers to time-domain observables, FMS provides a rigorous experimental bridge to \textbf{Resurgence Theory}, allowing for the exact reconstruction of non-perturbative physics from divergent asymptotic series. We validate this framework on a superconducting qudit model, demonstrating that the "Stokes Invariant" serves as the next-generation quantum number for classifying phases of matter beyond the reach of conventional topology.

Abstract: Despite the fact that power-law interactions occur in a plethora of physical systems, their many-body dynamics is far less understood than that of nearest-neighbor interacting systems. Here, we study information scrambling in strongly disordered spin systems with power-law interactions via out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). Numerically, we find pronounced differences in the dynamical spreading of OTOCs between nearest-neighbor and power-law interacting systems. This deviation persists even for short-range interactions, opposing the common view that these interactions produce dynamics equivalent to the nearest-neighbor case. In a detailed experimental proposal, tailored but not limited to Rydberg tweezer setups, we present a protocol to extract OTOCs in XXZ Heisenberg spin systems with tunable anisotropy and programmable disorder based on currently available techniques.

*Debashish Dutta,Sayan Choudhury*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Non-Hermitian Creutz ladder shows rich spectral transitions, exceptional lines, and flat bands with unique dynamical signatures under different boundary conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the rich spectral and dynamical properties of a non-Hermitian Creutz ladder with generic non-reciprocal hopping, particularly the transitions between real and complex spectra and the emergence of exceptional points.

Method: The analysis involves mapping the non-Hermitian Creutz ladder onto two decoupled non-Hermitian SSH chains and performing exact analytical diagonalization under different boundary conditions.

Result: Under periodic boundary conditions, a fine-tuned line with entirely real eigenvalues is found, while deviations induce a real-complex spectral transition. Open boundary conditions reveal extended regions of purely real or imaginary spectra separated by exceptional lines, leading to a structured phase diagram with triple-junction points.

Conclusion: The study reveals that flat bands in the non-Hermitian Creutz ladder can manifest as both Hermitian diabolical points and non-Hermitian exceptional points, with the latter exhibiting more stringent dynamics and unique spectral signatures.

Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian extension of the Creutz ladder with generic non-reciprocal hopping. By mapping the ladder onto two decoupled non-Hermitian Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (SSH) chains, we uncover a rich structure in parameter space under different boundary conditions. Under periodic boundary conditions, the spectrum admits a fine-tuned line in parameter space with entirely real eigenvalues, while deviations from this line induce a real--complex spectral transition without crossing exceptional points. In contrast, an exact analytical diagonalization under open boundary conditions reveals extended regions in parameter space with purely real or purely imaginary spectra, separated from complex spectral domains by exceptional lines. The intersections of these exceptional lines define triple-junction points where distinct spectral regimes meet, giving rise to a structured phase diagram that is absent under periodic boundary conditions. We further show that flat bands in this system can occur both as Hermitian diabolical points and as non-Hermitian exceptional points, known as exceptional flat bands, where the dynamics is more stringent than in the Hermitian case, leading to distinct spectral and dynamical signatures.

Abstract: Electronic excited states are central to a vast array of physical and chemical phenomena, yet accurate and efficient methods for preparing them on quantum devices remain challenging and comparatively underexplored. We introduce a general dissipative algorithm for selectively preparing ab initio electronic excited states. The key idea is to recast excited-state preparation as an effective ground-state problem by suitably modifying the underlying Lindblad dynamics so that the target excited state becomes the unique steady state of a designed quantum channel. We develop three complementary strategies, tailored to different types of prior information about the excited state, such as symmetry and approximate energy. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of these schemes through numerical simulations of atomic and molecular spectra, including valence excitations in prototypical planar conjugated molecules and transition-metal complexes. Taken together, these results provide a new pathway for advancing quantum simulation methods for realistic strongly correlated electronic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend the lifetime of logical bosonic qubits and improve entanglement generation and swapping success probabilities beyond traditional methods.

Method: Utilizes autonomous error correction with bosonic grid states, involving a transmon and two bosonic resonators for memory and entanglement generation. Employs deterministic entanglement generation via microwave photon absorption and all-bosonic Bell-state measurement.

Result: Achieves entanglement generation success probability ~0.75 and swapping success probability ~0.58, surpassing the traditional 1/2 limit. Demonstrates feasibility with current technology.

Conclusion: The proposed GBMQR can achieve high entanglement generation and swapping success probabilities with current superconducting microwave technology, making it suitable for secure communication and distributed quantum computing.

Abstract: In autonomous quantum error correction the lifetime of a logical bosonic qubit can be extended beyond its physical constituents without feedback measurements. Leveraging autonomous error correction, we propose a second-generation gate-based microwave quantum repeater (GBMQR) with encoded bosonic grid states. Each repeater station comprises a transmon and two bosonic resonators: one resonator serving as a stationary quantum memory utilizing autonomous error correction, and the other as an information bus for entanglement generation. Entanglement is generated sequentially through the successful absorption of a microwave photon wavepacket. This method enables deterministic entanglement generation, in contrast to a probabilistic mixing of two heralding signals on a balanced beamsplitter. Furthermore, our GBMQR employs an all-bosonic entanglement swapping Bell-state measurement. This is implemented via a bosonic controlled-Z gate and two separate X-basis projective homodyne measurements on the stationary stored codewords. Our approach circumvents mode-mismatch losses associated with routing and interfering of heralding modes on a beamsplitter, and confines losses to those arising from stationary storage. We evaluate the performance of the proposed quantum repeater by calculating its secret key rate under realistic lab environments. Moreover, we explicitly demonstrate that at stationary damping rate of $κ^{-1}_{\text{damp}}=$~\SI{40}{\milli\second}, GBMQR can achieve entanglement generation and swapping success probabilities approx.~$0.75$, and $0.58$ respectively, surpassing the hallmark success probability of $1/2$ set by ideal linear beamsplitter-based Bell-state measurements. The proposed device can be implemented using currently available superconducting microwave technology and is suited for secure chip-to-chip communication and distributed quantum computing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the hardware overhead and scalability limitations imposed by traditional parametric down-conversion methods for quantum-limited amplification in superconducting qubit readout.

Method: The study demonstrates a DC-powered broadband amplifier, the Inelastic Cooper-pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA), which uses a voltage-biased SQUID to achieve quantum-limited amplification through inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling.

Result: The ICTA delivers 13 dB of average gain across a 3.5 GHz bandwidth in a single stage, operating within 0.2 photons of the quantum limit. Semiclassical simulations accurately predict its performance.

Conclusion: The broadband ICTA significantly reduces hardware complexity in superconducting quantum processors by eliminating the need for pump-tone infrastructure, paving the way for scalable quantum-limited amplification.

Abstract: Fast, high-fidelity, single-shot readout of superconducting qubits in quantum processors demands quantum-limited amplifiers to preserve the optimal signal-to-noise ratio. Typically, quantum-limited amplification is achieved with parametric down-conversion of a strong pump tone, which imposes significant hardware overhead and severely limits scalability. Here, we demonstrate the first DC-powered broadband amplifier operating within 0.2 photons of the quantum limit. Our impedance-engineered Inelastic Cooper-pair Tunneling Amplifier (ICTA)-a voltage-biased SQUID in which Cooper pairs tunnel inelastically by emitting signal-idler photon pairs-operates in reflection, delivering 13 dB of average gain across a 3.5 GHz bandwidth in a single stage. Semiclassical simulations accurately predict the gain and saturation power, enabling further design improvements. By eliminating the pump-tone infrastructure, the broadband ICTA promises to dramatically reduce the hardware complexity of quantum-limited amplification in superconducting quantum processors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve ultra-fast gates beyond semi-classical limits and address the breakdown of dynamics in a three-level manifold under strong driving.

Method: Systematic calculation of multi-photon transitions and derivation of analytical formulas (R1D and R2D) to suppress errors, including amplitude and phase errors.

Result: Demonstration of gate infidelities below 10^-5 for a 7ns π-rotation, along with guidelines for optimizing DRAG prefactor and detuning.

Conclusion: The study successfully identifies and suppresses new quantum error channels in the strong driving limit, achieving gate infidelities below 10^-5 for fast gates.

Abstract: Achieving very fast gates that undercut the natural limits set by decoherence requires going into the strong driving limit. Realizing single-qubit control predicted beyond semi-classical, time-dependent modeling has yet to be experimentally realized on superconducting and most other computing platforms. In this regime, the common model of dynamics within a three-level manifold breaks down, and instead, we see new quantum error channels growing abruptly with decreasing time. To identify these error processes we systematically calculate the effect of multi-photon transitions that occur out of the computational space. We then derive analytical formulas to suppress these effects, as well as amplitude and phase errors on the qubit space; we term these R1D for suppressing the $|0\rangle-|2\rangle$ transition and R2D when also suppressing $|1\rangle-|3\rangle$ leakage. We also answer long-standing questions about the optimal values of the DRAG prefactor as well as constant detuning, when accounting for time-ordering, and also show how to calibrate other prefactors for further performance improvement. Upon correcting these varied sources of error, we numerically demonstrate gate infidelities below $10^{-5}$ for a 7ns $π$-rotation when incorporating existing decoherence rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating the ORT measure for mixed states with photon number coherence and explore the connection between nonclassicality and metrological power, particularly under the influence of coherence.

Method: The research employs exact analytical calculations for rank-two mixed states and numerical methods for higher-rank states to evaluate the ORT measure. It also compares nonclassicality and metrological power under different coherence conditions.

Result: Exact formulas for the ORT measure of rank-two mixed states were derived, alongside numerical solutions for higher-rank states. The study found that nonclassicality and metrological power may plateau under dephasing but can be enhanced by reducing coherence.

Conclusion: The study provides exact formulas for the ORT measure of rank-two mixed states and numerical solutions for higher-rank states, highlighting the role of coherence and its impact on nonclassicality and metrological power. It reveals that nonclassicality and metrological power can plateau under bosonic dephasing, but reducing coherence might enhance these properties.

Abstract: The operational resource theory (ORT) measure is a nonclassicality measure for bosonic states, notable for its resource-theoretic properties and connection to metrology. However, it can be difficult to evaluate, being linked to an optimization problem for mixed states. Here, we present the first ORT measure calculations for mixed states with photon number coherence. We give exact formulas governing the ORT measure of a broad class of rank-two mixed states, and numerical solutions for some higher-rank states. We also compare the nonclassicality of these states to their metrological power, thus showing in what regimes the metrological power manages to saturate the ORT bound. Throughout, we consider the role of coherence. In particular, we show that nonclassicality and metrological power never increase under bosonic dephasing, but may plateau in a manner similar to entanglement sudden death. Nevertheless, lowering photon number coherence more freely can sometimes yield more nonclassical and metrologically useful states.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to explore and develop quantum-based solutions for traditionally classical problems like SDPs, leveraging the unique capabilities of quantum algorithms (e.g., Grover's algorithm) to outperform classical methods.

Method: A Boolean-based methodology is introduced for constructing SDPs in the quantum domain, utilizing binary reversible circuits and step-decreasing structures shaped operators (Stesso) to build the quantum oracle. The approach is experimentally validated by solving an SDP instance (the matchstick problem) using Grover's algorithm on a noisy simulated quantum computer implemented in Qiskit.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the practical usability of a quantum-based approach for solving Segment Display Problems (SDPs) by applying Grover's algorithm and the proposed methodology on a simulated quantum computer, showcasing its potential in quantum computing applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces a new Boolean-based methodology for constructing Segment Display Problems (SDPs) in the quantum domain and solving them using Grover's quantum search algorithm. In the classical domain, the SDPs are typically solved using various techniques, such as human deduction, heuristic search, and methods for solving Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) that are based on different problem design models. In this paper, our newly introduced methodology proposes a quantum-based approach for solving such SDPs, by building their quantum oracle using binary reversible circuits and our previously proposed step-decreasing structures shaped operators (Stesso). To demonstrate the usability of this proposed method, we experimentally solve an SDP instance of the matchstick problem using Grover's algorithm with a noisy simulated quantum computer implemented in Qiskit.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: QIA is a finite algebraic framework for representing quantum operators, demonstrating that quantum speed-up arises from operator structure, not just Hilbert-space dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify combinatorial index structure, matrix realization, and transformation properties under Walsh-Hadamard-type transforms, and to reformulate the Bernstein-Vazirani problem in a real, finite-dimensional algebraic setting.

Method: Quantum Index Algebra (QIA) uses finite, index-based algebraic representations of quantum operators on Hilbert spaces, allowing operations through discrete index rules rather than dense matrix arithmetic.

Result: QIA reproduces the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm exactly, achieving the same query complexity and circuit depth, recovering the hidden string through symbolic manipulation rather than numerical simulation.

Conclusion: QIA provides a framework for separating genuine quantum resources from algebraic and combinatorial structures, offering new insights into the classical simulability of structured quantum circuits.

Abstract: We introduce Quantum Index Algebra (QIA) as a finite, index-based algebraic framework for representing and manipulating quantum operators on Hilbert spaces of dimension $2^m$. In QIA, operators are expressed as structured combinations of basis elements indexed by Boolean codes, allowing products, commutators, and conjugations to be computed through finite rules on discrete indices rather than through dense matrix arithmetic. This representation unifies combinatorial index structure, explicit matrix realization, and transformation properties under Walsh-Hadamard-type transforms within a single formalism. Using QIA and its associated block-matrix realization, we reformulate the Bernstein-Vazirani hidden-string problem in its phase-oracle form entirely within a real, finite-dimensional algebraic setting. We show that, under structured oracle access, the QIA procedure reproduces the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm exactly and achieves the same asymptotic query complexity and circuit depth as the standard quantum algorithm. In particular, the hidden string is recovered by symbolic manipulation of a sparse algebraic representation of the oracle rather than by numerical simulation of quantum amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the apparent quantum speed-up in this setting is a consequence of operator structure rather than Hilbert-space dimensionality alone. QIA thus provides a precise language for separating genuinely quantum resources from those arising from algebraic and combinatorial structures and offers a new perspective on the classical simulability of structured quantum circuits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The selection of effective quantum neural network architectures for regression tasks is challenging and computationally hard. This work aims to automate this process and compare quantum models with classical methods.

Method: The paper proposes a genetic-algorithm framework to explore quantum-circuit architectures, examining depth, gate configurations, and data-uploading patterns. The approach is evaluated against classical regression models using nonlinear benchmark and analytical functions.

Result: The evolved quantum models are compact yet competitive with classical models. Dataset complexity metrics reliably predict the best quantum architecture, achieving high predictive accuracy in meta-learning scenarios.

Conclusion: This study introduces a genetic-algorithm framework for automated quantum-circuit construction in regression tasks. The evolved quantum models, though compact, achieve competitive performance compared to classical methods. It also demonstrates that dataset complexity metrics can effectively predict the best quantum architecture, paving the way for systematic quantum regression approaches.

Abstract: The performance of quantum neural network models depends strongly on architectural decisions, including circuit depth, placement of parametrized operations, and data-encoding strategies. Selecting an effective architecture is challenging and closely related to the classical difficulty of choosing suitable neural-network topologies, which is computationally hard. This work investigates automated quantum-circuit construction for regression tasks and introduces a genetic-algorithm framework that discovers Reduced Regressor QNN architectures. The approach explores depth, parametrized gate configurations, and flexible data re-uploading patterns, formulating the construction of quantum regressors as an optimization process. The discovered circuits are evaluated against seventeen classical regression models on twenty-two nonlinear benchmark functions and four analytical functions. Although classical methods often achieve comparable results, they typically require far more parameters, whereas the evolved quantum models remain compact while providing competitive performance. We further analyze dataset complexity using twelve structural descriptors and show, across five increasingly challenging meta-learning scenarios, that these measures can reliably predict which quantum architecture will perform best. The results demonstrate perfect or near-perfect predictive accuracy in several scenarios, indicating that complexity metrics offer powerful and compact representations of dataset structure and can effectively guide automated model selection. Overall, this study provides a principled basis for meta-learning-driven quantum architecture design and advances the understanding of how quantum models behave in regression settings--a topic that has received limited exploration in prior work. These findings pave the way for more systematic and theoretically grounded approaches to quantum regression.

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement enables secure group key distribution among multiple users while providing immunity against hacking attacks targeting source devices, thereby realizing source-independent quantum conference key agreement (SI-QCKA). However, previous experimental demonstrations of SI-QCKA have encountered substantial technical challenges, primarily due to the low efficiency and scalability limitations inherent in the generation and distribution of multipartite entanglement. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a scalable and efficient SI-QCKA protocol using polarization-entangled photon pairs in a three-user star network, where Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger correlations are realized via a post-matching method. We achieve a secure group key rate of $2.11 \times 10^{4}$ bits/s under the single-user channel transmission of 1.64 $\times$ $10^{-1}$ in a symmetric channel loss network. Additionally, we conduct six sets of experiments to investigate the impact of varying channel transmission and random basis selection probabilities on secure key rates. Our work establishes an efficient pathway for SI-QCKA and demonstrates potential scalability for future large-scale multi-user quantum networks.

Motivation: Large dimensions of augmented non-Markovian quantum systems cause computational burdens, necessitating a reduction method.

Method: The paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for physical realizability, derives constraints for model reduction, and converts nonlinear equality constraints into inequalities for semidefinite programming.

Result: A theorem for designing the ancillary system matrix is proved, and a numerical example validates the method.

Conclusion: The proposed $ℎ_2$ model reduction method effectively addresses the computational burden in filtering and control of non-Markovian quantum systems, validated by a numerical example.

Abstract: An augmented system model provides an effective way to model non-Markovian quantum systems, which is useful in filtering and control for this class of systems. However, since a large number of ancillary quantum oscillators representing internal modes of a non-Markovian environment directly interact with the principal system in these models, the dimension of the augmented system may be very large causing significant computational burden in designing filters and controllers. In this context, this paper proposes an $\mathscr{H}_2$ model reduction method for the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems. We first establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the physical realizability of the augmented model of linear non-Markovian quantum systems, which are more stringent than those for Markovian quantum systems. However, these physical realizability conditions of augmented system model pose non-convex constrains in the optimization problem of model reduction, which makes the problem different from the corresponding classical model reduction problem. To solve the problem, we derive necessary conditions for determining the input matrix in the reduced model, with which a theorem for designing the system matrix of the ancillary system in the reduced system is proved. Building on this, we convert the nonlinear equality constraints into inequality constraints so that a semidefinite programming algorithm can be developed to solve the optimization problem for model reduction.
  A numerical example of a two-mode linear quantum system driven by three internal modes of a non-Markovian environment validates the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dynamic characteristics of satellite network topology, limited quantum resources, and strict coherence time constraints pose significant challenges to reliable entanglement routing, necessitating an entanglement distribution analysis model.

Method: A comprehensive Markov chain model with a state space defined by link storage age and physical distance is presented, including transition matrices for system dynamics and analytical expressions for key performance metrics.

Result: Analysis reveals trade-offs between higher request rates (faster link consumption with higher fidelity but potentially lower satisfaction rates) and lower request rates (longer storage times at the cost of lower fidelity due to decoherence). It also justifies omitting polarization rotation for short transmission distances (40-50 km).

Conclusion: This work provides theoretical foundations for designing and optimizing quantum entanglement distribution strategies in satellite networks, with applications to global-scale quantum communications.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement routing in dynamic Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks is important for achieving scalable and high-fidelity quantum communication. However, the dynamic characteristics of satellite network topology, limited quantum resources, and strict coherence time constraints pose significant challenges to reliable entanglement routing. An entanglement distribution analysis model for this unique environment is critical and helpful for entanglement routing research. We address the fundamental challenge of establishing and maintaining quantum entanglement links between satellites operating in free space, where links are subject to both transmission losses and quantum memory decoherence. This paper presents a comprehensive Markov chain model with a state space defined by link storage age and physical distance for analyzing entanglement distribution in noisy dynamic LEO satellite quantum networks. We construct transition matrices that capture system dynamics under varying request arrival rates, and derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics, including request satisfaction rate, average waiting time, link utilization efficiency, and average consumed link fidelity. Our analysis reveals that the critical trade-offs of higher request rates lead to faster link consumption with higher fidelity but potentially lower satisfaction rates, while lower request rates allow longer storage times at the cost of lower fidelity of increased decoherence effect. Moreover, this paper proves it is reasonable to leave out polarization rotation when the transmission distance is very short (40-50 km). In summary, this work provides theoretical foundations for designing and optimizing quantum entanglement distribution strategies in satellite networks, with applications to global-scale quantum communications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the susceptibility of ML classifiers in quantum computing systems to physical fault-injection, which can lead to incorrect readout results.

Method: The study uses ChipWhisperer Husky for physical voltage glitching and an automated algorithm to scan fault injection parameters, targeting a 5-qubit readout error-correction model.

Result: Fault susceptibility is layer-dependent, with early layers showing higher misprediction rates. Single-shot glitches induce structured readout corruption, not just random noise.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for treating ML-based quantum computer readout as a security-critical component, advocating for lightweight fault detection and redundancy mechanisms.

Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) classifiers are increasingly used in quantum computing systems to improve multi-qubit readout discrimination and to mitigate correlated readout errors. These ML classifiers are an integral component of today's quantum computer's control and readout stacks. This paper is the first to analyze the susceptibility of such ML classifiers to physical fault-injection which can result in generation of incorrect readout results from quantum computers. The study targets 5-qubit (thus 32-class) readout error-correction model. Using the ChipWhisperer Husky for physical voltage glitching, this work leverages an automated algorithm for scanning the fault injection parameter search space to find various successful faults in all the layers of the target ML model. Across repeated trials, this work finds that fault susceptibility is strongly layer-dependent: early-layers demonstrate higher rates of misprediction when faults are triggered in them, whereas later layers have smaller misprediction rates. This work further characterizes the resulting readout failures at the bitstring level using Hamming-distance and per-bit flip statistics, showing that single-shot glitches can induce structured readout corruption rather than purely random noise. These results motivate treating ML-based quantum computer readout and readout correction as a security-critical component of quantum systems and highlight the need for lightweight, deployment-friendly fault detection and redundancy mechanisms in the quantum computer readout pipelines.

In this setup, coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) can completely remove the back action noise. In addition, increasing the OPA pump gain enables sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL) at reduced laser power. These combined effects allow weak force sensing beyond the SQL.

Abstract: Quantum measurements, alongside quantum states and processes, form a cornerstone of quantum information processing. However, unlike states and processes, their efficient characterisation remains relatively unexplored. We resolve this asymmetry by introducing a comprehensive framework for efficient detector estimation that reveals the fundamental limits to extractable parameter information and errors arising in detector analysis - the \emph{detector quantum Fisher information}. Our development eliminates the need to optimise for the best probe state, while highlighting aspects of detector analysis that fundamentally differ from quantum state estimation. Through proofs, examples and experimental validation, we demonstrate the relevance and robustness of our proposal for current quantum detector technologies. By formalising a dual perspective to state estimation, our framework completes and connects the triad of efficient state, process, and detector tomography, advancing quantum information theory with broader implications for emerging technologies reliant on precisely calibrated measurements.

TL;DR: Edge bursts in quantum walks are affected by boundary effects and imaginary gaps, revealing new dynamics in finite systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamical bulk-edge relation in quantum walks and explore the effects of finite-size boundaries on edge bursts.

Method: Theoretical analysis and experimental observation of quantum walks, with focus on bulk-edge relations and non-Hermitian skin effects.

Result: Boundary scattering suppresses edge bursts in finite-size chains, while imaginary gap opening combined with the non-Hermitian skin effect can enhance edge loss probability.

Conclusion: Edge bursts in finite-size quantum walks are influenced by boundary scattering and imaginary gap opening, providing new insights into finite-size quantum dynamics.

Abstract: A dynamical bulk-edge relation in quantum walks has been theoretically proposed and experimentally observed, in which a power-law dependence of the bulk loss probability is associated with a pronounced peak of loss probability at the edge. This behavior has been proven to arise from imaginary gap closing and the non-Hermitian skin effect in the infinite limit without boundary effects. However, in a finite-size chain, we find that boundary scattering can suppress this edge burst. Meanwhile, imaginary gap opening together with the non-Hermitian skin effect, can also induce a large loss probability at the edge. Our results provide insights into finite-size quantum dynamics.

TL;DR: Optimal STIRAP via quantum geometry improves population transfer efficiency to 98% for three-level systems and enables superposition states in four-level systems, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of population transfer in multi-level quantum systems by leveraging quantum geometry, addressing the limitations of traditional STIRAP schemes.

Method: The study uses the dynamical quantum geometric tensor to optimize the STIRAP scheme, calculating the tensor and nonadiabatic transition rates for Λ-type three-level and tripod-type four-level systems. It investigates transfer dynamics and the influence of system parameters like Rabi pulse operation time, amplitude fluctuation, and detuning.

Result: For three-level systems, the optimal STIRAP scheme achieves 98% transfer efficiency vs. 72% for traditional STIRAP. For four-level systems, it enables efficient superposition state preparation. Adiabatic resonance transfer reduces infidelity below 10^-3.

Conclusion: The optimal STIRAP scheme, based on the dynamical quantum geometric tensor, provides faster and more efficient population transfer compared to the traditional STIRAP scheme, achieving efficiencies over 98% for three-level systems and enabling efficient preparation of superposition states in four-level systems.

Abstract: The optimal control of population transfer for multi-level systems is investigated from the perspective of quantum geometry. Firstly, the general theoretical framework of optimizing the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) scheme based on the dynamical quantum geometric tensor is given, and then the dynamical quantum geometric tensor and the nonadiabatic transition rate are calculated by taking the detuned $Λ$-type three-level system and tripod-type four-level system for example. Secondly, the transfer dynamics of the particle population of the system are investigated in detail. For a three-level system, the optimal STIRAP scheme has an efficiency of over 98\% in transferring the population to the final state, while the transfer efficiency of traditional STIRAP is about 72\%. The superposition states with arbitrary proportions can be efficiently prepared for a four-level system due to the decoupling of the degenerate dark states. Finally, the influences of system parameters, such as the operation time of the Rabi pulses, the amplitude fluctuation and the single-photon detuning, on the transfer process are discussed. Especially, the phenomenon of the adiabatic resonance transfer is revealed. Choosing the pulse parameters in the resonance window can reduce the infidelity of the population transfer to below $10^{-3}$. It is found that the optimal STIRAP scheme by the dynamical quantum geometric tensor provides faster and more efficient transfer than the traditional STIRAP scheme.

Based on that, we establish a systematic method for determining UDA states and provide a complete characterization of the additivity of UDA bipartite and three-qubit product states. We show the application of mixed UDA states and their characterization from the perspectives of tomography and other tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The SiGe spacer in Si/SiGe heterostructures limits the tunability of exchange coupling, leading to unwanted phase shifts and complicating multi-qubit control.

Method: Reconfiguring gate voltages to enable in situ role switching of overlapping nanogates while maintaining multi-qubit control.

Result: Improved tunability of exchange coupling by several orders of magnitude and reduced unintended single-qubit phase shifts.

Conclusion: Swapping the roles of overlapping nanogates improves tunability of exchange coupling and reduces unintended phase shifts, supporting scalable quantum computing with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Silicon quantum dot spin qubits have become a promising platform for scalable quantum computing because of their small size and compatibility with industrial semiconductor manufacturing processes. Although Si/SiGe heterostructures are commonly used to host spin qubits due to their high mobility and low percolation density, the SiGe spacer creates a gap between the qubits and control electrodes, which limits the ability to tune exchange coupling. As a result, residual coupling leads to unwanted single-qubit phase shifts, making multi-qubit control more difficult. In this work, we explore swapping the roles of overlapping nanogates to overcome this issue. By reconfiguring the gate voltages, we demonstrate in situ role switching while maintaining multi-qubit control. Additionally, this method significantly improves the tunability of exchange coupling by several orders of magnitude over the traditional approach. This strategy reduces unintended single-qubit phase shifts and minimizes the complexity of multi-qubit control, supporting scalable growth with minimal experimental overhead.

Abstract: The systematic discovery of effective drug combinations is a challenging problem in modern pharmacology, driven by the combinatorial growth of potential pairings and dosage configurations. Network medicine, modeling diseases and drugs as interconnected modules of the human protein-protein interactome, has emerged as a new paradigm for understanding disease mechanisms and drug action. In this work, we propose a quantum annealing-based algorithm for identifying effective drug combinations. Underlying our approach is the biologically motivated principle of `Complementary Exposure', which posits that therapeutic drug combinations target distinct yet complementary regions of a disease module. We translate this into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation problem. We test our method for Diabetes Mellitus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Asthma, and Brain Neoplasms, relying on experimentally validated drug combinations for these diseases. Our simulated quantum annealing experiments reveal that low-energy configurations align with biologically plausible combinations, demonstrating the algorithm's ability to generate novel predictions for drug combinations.

Abstract: Spin-active colour centres in 4H silicon carbide are promising candidates as building blocks for quantum information applications. To increase the photon count rate of the emitters at low temperatures, the colour centres must be integrated into nanophotonic structures and characterised under cryogenic conditions. Here, we design and fabricate waveguide structures attached with an efficient Dinosaur photonic crystal reflector at one side. The devices show broadband reflection over a range of 60 THz with a peak reflectance above 80 %. Additionally, colour centres were integrated into these structures and characterised at cryogenic conditions. The emission was collected by a tapered-waveguide-tapered-fibre interface. Although the spectral stability of the emitters must be further improved for high excitation powers, the saturation intensity in standard PLE measurements is about 104 kcps. The count rate can be further improved to about 125 kcps with a charge-resonance check measurement scheme. To highlight the relevance of our devices, we theoretically show that these count rates enable optical single-shot readout with a fidelity exceeding 98 %.

Abstract: High-fidelity state transfer is fundamentally limited by time-reversal symmetry: one qubit emits a photon with a certain temporal pulse shape, whereas a second qubit requires the time-reversed pulse shape to efficiently absorb this photon. This limit is often overcome by introducing active elements. Here, we propose an alternative solution: by tailoring the dispersion relation of a waveguide, the photon pulse emitted by one qubit is passively reshaped into its time-reversed counterpart, thus enabling perfect absorption. We analytically derive the optimal dispersion relations in the limit of small and large qubit-qubit separations, and numerically extend our results to arbitrary separations via multiparameter optimization. We further propose a spatially inhomogeneous waveguide that renders the state transfer robust to variations in qubit separations. In all cases, we obtain near-unity transfer fidelity (>= 98%). Our dispersion-engineered waveguide provides a compact and passive route toward on-chip quantum networks, highlighting engineered dispersion as a powerful resource in waveguide quantum electrodynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine conditions under which tree tensor network states (TTNS) can efficiently approximate quantum states by leveraging Schmidt spectra and Rényi entanglement entropies.

Method: The study extends existing results for matrix product states by bounding the approximation error of TTNS using Schmidt spectra or Rényi entanglement entropies, and deriving bounds on required bond dimensions for specific accuracy.

Result: It is demonstrated that efficient TTNS approximations exist when Rényi entanglement entropies for single-branch cuts adhere to an area law (α<1), applicable to ground and low-energy states of certain gapped systems.

Conclusion: Tree tensor network states (TTNS) can efficiently approximate quantum states if the Rényi entanglement entropies for single-branch cuts follow an area law, as observed in certain gapped systems.

Abstract: Extending corresponding results for matrix product states [Verstraete and Cirac, PRB 73, 094423 (2006); Schuch et al. PRL 100, 030504 (2008)], it is shown how the approximation error of tree tensor network states (TTNS) can be bounded using Schmidt spectra or Rényi entanglement entropies of the target quantum state. Conversely, one obtains bounds on TTNS bond dimensions needed to achieve a specific approximation accuracy. For tree lattices, the result implies that efficient TTNS approximations exist if $α<1$ Rényi entanglement entropies for single-branch cuts obey an area law, as in ground and low-energy states of certain gapped systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the properties of a PT-symmetric non-Hermitian spin--boson model and understand its differences from Hermitian and finite-mode non-Hermitian systems.

Method: The static properties are analyzed using a projection method derived from the displacement operator, while the time evolution of observables is investigated via the Dirac--Frenkel time-dependent variational principle.

Result: Only a single exceptional point emerges, with a single real eigenvalue before the EP. Distinct dynamical signatures are observed, including sustained oscillations in the PT-unbroken phase and accelerated decoherence in the PT-broken phase.

Conclusion: The study highlights the unique properties of the PT-symmetric non-Hermitian spin--boson model, particularly the emergence of a single exceptional point and distinct dynamical behaviors in PT-unbroken and PT-broken phases. It demonstrates how PT symmetry can stabilize coherent light--matter interactions in non-Hermitian systems.

Abstract: This work studies a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric non-Hermitian spin--boson model, consisting of a non-Hermitian two-level system coupled to a continuous bosonic bath. The static properties of the system are analyzed through a projection method derived from the displacement operator. We find that only a single exceptional point (EP) emerges, in contrast to non-Hermitian spin--boson models with finite modes, which typically exhibit multiple EPs. Notably, only a single real eigenvalue is found before the EP, which differs markedly from typical non-Hermitian systems where a pair of real eigenvalues precedes the EP. The time evolution of observables is further investigated via the Dirac--Frenkel time-dependent variational principle. Compared to its Hermitian counterpart, the non-Hermitian model exhibits distinct dynamical signatures, most notably the emergence of oscillations with periodic amplified amplitude. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-unbroken phase, the system exhibits sustained oscillatory dynamics with suppressed decoherence, whereas in the $\mathcal{PT}$-broken phase, additional dissipative channels accelerate decoherence and drive rapid convergence toward a stable steady state. These results shed light on how $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry protects coherent light--matter interactions in non-Hermitian quantum systems.

Motivation: To study how ergodic quantum dynamics in the nonintegrable transverse-field Ising model can be suppressed by spatial inhomogeneity in interaction strengths.

Method: Partitioning the chain into two equal segments with different coupling strengths and analyzing the dynamics using diagnostics like out-of-time-ordered correlators, level-spacing statistics, and spectral form factor.

Result: Variation in the inhomogeneity parameter away from unity leads to constrained dynamics, as demonstrated by multiple diagnostics.

Conclusion: Introducing a macroscopic inhomogeneity in coupling strengths provides a minimal, disorder-free route to breaking ergodicity in the nonintegrable transverse-field Ising model.

Abstract: The nonintegrable transverse-field Ising model is a common platform for studying ergodic quantum dynamics. In this work, we introduce a simple variant of the model in which this ergodic behaviour is suppressed by introducing a spatial inhomogeneity in the interaction strengths. For this we partition the chain into two equal segments within which the spins interact with different coupling strengths. The ratio of these couplings defines an inhomogeneity parameter, whose variation away from unity leads to constrained dynamics. We characterize this crossover using multiple diagnostics, such as the long-time saturation of out-of-time-ordered correlators, level-spacing statistics, and the spectral form factor. We further examine the consequences for operator growth in Krylov space and for entanglement generation in the system's eigenstates. Together, these results demonstrate that introducing a macroscopic inhomogeneity in coupling strengths provides a minimal, disorder-free route to breaking ergodicity in this specific model of interacting spins.

Motivation: To analyze the behavior of quantum systems with complex mass and Morse potential, identifying distinct regimes of spectral characteristics and intrinsic matter types.

Method: Exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation for a quantum system with complex mass subjected to a complex Morse potential in the extended complex phase space.

Result: Derived normalized eigenfunctions and eigenspectra within a non-Hermitian framework, established conditions for the reality of the spectra, and identified five classes of matter with distinct spectral and physical properties.

Conclusion: The study provides a unified framework for interpreting the stability, resonance, and emergent classicality in complex quantum systems with complex mass and Morse potential, revealing five distinct matter types.

Abstract: We present exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation for a quantum system with complex mass subjected to a complex Morse potential in the extended complex phase space. The normalized eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenspectra are derived within a non-Hermitian framework, ensuring consistent probability densities. Conditions for the reality of the spectra are established and used to analyze the dependence of eigenvalue behaviour on potential parameters. The study reveals distinct regimes of spectral characteristics arising from the interplay of complex mass, the Morse parameter, and eigenvalues, leading to the emergence of five intrinsic matter types. By analysing the energy eigenspectra, normalization conditions, and probability density profiles across parameter space, we identify regimes corresponding to real-spectrum Hermitian-like matter, quasi-stable or resonant states, purely complex quantum matter, non-physical, non-normalizable states, and a quasi-classical determinate regime in which the probability density becomes spatially static. One of these system exhibits a non-dissipative, collisionless state with long-range gravitational-like characteristics, suggesting a theoretical analogue for dark matter within a non-Hermitian quantum framework. Further, the five identified classes of matter may be interpreted as distinct phases of a single quantum system governed by complex mass and Morse parameters This classification elucidates the boundary between physical and non-physical regimes in complex quantum systems and provides a unified approach for interpreting stability, resonance, and emergent classicality arising from complex parameters.

TL;DR: Study resolves gauge ambiguities in QPT for three-level atoms, showing unified gauge equivalence and non-Hermitian effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the long-standing gauge-choice ambiguity in the description of quantum phase transitions for three-level atoms in a cavity and explore the effects of Hermitian and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.

Method: The study employs a spin coherent-state variational method to analyze QPT, including energy spectrum, average photon number, and atomic population changes. Time-dependent gauge transformation resolves gauge-choice ambiguities.

Result: The unified gauge resolves the ambiguity, showing equivalence between different gauges under resonant conditions but differences in detuning. Non-Hermitian interactions lead to exceptional points and unstable superradiant states, limiting the system to NP.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the quantum phase transition (QPT) from the normal phase (NP) to the superradiant phase (SP) in three-level atoms in a cavity is sensitive to gauge choices, initial optical-phase, and Hermitian versus non-Hermitian interactions. The unified gauge resolves gauge-choice ambiguities, while non-Hermitian interactions lead to unstable superradiant states, restricting the system to NP.

Abstract: We study in this paper the quantum phase transition (QPT) from normal phase (NP) to superradiant phase (SP) for $N$ three-level atoms in a single-mode optical cavity for both Hermitian and non Hermitian Hamiltonians, where the $Ξ$-type three-level atom is described by spin-$1$ pseudo-spin operators. The long standing gauge-choice ambiguity of $\mathbf{A\cdot p}$ and $\mathbf{d\cdot E}$ called respectively the Coulomb and dipole gauges is resolved by the time-dependent gauge transformation on the Schrödinger equation. Both $\mathbf{A\cdot p}$ and $\mathbf{d\cdot E}$ interactions are included in the unified gauge, which is truly gauge equivalent to the minimum coupling principle. The Coulomb and dipole interactions are just the special cases of unified gauge. Remarkably three interactions lead to the same results under the resonant condition of field-atom frequencies, while significant difference appears in red and blue detunings. The QPT is analyzed in terms of spin coherent-state variational method, which indicates the abrupt changes of energy spectrum, average photon number as well as the atomic population at the critical point of interaction constant. Crucially, we reveal the sensitive dependence on the initial optical-phase, which is particularly useful to test the validity of three gauges experimentally. The non-Hermitian atom-field interaction results in the exceptional point (EP), beyond which the semiclassical energy function becomes complex. However the energy spectrum of variational ground state is real in the absence of EP, and does not become complex. The superradiant state is unstable due to the non-Hermitian interaction induced photon-number loss. Thus only the NP exists in the non-Hermitian Dicke Model Hamiltonian.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges of high-dimensional and non-commutative quantum dynamics under time-dependent driving, particularly for high-order terms in the Magnus expansion.

Method: The method involves a scalable approach to compute the Magnus expansion, focusing on Hamiltonians with a constant drift term and a controllable term, providing a polynomial expression for faster evaluation.

Result: The result demonstrates a polynomial expression for the Magnus expansion that can be evaluated much faster than previous techniques, applied to design control pulses for a 5-qubit phase gate on a neutral-atom platform.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the introduced scalable approach significantly reduces computational effort for computing high-order terms in the Magnus expansion, enabling practical applications in quantum simulation and control.

Abstract: The evolution of a quantum system under time-dependent driving exhibits phenomena that are absent in its stationary counterpart. However, the high dimensionality and non-commutative nature of quantum dynamics make this a challenging problem. The Magnus expansion provides an analytic framework to approximate the effective dynamics on short time-scales, but computing high-order terms with existing methods is computationally expensive. We introduce a scalable approach that reduces the computational effort to depend only on the degrees of freedom defining the time-dependent control function. We focus specifically on Hamiltonians consisting of a constant drift term and a controllable term. Our method provides a polynomial expression for the Magnus expansion which can be evaluated several orders of magnitude faster than previous techniques, enabling broad applications in the realms of quantum simulation and quantum optimal control. We showcase an application of the method by designing control pulses for the 5-qubit phase gate on a neutral-atom platform utilizing Rydberg atoms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the geometric form of Hall's exact uncertainty relation and its implications for quantum dynamics, including the role of the first Lanczos coefficient in determining the intrinsic speed scale.

Method: The study analyzes Hall's exact uncertainty relation in the Krylov basis generated by the Liouvillian, focusing on the evolution of the operator amplitude vector on the unit Krylov sphere.

Result: The uncertainty equality implies that the operator amplitude vector evolves on the unit Krylov sphere with constant speed fixed by the first Lanczos coefficient, yielding an exact linear bound on geometric operator evolution.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified geometric interpretation of exact quantum speed limits and operator growth, identifying the first Lanczos coefficient as the intrinsic speed scale of quantum dynamics.

Abstract: We show that Hall's exact uncertainty relation acquires a simple geometric form in the Krylov basis generated by the Liouvillian. In this canonical operator frame, the uncertainty equality implies that the operator amplitude vector evolves on the unit Krylov sphere with constant speed fixed solely by the first Lanczos coefficient. This yields an exact linear bound on geometric operator evolution, independent of higher Lanczos coefficients and valid for arbitrary Hamiltonians, integrable or chaotic. Our results provide the first unified geometric interpretation of exact quantum speed limits and operator growth, identifying the first Lanczos coefficient as the intrinsic speed scale of quantum dynamics.

Motivation: To explore the preservation of optical skyrmions during coherent storage, given their robustness and potential for quantum information storage.

Conclusion: The study marks a significant step towards topologically protected photonic technologies by demonstrating the survival of a non-trivial topological invariant in a quantum memory.

Abstract: Optical skyrmions are topological structures of light whose defining property, the skyrmion number, is robust against perturbations. This makes them attractive for applications in quantum information storage, where resilience to decoherence is paramount. However, their preservation during coherent storage remains unexplored. We report the first experimental demonstration of storing and retrieving optical skyrmions in a cold $^{87}$Rb vapor using a dual-path electromagnetically induced transparency memory. Crucially, we show that the skyrmion number remains invariant for storage times up to several microseconds, even when subjected to imbalanced loss between the two paths and substantial perturbations in control beam power. Our work demonstrates the survival of a non-trivial topological invariant in a quantum memory, marking a significant step towards topologically protected photonic technologies.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper connects metrological performance to long-range entanglement and error correction, showing that super-linear QFI scaling requires such entanglement but is limited by certain codes. Asymmetric structures, however, enable high precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand which many-body quantum states can achieve superlinear scaling of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) with system size, overcoming the limitations imposed by local Hamiltonians and local noise.

Method: A general framework is developed to link metrological performance to long-range entanglement, state-preparation complexity, and quantum error-correction properties. Rigorous complexity-dependent upper bounds on the QFI are derived, and the role of nondegenerate and quantum low-density parity-check codes is analyzed.

Result: Super-linear QFI scaling requires long-range entanglement and is incompatible with nonconstant code distance in certain quantum error-correcting codes. However, asymmetric code structures, such as classical low-density parity-check codes and asymmetric toric code states, enable Heisenberg-limited scaling.

Conclusion: The study establishes long-range entanglement and asymmetric error correction as crucial resources for quantum metrology, elucidating the relationship between state complexity, error correction, and metrological power.

Abstract: Quantum metrology aims to exploit many-body quantum states to achieve parameter-estimation precision beyond the standard quantum limit. For unitary parameter encoding generated by local Hamiltonians, such enhancement is characterized by superlinear scaling of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) with system size. Despite extensive progress, a systematic understanding of which many-body quantum states can exhibit this scaling has remained elusive. Here, we develop a general framework that connects metrological performance to long-range entanglement, state-preparation complexity, and quantum error-correction properties. We prove that super-linear QFI scaling necessarily requires long-range entanglement by deriving rigorous complexity-dependent upper bounds on the QFI. We further show that, for two broad classes of quantum error-correcting codes, nondegenerate codes and Calderbank--Shor--Steane quantum low-density parity-check codes, a nonconstant code distance precludes super-linear QFI scaling for a wide class of local Hamiltonians, revealing a fundamental incompatibility between metrological sensitivity and protection against local noise. Finally, we identify constructive routes that evade this obstruction by exploiting asymmetric code structures. In particular, we show that states associated with classical low-density parity-check codes, as well as asymmetric toric code states, both having asymmetric logical distances, can achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling. Together, our results establish long-range entanglement and asymmetric error correction as the essential resource underlying quantum metrology and clarify the interplay among state complexity, error correction, and metrological power.

Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide an introduction to the use of quantum information methods for investigating the interface between quantum theory and gravity. To this end, we discuss the basic principles of two current research streams that use this approach. The first one explores a phenomenon known as gravitationally induced entanglement, which aims to infer whether the gravitational field responsible for the interaction between two massive bodies must be quantized or not. The second stream investigates causal structures, thereby providing indirect evidence that spacetime may exhibit non-classical behavior. Before presenting these topics, we briefly review some fundamental concepts and experiments from quantum information theory, such as the Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the Stern-Gerlach experiment, Bell inequalities and entanglement, and the language of quantum circuits.

Abstract: We present a footprint study for the scaling of modular quantum error correction (QEC) protocols designed for triangular color codes, including a lattice-surgery-based logical teleportation gadget, and compare the performance of various possible architectures based on trapped ions. The differences in these architectures arise from the technology that enables the connectivity between physical qubits and the modularity required for the QEC gadgets, which is either based on laser-beam deflectors focused to independent modules hosting mid-size ion crystals, or integrated photonics guided to segmented modules of the trap and allowing for the manipulation of smaller ion crystals. Our approach integrates the transpilation of the QEC gadgets into native trapped-ion primitives and a detailed account of the specific laser addressing and ion transport leading to different amounts of crosstalk errors, motional excitation and idle qubit errors. Combining a microscopically-informed noise model with an efficient Pauli-frame simulator and different scalable decoders, we assess the near-term performance of the color-code memory and teleportation protocols on these architectures. Our analysis demonstrates that modular color-code teleportation is achievable in these near-term trapped-ion architectures, and identifies the integrated-photonics connectivity as the most promising route for longer-term scaling.

Motivation: To explore the potential of quantum-inspired methods in improving the tuning of chaotic atmospheric models, leveraging quantum kernels' increased expressivity.

Method: A fully automated tuning process for the Lorenz-96 model using quantum kernels, benchmarked with three architectures and extensive hyperparameter optimization.

Result: Numerical simulations confirm the superiority of two quantum kernels over classical RBF kernels, supported by a dimensionality argument.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum-inspired heuristic shows promise for NISQ devices due to low qubit requirements and moderate circuit depths, with quantum kernels demonstrating superiority over classical RBF kernels.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-inspired heuristic for automatically tuning the Lorenz-96 model -- a simple proxy to describe atmospheric dynamics, yet exhibiting chaotic behavior. Building on the history matching framework by Lguensat et al. (2023), we fully automate the tuning process with a new convergence criterion and propose replacing classical Gaussian process emulators with quantum counterparts. We benchmark three quantum kernel architectures, distinguished by their quantum feature map circuits. A dimensionality argument implies, in principle, an increased expressivity of the quantum kernels over their classical competitors. For each kernel type, we perform an extensive hyperparameter optimization of our tuning algorithm. We confirm the validity of a quantum-inspired approach based on statevector simulation by numerically demonstrating the superiority of two studied quantum kernels over the canonical classical RBF kernel. Finally, we discuss the pathway towards real quantum hardware, mainly driven by a transition to shot-based simulations and evaluating quantum kernels via randomized measurements, which can mitigate the effect of gate errors. The very low qubit requirements and moderate circuit depths, together with a minimal number of trainable circuit parameters, make our method particularly NISQ-friendly.

Motivation: To address the computational limitations of classical diffusion models and their challenges in capturing spatial and spectral correlations in EO data, the authors explore Quantum Machine Learning (QML) as a solution.

Method: The paper introduces the Quanvolutional Conditioned U-Net (QCU-Net), a hybrid quantum-classical architecture that leverages quantum operations within a conditioned diffusion framework using a novel quanvolutional feature-extraction approach.

Result: The QCU-Net shows significant improvements, reducing the Fréchet Inception Distance by 64% and the Kernel Inception Distance by 76%, while achieving higher semantic accuracy.

Conclusion: This work successfully adapts class-conditioned quantum diffusion modeling to the EO domain, demonstrating superior performance in generating synthetic labeled EO imagery. It paves the way for quantum-enhanced remote sensing applications.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of diffusion models (DMs) in the Earth Observation (EO) domain has unlocked new generative capabilities aimed at producing new samples, whose statistical properties closely match real imagery, for tasks such as synthesizing missing data, augmenting scarce labeled datasets, and improving image reconstruction. This is particularly relevant in EO, where labeled data are often costly to obtain and limited in availability. However, classical DMs still face significant computational limitations, requiring hundreds to thousands of inference steps, as well as difficulties in capturing the intricate spatial and spectral correlations characteristic of EO data. Recent research in Quantum Machine Learning (QML), including initial attempts of Quantum Generative Models, offers a fundamentally different approach to overcome these challenges. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce the Quanvolutional Conditioned U-Net (QCU-Net), a hybrid quantum--classical architecture that applies quantum operations within a conditioned diffusion framework using a novel quanvolutional feature-extraction approach, for generating synthetic labeled EO imagery. Extensive experiments on the EuroSAT RGB dataset demonstrate that our QCU-Net achieves superior results. Notably, it reduces the Fréchet Inception Distance by 64%, lowers the Kernel Inception Distance by 76%, and yields higher semantic accuracy. Ablation studies further reveal that strategically positioning quantum layers and employing entangling variational circuits enhance model performance and convergence. This work represents the first successful adaptation of class-conditioned quantum diffusion modeling in the EO domain, paving the way for quantum-enhanced remote sensing imagery synthesis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the vulnerability of classical blockchain systems to advancements in quantum computing and machine learning by leveraging quantum mechanics for security.

Method: The protocol integrates high-dimensional Bell states, time-entanglement, entanglement switching, and high-dimensional superdense coding to encode and verify block information through quantum measurements.

Result: The framework ensures distributed authentication, non-repudiation, and tamper detection while increasing information capacity and noise resistance through high-dimensional coding.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum blockchain protocol utilizes quantum mechanical principles to enhance security and scalability, making it a viable candidate for future quantum network environments.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in quantum computing and machine learning threaten the long-term security of classical blockchain systems, whose protection mechanisms largely rely on computational difficulties. In this study, we propose a quantum blockchain protocol whose protection mechanism is directly derived from quantum mechanical principles. The protocol combines high-dimensional Bell states, time-entanglement, entanglement switching, and high-dimensional superdense coding. Encoding classical block information into time-delimited qudit states allows block identity and data verification to be implemented through the causal sequencing of quantum measurements instead of cryptographic hash functions. High-dimensional coding increases the information capacity per quantum carrier and improves noise resistance. Time-entanglement provides distributed authentication, non-repudiation, and tamper detection across the blockchain. Each block derives its own public-private key pair directly from the observed quantum correlations by performing high-dimensional Bell state measurements in successive time steps. Because these keys are dependent on the time ordering of measurements, attempts to alter block data or disrupt the protocol's timing structure inevitably affect the reconstructed correlations and are revealed during validation. Recent advances in the creation and detection of high-dimensional time-slice entanglement demonstrate that the necessary quantum resources are compatible with emerging quantum communication platforms. Taken together, these considerations suggest that the proposed framework can be evaluated as a viable and scalable candidate for quantum-secure blockchain architectures in future quantum network environments.

Result: The sampling-aware hybrid algorithm achieves a single-shot risk within 1 dB of the -20 dB Bayesian limit using 32 qubits. Demonstrates computational-sensing advantage for direct functional inference.

Conclusion: The eigentask analysis identifies noise-robust feature combinations, enabling compact estimators with improved accuracy and reduced optimization cost.

Abstract: We introduce an end-to-end optimization strategy for quantum machine learning that directly targets performance under finite measurement resources, where learning objectives are defined directly at the level of task performance. The method is applied on a Bayesian quantum metrology task since it provides a natural testbed with known fundamental limits and scaling with system size. The sampling-aware hybrid algorithm achieves a single-shot risk within 1 dB of the -20 dB Bayesian limit using 32 qubits. We extend the Bayesian framework from parameter estimation to global function inference, where the task is to infer a target function of the sensor input drawn from an arbitrary prior, and we demonstrate a clear computational-sensing advantage for direct functional inference over indirect reconstruction. We relate the corresponding Bayesian risk to the Capacity metric and argue that the Resolvable Expressive Capacity provides a natural measure of the space of functions accessible in a single shot. The resulting eigentask analysis identifies noise-robust feature combinations that yield compact estimators with improved accuracy and reduced optimization cost in resource-limited or real-time on-device settings.

Abstract: We investigate the concept of macroscopically distinguishable superpositions within an infinite array of boson sites. Our approach is rigorous within the frame of Hilbert space theory. In this context, it is natural to differentiate between states -- and corresponding dynamics -- that involve only finitely many degrees of freedom, referred to as local, and those that are inherently nonlocal. Previous studies have shown that such systems can support nonlocal coherent states (NCS). In this work, we demonstrate that NCS can dynamically evolve into nonlocal cat states under the influence of a nonlocal Hamiltonian -- specifically, the square of the total number operator. Crucially, the resulting dynamics cannot be decomposed into local factors. Furthermore, we explore broader mathematical implications of these phenomena within the framework of generalized bosons. Our findings highlight that the concepts of coherent states and nonlocal cat states are not inherently bound together; rather, their fusion is a distinctive feature of standard bosons. Finally, we propose that if the generalized boson framework can be physically realized in engineered quantum systems, the phenomena described here may hold significant relevance for both physics and materials science.

Abstract: Famously, the quantum Fisher information -- the maximum Fisher information over all physical measurements -- is additive for independent copies of a system and the optimal measurement acts locally. We are left to wonder: does the same hold when the set of accessible measurements is constrained? Such constraints are necessary to account for realistic experimental restrictions. Here, we consider a fully Gaussian scenario focusing on only Gaussian measurements. We prove that the optimal Gaussian measurement protocol remains local, if the information is encoded in either the displacement or the covariance matrix. However, when the information is imprinted on both, this no longer holds true: we construct a simple global Gaussian measurement where the Fisher information becomes super additive. These results can improve parameter estimation tasks via feasible tools. Namely, in quantum optical platforms our proposed global operation requires only passive global operations and single mode Gaussian measurements. We demonstrate this in two examples where we estimate squeezing and losses. While in the former case there is a significant gap between the Fisher information of the optimal Gaussian measurement and the quantum Fisher information for a single copy, this gap can be reduced with joint Gaussian measurements and closed in the asymptotic limit of many copies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable state preparation on near-term quantum hardware by minimizing circuit depth while preserving the entanglement structure of MPS representations.

Method: The method involves disentangling the target MPS using optimized local unitaries, defining a loss function on Schmidt spectra, and using automatic differentiation to reduce entanglement entropy. The adjoints of the optimized unitaries are then used to construct a shallow-depth circuit.

Result: SSO achieves state-of-the-art shallow-depth performance, improving accuracy by up to an order of magnitude over existing methods and mitigating adverse time-complexity scaling.

Conclusion: SSO provides an efficient and scalable method for preparing many-body quantum states on near-term quantum hardware, significantly outperforming existing methods in terms of accuracy and mitigating time-complexity scaling issues.

Abstract: We introduce an efficient algorithm for the systematic design of shallow-depth quantum circuits capable of preparing many-body quantum states represented as Matrix Product States (MPS). The proposed method leverages Schmidt spectrum optimization (SSO) to minimize circuit depth while preserving the entanglement structure inherent to MPS representations, thereby enabling scalable state preparation on near-term quantum hardware. The core idea is to \textit{disentangle} the target MPS using a sequence of optimised local unitaries, and then reverse this process to obtain a state preparation circuit. Specifically, we define a loss function directly on the Schmidt spectra of intermediate states and use automatic differentiation to optimise each circuit layer so as to systematically reduce entanglement entropy. Once a disentangling sequence has been learned, we take the adjoints of the optimised unitaries to obtain a shallow-depth circuit that approximately reconstructs the target MPS from the computational all-zero state. We benchmark SSO across a range of MPS approximations to the ground states of local Hamiltonians and demonstrate state-of-the-art shallow-depth performance, improving accuracy by up to an order of magnitude over existing methods. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that SSO mitigates the adverse time-complexity scaling observed in previous disentangling-based approaches.

Numerical simulations and experimental validation on a trapped-ion quantum processor are used to evaluate the approach.

Result: The FEI provides a reliable and sufficiently narrow interval-valued estimate of gate fidelity, with its midpoint accurately approximating the true fidelity. Experimental validation confirms the superior performance of the qutrit-based Toffoli gate implementation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the extended CSB model and FEI in addressing limitations of current CSB implementations, particularly in strong noise regimes. The validation on a trapped-ion quantum processor highlights the advantage of the qutrit-based Toffoli gate implementation over the qubit-based counterpart.

Abstract: Channel spectrum benchmarking (CSB) provides a robust framework for characterizing quantum gate fidelities while remaining insensitive to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. Yet, current CSB implementations encounter fundamental challenges when reconstructing noisy eigenvalues, particularly in the presence of spectral degeneracies and off-diagonal noise components in the target gate's eigenbasis. These issues become especially pronounced in the strong noise regime for gates with fidelities around $90\%$. To address these limitations, we introduce an extended CSB model together with a fidelity estimate interval (FEI) -- an interval-valued estimate of the target gate fidelity. Numerical simulation demonstrates that FEI remains sufficiently narrow, with its midpoint reliably approximating the true fidelity. We further validate the protocol on a trapped-ion quantum processor by benchmarking two implementations of the three-qubit Toffoli gate. The results reveal a clear advantage of the qutrit-based implementation over its qubit-based counterpart.

Conclusion: CircPack demonstrates significant advancements in quantum multi-programming for trapped-ion systems, highlighting their potential to improve quantum cloud computing throughput.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of quantum cloud services has led to long job queues due to single-tenant execution models that underutilize hardware resources. Quantum multi-programming (QMP) mitigates this by executing multiple circuits in parallel on a single device, but existing methods target superconducting systems with limited connectivity, high crosstalk, and lower gate fidelity. Trapped-ion architectures, with all-to-all connectivity, long coherence times, and high-fidelity mid-circuit measurement properties, presents itself as a more suitable platform for scalable QMP. We present CircPack, a hardware-aware circuit packing framework designed for modular trapped-ion devices based on the Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architecture. CircPack formulates static circuit scheduling as a two-dimensional packing problem with hardware-specific shuttling constraints. Compared to superconducting-based QMP approaches, CircPack achieves up to 70.72% better fidelity, 62.67% higher utilization, and 32.80% improved layer reduction. This framework is also capable of scalable, balanced scheduling across a cluster of independent QCCD modules, highlighting trapped-ion systems' potential in improving the throughput of quantum cloud computing in the near future.

Motivation: To explore the use of nondeterministic rewriting systems (Wolfram model multiway systems) as a foundation for modeling quantum operators and computation.

Method: Investigation of a specific class of multiway systems based on cyclic character strings (Leibnizian strings) and their causal relations, leading to the construction of quantum gate representations.

Result: Leibnizian strings exhibit a Fermi-Dirac distribution for expectation values and can represent quantum gates (CNOT, π/8, Hadamard) and circuits.

Conclusion: Multiway systems of Leibnizian strings can represent quantum circuits for qubits and qudits, demonstrating their potential in modeling quantum computation.

Abstract: We show how representations of finite-dimensional quantum operators can be constructed using nondeterministic rewriting systems. In particular, we investigate Wolfram model multiway rewriting systems based on string substitutions. Multiway systems were proposed by S. Wolfram as generic model systems for multicomputational processes, emphasizing their significance as a foundation for modeling complexity, nondeterminism, and branching structures of measurement outcomes. Here, we investigate a specific class of multiway systems based on cyclic character strings with a neighborhood constraint - the latter called Leibnizian strings. We show that such strings exhibit a Fermi-Dirac distribution for expectation values of occupation numbers of character neighborhoods. A Leibnizian string serves as an abstraction of a $N$-fermion system. A multiway system of these strings encodes causal relations between rewriting events in a nondeterministic manner. The collection of character strings realizes a $\mathbb{Z}$-module with a symmetric $\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear form. For discrete spaces, this generalizes the notion of an inner product over a vector field. This admits a discrete analogue of the path integral and a $S$-matrix for multiway systems of Leibnizian strings. The elements of this $S$-matrix yield transition amplitudes between states of the multiway system based on an action defined over a sequence of Leibnizian strings. We then show that these $S$-matrices give explicit representations of quantum gates for qubits and qudits, and also circuits composed of such gates. We find that, as formal models of nondeterministic computation, rewriting systems of Leibnizian strings with causal structure encode representations of the CNOT, $π/8$, and Hadamard gates. Hence, using multiway systems one can represent quantum circuits for qubits.

Result: Formally proved the metric as a certified lower bound on the optimal empirical accuracy of any linear classifier in the feature space.

Conclusion: The minimum accuracy heuristic is established as a scalable and theoretically sound tool for pre-screening feature maps on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: The minimum accuracy heuristic evaluates quantum feature maps without requiring full quantum support vector machine (QSVM) training. However, the original formulation is computationally expensive, restricted to balanced datasets, and lacks theoretical backing. This work generalizes the metric to arbitrary binary datasets and formally proves it constitutes a certified lower bound on the optimal empirical accuracy of any linear classifier in the same feature space. Furthermore, we introduce Monte Carlo strategies to efficiently estimate this bound using a random subset of Pauli directions, accompanied by rigorous probabilistic guarantees. These contributions establish minimum accuracy as a scalable, theoretically sound tool for pre-screening feature maps on near-term quantum devices.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A random Stinespring superchannel is introduced, proving the optimal query complexity for learning quantum channels by reducing channel learning to isometry learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the power of random purification channels in quantum information theory, the authors aim to develop a channel-level analogue for practical applications.

Method: The paper introduces a random Stinespring superchannel to transform queries of a quantum channel into parallel queries of a uniformly random Stinespring isometry, with efficient encoding and decoding.

Result: The method matches the performance of existing channel tomography algorithms and closes a logarithmic gap in the dimension, proving the optimal query complexity.

Conclusion: The study fully establishes the optimality of recently introduced channel learning algorithms, showing the optimal query complexity for learning a quantum channel.

Abstract: The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ copies of an arbitrary mixed quantum state into $n$ copies of the same uniformly random purification, has emerged as a powerful tool in quantum information theory. Motivated by this development, we introduce a channel-level analogue, which we call the random Stinespring superchannel. This consists in a procedure to transform $n$ parallel queries of an arbitrary quantum channel into $n$ parallel queries of the same uniformly random Stinespring isometry, via universal encoding and decoding operations that are efficiently implementable. When the channel is promised to have Choi rank at most $r$, the procedure can be tailored to yield a Stinespring environment of dimension $r$. As a consequence, quantum channel learning reduces to isometry learning, yielding a simple channel learning algorithm, based on existing isometry learning protocols, that matches the performance of the two recently proposed channel tomography algorithms. Complementarily, whereas the optimality of these algorithms had previously been established only up to a logarithmic factor in the dimension, we close this gap by removing this logarithmic factor from the lower bound. Taken together, our results fully establish the optimality of these recently introduced channel learning algorithms, showing that the optimal query complexity of learning a quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ is $Θ(d_A d_B r)$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation where the pump source size dominates the overall maser system size, enabling more compact and practical maser devices for quantum applications.

Method: The study utilizes a microwave cavity with a pentacene-doped para-terphenyl crystal pumped by a single, chip-scale LED. Invasive optical pumping via a waveguide embedded into the crystal is employed to reduce system size.

Result: The approach achieves at least a factor of 2 enhancement in cooperativity compared to end-on optical excitation.

Conclusion: The miniaturization of the maser system using a chip-scale LED and invasive optical pumping demonstrates a significant enhancement in cooperativity, making it more practical for applications as quantum sensors, oscillators, and amplifiers.

Abstract: Through their ability to achieve `cryogenic' levels of noise performance while operating at room temperature, optically-pumped, solid-state (OPSS) masers show great promise as quantum sensors, oscillators, and amplifiers. We here demonstrate maser oscillation in a microwave cavity containing a crystal of pentacene-doped \textit{para}-terphenyl (ptc:ptp) pumped by a single, chip-scale LED. Here, unlike previous work, the size of the pump source no longer dominates the size of the maser system as a whole. This miniaturization is achieved through invasive optical pumping in the form of a waveguide, the tip of which is embedded into the maser crystal. Combining experimental measurements with ray-tracing analysis, we find that our approach offers at least a factor of 2 enhancement in the cooperativity over end-on optical excitation.

Motivation: The motivation is to deepen the understanding of monitored quantum systems by reviewing theoretical formalisms and recent developments in their spectral and typical aspects.

Result: The results include insights into the spectral features of dynamical maps and their connection to typical behaviors in quantum trajectories, along with the role of Lyapunov exponents in phase transitions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting the connection between spectral properties of dynamical maps and typical behaviors in quantum trajectories, as well as the role of Lyapunov exponents in indicating measurement-induced phase transitions.

Abstract: Thanks to recent experimental advances in simulating and detecting quantum dynamics with high precision and controllability, our understanding of the physics of monitored quantum systems has considerably deepened over the past decades. In this article, we provide an introductory theoretical review on the basic formalisms governing open quantum dynamics under measurement, along with recent developments in their spectral and typical aspects. After reviewing quantum measurement theory, we introduce the concept of quantum trajectories, which are the conditional dynamics of monitored states shaped by a set of measurement outcomes. We then discuss the spectral properties of the dynamical map describing the evolution averaged over measurement outcomes. As has recently been recognized, these spectral features are intimately connected to whether quantum trajectories exhibit typical behaviors, such as the ergodicity and purification. Moreover, we introduce Lyapunov exponents of typical quantum trajectories and discuss how these quantities serve as indicators of measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum many-body systems.

Conclusion: 本文通过改进广义组合Feynman-Vdovichenko方法，成功降低了转移矩阵的维度，并结合现代计算资源，对Sierpiński地毯SC_k(3,1)的临界温度进行了高精度估计，同时扩展了对SC_k(a,b)系列其他成员的分析。

Abstract: We present a key algorithmic improvement to the generalized combinatorial Feynman--Vdovichenko method for calculating the critical temperature of the Ising model on Sierpiński carpets $SC_k(a,b)$, originally introduced in {\tt arxiv:1505.02699}. By reformulating the method in terms of purely real-valued transfer matrices, we substantially reduce their dimension. This optimization, together with modern computational resources, enables us to reach generation $k=10$ for the canonical $SC_k(3,1)$ carpet. Extrapolation from these data yields the most accurate estimate to date of the critical temperature $T_c^{(3,1)} = 1.4782927(26)$. We further extend the analysis to additional members of the $SC_k(a,b)$ family and report their corresponding critical temperatures.

Motivation: To address the fundamental problem of navigating toward a known target in a noisy environment shared across biological, physical, and engineered systems.

Method: Controlled robotic platform, active Brownian particle simulations, and scaling theory.

Result: Identification of a universal trade-off between noise-induced deviation and the finite cost of reorientation, yielding an optimal course correction frequency governed by only a few system parameters.

Conclusion: Intermittent course-correction is established as a minimal and robust alternative to continuous feedback, offering a unifying guiding principle for point-to-point navigation in complex environments.

Abstract: Navigating toward a known target in a noisy environment is a fundamental problem shared across biological, physical, and engineered systems. Although optimal strategies are often framed in terms of continuous, fine-grained feedback, we show that efficient navigation emerges from a far simpler principle: natural wandering punctuated by intermittent course corrections. Using a controlled robotic platform, active Brownian particle simulations, and scaling theory, we identify a universal trade-off between noise-induced deviation and the finite cost of reorientation, yielding an optimal course correction frequency governed by only a few system parameters. Despite their differing levels of complexity, our experiment and theory collapse onto common quantitative signatures, including first-passage time distribution and non-Gaussian angular dispersion. Our results establish intermittent course-correction as a minimal and robust alternative to continuous feedback, offering a unifying guiding principle for point-to-point navigation in complex environments.

Motivation: To explore the non-equilibrium behavior of a qubit under continuous measurement and feedback by leveraging insights from classical active matter.

Method: The research employs stochastic dynamics analysis and a mapping technique from quantum to classical active matter systems.

Result: An approximate non-equilibrium steady-state distribution is derived, showing a phase with Zeno--anti-Zeno transitions analogous to active particle behavior.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the dynamics of a qubit under continuous measurement and feedback can be mapped to a classical persistent Run-and-Tumble Particle, revealing a rich non-equilibrium steady-state phase with Zeno--anti-Zeno transitions.

Abstract: We investigate the active stochastic dynamics of a qubit subjected to continuous measurement and conditional feedback. The stochastic equation governing the state vector trajectory of the qubit can be mapped, in the high-diffusion limit, to the dynamics of a classical persistent Run-and-Tumble Particle (p-RTP) in a bounded one-dimensional domain. The mapping enables us to use analytical results from classical active matter to derive an approximate non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS) distribution for the monitored quantum system. The competition between the coherent Rabi drive and the measurement-induced feedback leads to a rich NESS phase displaying Zeno--anti-Zeno transition--which is statistically equivalent to the propulsion-induced trapping observed in confined active particles.

Conclusion: 综合来看，研究揭示了一种新的范式，其中多尺度的波函数结构内在生成了长程连接性，为在强关联量子材料中实现非局域行为提供了自然途径。

Abstract: We uncover a generic mechanism through which the intrinsic geometry of multifractal quantum wavefunctions generates effective all-to-all interactions in many-body systems. By analyzing the multifractal spectrum, we demonstrate that the simultaneous participation of widely separated length scales creates a global connectivity that bypasses local interaction constraints. This nonlocality leads to fast information scrambling, evidenced by sharp changes in the quenched dynamics of the quantum Fisher information and bipartite mutual information with the onset of negative tripartite mutual information. Such rapid scrambling is a defining feature of strongly chaotic quantum dynamics, and our results identify the systems with multifractal states as a promising solid-state platform for realizing this regime. More broadly, they reveal a new paradigm in which complex, multiscale wavefunction structure intrinsically generates long-range connectivity, providing a natural route to achieving nonlocal behavior in strongly correlated quantum materials.

Abstract: We identify an unconventional form of the non-Hermitian skin effect that occurs not in position space but in many-body Fock space, which we call the Fock space skin effect (FSSE). Using quantum dimer models, we characterize FSSE analytically and numerically, and propose a concrete route toward its realization in Rydberg atom arrays. The dimer constraint is enforced through Rydberg gadgets employing the blockade mechanism, while directional reservoirs generate non-Hermitian flipping amplitudes. We show that FSSE enables the preparation of gapped spin liquid states, and in particular, we demonstrate how a Rydberg geometry realizing a square lattice quantum dimer model with next-nearest neighbor dimers can be driven by non-Hermiticity into an exact spin liquid ground state. Our results establish Fock-space non-Hermiticity as a powerful principle for engineering exotic quantum phases and dynamical state-preparation protocols.

Motivation: To understand the interplay between Kondo and RKKY physics in a system of magnetic impurities embedded in a band of interacting electrons, particularly in a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid context.

Method: The paper employs bosonization techniques to study a one-dimensional system of independent magnetic impurities in a band of interacting electrons. The model is solved for two special interaction values, allowing refermionization as a non-interacting electron band hybridized with a regular array of resonant levels.

Result: For two special values of interactions, the model can be refermionized, revealing impurity correlators that indicate either extended algebraic order or local screening. The sign of the interaction determines whether Kondo or RKKY physics is stabilized.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into how interelectron interactions influence the stabilization of either Kondo or RKKY physics, depending on the sign of the interaction. The solvable limits offer valuable access to impurity correlators, revealing extended algebraic order or local screening.

Abstract: We address the physics of a regular arrangement of independent magnetic impurities embedded in a band of interacting electrons. We focus on the one-dimensional case that can be studied using bosonization and in which the electron bulk is described by a Luttinger liquid. The impurity spins interact with the electrons via magnetic exchange that introduces the possibility of Kondo and RKKY physics. We find that for two special values of the interactions, the model can be refermionized as a non-interacting electron band hybridized with a regular array of resonant levels. These solvable limits provide access to impurity correlators that correspond to either extended algebraic order or local screening. A physical picture emerges of how the interelectron interactions can stabilize either Kondo or RKKY physics depending on the sign of the interaction.

Motivation: Address the combinatorial computational cost of the exact zero-seniority wave function (DOCI) and the limitations of pair coupled cluster doubles, which fails to provide accurate density matrices in some cases.

Method: Uses the Jordan-Wigner approximation to convert the seniority zero problem into a fermionic problem, achieving DOCI-quality results with polynomial computational cost.

Result: Achieves DOCI-quality variational results for the Hubbard model and small molecular dissociation examples with polynomial cost, including accurate energies and density matrices.

Conclusion: The Jordan-Wigner approximation successfully transforms the seniority zero problem into a fermionic one, enabling variational results of DOCI quality for the Hubbard model and small molecular dissociation examples with polynomial cost, while maintaining accuracy in energy and density matrices.

Abstract: Seniority is a useful way of organizing Hilbert space for strongly correlated systems. The exact zero-seniority wave function, doubly-occupied configuration interaction (DOCI), provides accurate results (given the right orbitals) for many strongly-correlated electronic systems, but has combinatorial computational cost. In many cases, pair coupled cluster doubles provides a polynomial-cost approximation that closely reproduces the energies of DOCI, but it breaks down in some cases and, as shown herein, it does not provide particularly good density matrices. In this work, we demonstrate that by using the Jordan-Wigner approximation to turn the seniority zero problem back into a fermionic one, we can provide variational results of DOCI quality for the Hubbard model and a few small molecular dissociation examples, with polynomial cost, both for the energies and for density matrices, all while being protected from collapse.

Result: The study identified distinct signals in the 2DCS nonlinear response, including diagonal and discrete rephasing signals, which originate from two-spinon and four-spinon excitation processes, highlighting the effectiveness of 2DCS for detecting weak Kitaev interactions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) can effectively detect even weak Kitaev interactions in quantum materials, as evidenced by the identification of signals from two-spinon and four-spinon excitation processes.

Abstract: Detecting Kitaev interactions in real materials remains challenge, as conventional experimental techniques often have difficulty distinguishing fractionalized excitations from other normal contributions. Terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) offers a novel approach for probing many-body phenomena, such as exotic excitations in quantum magnets. Motivated by recent experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and the development of the terahertz spectroscopy in Kitaev quantum spin liquid, we proposed a twisted Kitaev model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and determined the precise twist angle according to experimental specific-heat phase diagram. With this calibrated model, we found that non-rephasing diagonal and rephasing anti-diagonal signals appear in the 2DCS nonlinear response. The $x$ and $y$ components of the spin superexchange interactions split the rephasing signals into a grid of discrete peaks. We further demonstrate that the diagonal and the discrete rephasing signals primarily originate from two-spinon and four-spinon excitation processes based on numerical projection method. These findings indicate that even weak Kitaev interactions in quantum materials can be effectively detected via two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy .

Method: Investigating the topological magnon phases of a 2D Kagome ferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI), analyzing phase diagrams and topological states.

Result: Different interactions introduce distinct topological phase diagrams and states, with multiple high Chern number phases emerging. The interplay controls topological phase transitions, and temperature-induced sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities is observed.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that Kagome magnets with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions (DMI and PDI) exhibit novel topological magnonic properties, serving as a potential platform for magnonic devices and quantum computing.

Abstract: Kagome magnets naturally hosting Dirac points and flat bands exhibit novel topological phases, enabling rich interplays between interactions and topologies. The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets generally coexisting with different types of magnetic interactions poses a challenge for topological magnonic manipulation. Here we investigate the topological magnon phases of 2D Kagome ferromagnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI). It is found that the different sole magnetic anisotropic interactions introduce completely distinct topological phase diagrams and topological states. The multiple topological magnon phases with high Chern number emerge due to the distinct anisotropic interactions. Moreover, the interplay of the multiple anisotropic DMI and PDI interactions involved with Dirac and flat bands controls a variety of topological phase transitions, implying greater manipulation potential. In addition, the sign reversal of thermal Hall and Nernst conductivities induced by temperature is found in particular topological phase regions, namely topological origin, relating to the energy gap and Berry curvature (Chern number) in the vicinity of magnetic phase transition from the thermal fluctuations, providing a possible explanation for the experimental puzzles. All these results demonstrate that the novel topological magnonic properties in Kagome magnet with multiple magnetic anisotropic interactions can realize a potential platform for magnonic devices and quantum computing.

Result: The system hosts a magnetically ordered canted-$120^	ext{°}$ phase and an exact dimer singlet product phase, with a first-order transition at $J_d/J \approx 1.45$. Quantum renormalization of the canting angle is observed.

Conclusion: The spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice exhibits two distinct phases (canted-$120^	ext{°}$ and dimer singlet product) with a first-order transition at $J_d/J \approx 1.45$; quantum effects significantly renormalize the canting angle.

Abstract: We study the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) combined with a corner transfer matrix renormalization group scheme adapted to $C_3$-symmetric lattices. Focusing on the fully antiferromagnetic $J$-$J_d$ model with $J_h = J_t := J$, we map out the ground-state phase diagram as a function of the dimer coupling $J_d$. Our results show that the system hosts only two phases: a magnetically ordered canted-$120^\circ$ phase and an exact dimer singlet product phase. We identify a first-order transition between these two phases at $J_d/J \approx 1.45$. Within the magnetically ordered phase, we observe small but finite magnetic moments. We also resolve the quantum renormalization of the canting angle, which deviates from the classical prediction over almost the entire magnetically ordered phase.

Motivation: To investigate the impact of quantum and thermal phase fluctuations on the suppression of superconducting order in two-dimensional systems.

Method: Extensive path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations within the two-dimensional quantum XY model.

Result: The system exhibits a well-defined critical line and reproduces expected critical behaviors. Stronger interactions lead to a crossover to an insulating regime, with quantum phase fluctuations revealed in conductivity.

Conclusion: The study establishes a clear critical line in the temperature-interaction phase diagram, ending at a quantum critical point, and demonstrates a crossover to an insulating regime for stronger interactions. The frequency-dependent conductivity reveals the role of quantum phase fluctuations.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of quantum and thermal phase fluctuations on the suppression of superconducting order in two-dimensional systems. Within the two-dimensional quantum XY model in the phase representation, where on-site interaction terms govern quantum phase fluctuations, we perform extensive path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting temperature-interaction phase diagram establishes the presence of a well-defined critical line ending at a quantum critical point at vanishing temperature with no indication of reentrant behavior. We further demonstrate that the resistance above the critical line reproduces the two expected different critical behaviors. For stronger interactions, above the quantum critical point, the system exhibits a crossover to an insulating regime at low temperatures. Finally, Monte Carlo calculations of current-current correlation functions enable us to extract the frequency-dependent conductivity in both superconducting and normal regimes, revealing a finite-frequency response that we attribute to quantum phase fluctuations.

TL;DR: The study extends prior work on graphene's shear viscosity under finite magnetic fields, revealing anisotropic effects and identifying key magnetic field strengths for observable changes in viscosity coefficients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend prior work by exploring the anisotropic effects of finite magnetic fields on the shear viscosity of electron fluids in graphene, and to compare the magnetic field responses across different fluid systems.

Method: The research employs kinetic theory within the relaxation time approximation to calculate the shear viscosity coefficients under finite magnetic fields.

Result: The application of a finite magnetic field introduces anisotropy, resulting in five independent shear viscosity coefficients. The perpendicular and parallel components are suppressed at specific conditions, while the Hall effect reaches its maximum. Required magnetic field strengths for noticeable effects are identified for graphene, non-relativistic electron fluid, and ultra-relativistic quark fluid.

Conclusion: The study provides a detailed analysis of shear viscosity coefficients in graphene under finite magnetic fields, highlighting the suppression of perpendicular and parallel components and the enhancement of the Hall effect. It also specifies the magnetic field strengths required for observable effects in different fluid systems.

Abstract: Present article has addressed finite magnetic field extension of previous work by Cho et al. (Phys. Rev. B 108, 235172, 2023) on microscopic calculation of shear viscosity for electron fluid in graphene system. Our calculation is based on the kinetic theory approach in the relaxation time approximation. In the absence of magnetic field, transport is governed by a single shear viscosity coefficient, whereas the application of a finite magnetic field induces anisotropy, give rise to the five independent shear viscosity coefficients associated with distinct velocity gradient tensors. These coefficient can be physically categorized into perpendicular, parallel and Hall components relative to the magnetic field direction. When the scattering time equals to the cyclotron time, the perpendicular component is suppressed by 80% and parallel component by 50%, and Hall effect can reach maximum. Corresponding magnetic field strength for electron fluid in graphene is around 0.01-0.1 Tesla and the same for non-relativistic electron fluid and ultra-relativistic quark fluid are around 10 Tesla and 10^14 Tesla respectively. They may be considered as required magnetic field strength in three different fluid systems to observe noticeable magnetic field response in their shear viscosity coefficients.

Abstract: We propose a ground state entanglement probe for gapped, two-dimensional quantum many-body systems that involves taking powers of reduced density matrices in a particular geometric configuration. This quantity, which we denote by $ω_{α,β}$, is parameterized by two positive real numbers $α, β$, and can be seen as a ``Rényi-like" generalization of the modular commutator -- another entanglement probe proposed as a way to compute the chiral central charge from a bulk wave function. We obtain analytic expressions for $ω_{α,β}$ for gapped ground states of non-interacting fermion Hamiltonians as well as ground states of string-net models. In both cases, we find that $ω_{α,β}$ takes a universal value related to the chiral central charge. For integer values of $α$ and $β$, our quantity $ω_{α,β}$ can be expressed as an expectation value of permutation operators acting on an appropriate replica system, providing a natural route to measuring $ω_{α,β}$ in numerical simulations and potentially, experiments.

Motivation: To investigate the impact of disorder on the Superconductor-Insulator Transition (SIT) in low-dimensional systems, specifically focusing on Josephson arrays with comparable Josephson and charging energies ($E_J\sim E_C$).

Method: A strong randomness real-space renormalization group technique was applied to explore the phase diagram of a two-legged Josephson ladder with spatially distributed parameters and preserved $ℕ2$ symmetry.

Result: Three distinct disorder-dominated phases were identified: a disordered superconductor, an intermediate Bose glass phase, and a disordered insulator, the latter mapping to an XY spin-chain in a spin glass phase.

Conclusion: The study identifies three disorder-dominated phases in a two-legged Josephson ladder model, including an intermediate Bose glass phase between a superconductor and an insulator, enhancing understanding of quantum fluctuations in disordered systems.

Abstract: Disordered superconductors in low dimensions provide an exemplary manifestation for the role of quantum fluctuations in a many-body system. Specifically in Josephson arrays with comparable Josephson and charging energies ($E_J\sim E_C$), disorder tends to change the nature of the paradigmatic Superconductor-Insulator Transition (SIT) and potentially leads to formation of multiple distinct phases. We address this problem in a model of a two-legged Josephson ladder subjected to a wide spatial distribution of its parameters along the legs. In contrast, we assume the system to have a perfect $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry to interchange between the legs, and investigate the effects of spatial randomness which preserves this symmetry in the strong-disorder limit. To this end, we apply a strong randomness real-space renormalization group technique and explore the resulting phase diagram. We identify three disorder-dominated phases, including an intermediate phase between a disordered superconductor and a disordered insulator. The latter insulating phase can be mapped to a XY spin-chain in a spin glass phase, while the intermediate phase turns out to be a Bose glass.

Motivation: To discover high-temperature superconductors among hydrogen-rich compounds, despite their need for extreme stabilization pressures.

Method: Multi-stage high-throughput screening of ternary A15-type hydrides and computational search in the Y-Sb-H system using ephemeral data-derived potentials.

Result: YSbH₆ shows a predicted critical temperature of 118 K at 50 GPa, dynamic stability over 20-120 GPa, and possible metastability at high pressures.

Conclusion: YSbH₆ emerges as a benchmark for balancing high critical temperature with thermodynamic stability in ternary hydrides, emphasizing the need for comprehensive stability analyses in experimental synthesis of metastable superconductors.

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductors remains a central challenge in materials science. Hydrogen-rich compounds are among the most promising candidates, as they can exhibit phonon-mediated superconductivity at elevated critical temperatures, though their stabilization typically requires extreme pressures. %
Here, we report the identification of YSbH$_{6}$ as a promising superconductor by a multi-stage high-throughput screening on ternary A15-type hydrides, followed by a high-throughput computational search of the Y--Sb--H system, accelerated by ephemeral data derived potentials. %
The cubic $Pm\Bar{3}$ YSbH$_{6}$ phase exhibits a predicted critical temperature of 118\,K at 50\,GPa, among the highest $T_{\rm c}$ reported to date for an A15-hydride at this pressure. Thermodynamic analysis shows that YSbH$_{6}$ lies $\sim$100\,meV/atom above the convex hull at 50\,GPa, but only 26\,meV/atom above the hull at 120\,GPa, suggesting possible metastability and synthesis at similar high pressure conditions. The phase is dynamically stable over a wide pressure range (20--120\,GPa), displays kinetic stability at 50\,GPa and elastic stability at 20 and 50\,GPa, key ingredients for long-lived metastable behaviour at moderate pressures. %
These results highlight YSbH$_{6}$ as a benchmark case illustrating the balance between high-$T_{\rm c}$ performance and limited thermodynamic stability in ternary hydrides, and underscore the importance of combined dynamic, thermodynamic, kinetic and elastic stability analyses for guiding experimental synthesis of metastable superconductors.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the intrinsic (impurity-independent) spin Nernst effect (SNE), a spin current generation perpendicular to temperature gradients, in spin-triplet superconductors. We show that, in these systems, the SNE consists of two distinct contributions: a direct quasiparticle contribution and an indirect supercurrent contribution. The quasiparticle contribution originates from the momentum space Berry curvature generated by spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The indirect contribution arises from a compensating supercurrent that cancels the bulk thermoelectric charge current. While this contribution vanishes when the condensate has no spin-polarization in momentum space, it can be comparable in magnitude to the quasiparticle contribution in nonunitary superconductors. These results demonstrate that thermoelectric spin supercurrent must be explicitly accounted for when evaluating the SNE in nonunitary superconductors.

Motivation: The motivation is to identify a new class of superconductors that support Majorana corner modes, distinct from previous works on second-order topological superconductors, and to explore their practical implementation.

Method: The authors introduce a class of superconductors called 'quantized quadrupole superconductors' and use the quadrupole moment as a topological invariant. They analyze two types of mixed pairings in bilayer two-dimensional electron gases with Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

Result: The study demonstrates that the quadrupole phase is robust against relative phase fluctuations in the mixed pairings and disorders, making it a viable platform for Majorana zero modes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed 'quantized quadrupole superconductors' provide a realistic platform for implementing Majorana zero modes, advancing the study of Majorana physics.

Abstract: We introduce a class of superconductors termed "quantized quadrupole superconductors" that support Majorana corner modes according to the bulk-corner correspondence, distinct from previous works on the second-order topological superconductors. An intrinsic physical quantity for superconductors, i.e., the quadrupole moment serves as the topological invariant, which is always half-quantized due to the particle-hole symmetry. As examples, two types of mixed pairings, $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm id_{xy}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\pm is$, induced in the bilayer two-dimensional electron gases with Rashba spin-orbit coupling give the quadrupole phase. Extended discussions indicate that the nontrivial phase is robust against relative phase fluctuations in the mixed pairings and the disorders. Our schemes provide realistic platforms to implement Majorana zero modes, paving the way for studying the Majorana physics.

Abstract: Near a quantum critical point (QCP) in a metal, strong Fermion-Fermion interactions mediated by soft collective bosons give rise to two competing phenomena: non-Fermi liquid behavior and superconductivity that deviates from conventional BCS and Migdal-Eliashberg theories. We consider the problem of obtaining closed-form analytical lower and upper bounds on transition temperatures for such systems. We focus mainly on a class of models known as the gamma-model, which generalizes the Eliashberg theory of Superconductivity where the effective interaction potential scales as V(Omega) ~ 1/|Omega|^gamma. Building on a recent reformulation of Migdal-Eliashberg theory, expressed as a classical infinite spin chain with nonlocal interactions, and employing a simple linear algebra framework, we derive rigorous closed-form expressions for upper and lower bounds on the superconducting transition temperature for any gamma > 0. While our lower bounds coincide precisely with those previously in the literature, our derivation offers a more streamlined and accessible method. Moreover, our upper bounds are substantially tighter than any existing estimates and converge rapidly enough to the numerical results from various prior studies.

Method: The study employs a 3D altermagnetic topological insulator proximitized by an s-wave superconductor, focusing on the properties of BFSs and their interaction with altermagnetic order. Quantum confinement and vortex phase transitions are analyzed to study the emergence of MZMs.

Result: The research identifies highly anisotropic superconducting gaps and BFSs, leading to the realization of MZMs in different configurations (vortex line vs. physical boundaries). It also demonstrates topological phase transitions in quasi-1D nanowires.

Conclusion: The research proposes a new approach to topological superconductivity by utilizing altermagnetic topological insulators and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs). It demonstrates the potential for engineering Majorana zero modes (MZMs) through crystal anisotropy and quantum confinement, opening a new avenue in the field.

Abstract: We propose a novel type of topological superconductivity based on Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in an altermagnetic topological insulator proximitized by an s-wave superconductor. The 3D altermagnetic topological insulator is characterized by zero-energy surface states in bulk nodal-ring phases and anisotropically shifted surface Dirac cones in topological insulating phases. It is potentially realized in \mathrm{EuIn_{2}As_{2}}. The altermagnetic order in combination with superconductivity gives rise to highly anisotropic superconducting gaps with crystal-facet-dependent BFSs at the physical boundaries. These particular BFSs provide distinct platforms to realize Majorana zero modes (MZMs). We propose a quasi-1D nanowire in which the anisotropic BFSs experience topological phase transitions due to quantum confinement leading to MZMs at its ends. We further consider vortex phase transitions in the superconducting altermagnetic topological insulators. Remarkably, we find that the altermagnetic order allows us to transit between two distinct type of MZMs, one type is located at the vortex line, while the other type is located at the physical boundaries. Our work paves a new avenue utilizing altermagnetism-induced BFSs to engineer topological superconductivity through crystal anisotropy and quantum confinement.

Motivation: The study aims to explore whether abrupt, hysteretic phase transitions, typically observed in interdependent superconducting networks, can also arise in single-layer systems with dual interactions.

Method: Experimental and simulation methods were used to study a single-network superconducting system with short-range electrical connectivity and long-range thermal dependency.

Result: The system undergoes a mixed-order phase transition marked by discontinuous resistance changes and critical scaling behavior, driven by heat flow. Long-lived transient states and scaling dynamics near the critical point were observed.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that complex critical phenomena like mixed-order transitions, previously thought to require interdependent systems, can also occur in single-layer systems with dual interactions. Results open new avenues for designing and controlling phase changes in various systems.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that introducing dependency interactions between two superconducting networks can trigger abrupt, hysteretic normal-superconductor phase transitions. In this study, we demonstrate that such behavior can also arise in a single-network superconducting system that features two distinct types of interactions: short-range electrical connectivity and long-range thermal dependency. Using experimental and simulation methods, we show that when sufficient heat is dissipated within a single-layer disordered superconducting network, the system undergoes a mixed-order phase transition marked by both a discontinuous change in resistance and critical scaling behavior. We find that the emergence and characteristics of these abrupt transitions depend critically on the thermal conductivity of the underlying substrate, establishing heat flow as the origin of the unique phase transition. Additionally, both experimental and numerical results reveal long-lived transient states and scaling dynamics near the critical point, consistent with spontaneous branching processes observed in interdependent networks theory. These findings strongly demonstrate that complex critical phenomena, such as mixed-order transitions, previously attributed to structurally interdependent systems, can also arise within single-layer physical systems when dual interactions coexist. Our results broaden the scope of the theory and experiments of phase transitions in interdependent networks and suggest new ways to design and control phase changes in physical, biological, and technological systems where two interactions are present.

Abstract: In strongly correlated superconductors, the emergence of superconductivity is often accompanied by anomalous normal state. The connection between these two phenomena is considered crucial for understanding the underlying unconventional pairing mechanisms. In this study, we report analogous behavior in MoS2, a band insulator devoid of long-range magnetic order. Through ionic liquid gating, continuous doping control from the underdoped to the overdoped regime was achieved, revealing a symmetric superconducting dome that holds characteristic scaling relations mirror the behavior of strongly correlated superconductors. Strikingly, this system exhibits pronounced non-Fermi liquid transport near optimal doping, characterized by a quasi-linear temperature dependence of resistivity over a wide range and a T2-dependent Hall angle cotangent. The strength of the non-Fermi liquid transport is positively correlated with the superconducting transition temperature, with both evolving synchronously across the phase diagram. These results highlight the potential of MoS2 as an ideal platform for studying the intrinsic connection between non-Fermi liquid transport and superconductivity.

Motivation: To systematically explore the vast compositional space of ternary hydrides for high-temperature superconductivity, leveraging machine learning to overcome the challenges of traditional experimental methods.

Method: An ensemble of 30 XGBoost regression models was trained on a curated dataset of ~2000 binary and ternary hydrides to screen A-B-H compositions at pressures of 100, 200, and 300 GPa. Feature-importance analysis was conducted to understand key elemental properties influencing superconducting transition temperature.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble-based machine learning in identifying promising ternary hydrides for superconductivity, highlighting its potential as a primary screening tool in materials science.

Abstract: We present an ensemble machine-learning approach for composition-based, structure-agnostic screening of candidate superconductors among ternary hydrides under high pressure. Hydrogen-rich hydrides are known to exhibit high superconducting transition temperatures, and ternary or multinary hydrides can stabilize superconducting phases at reduced pressures through chemical compression. To systematically explore this vast compositional space, we construct an ensemble of 30 XGBoost regression models trained on a curated dataset of approximately 2000 binary and ternary hydride entries. The model ensemble is used to screen a broad set of A-B-H compositions at pressures of 100, 200, and 300 GPa, with screening outcomes evaluated statistically based on prediction consistency across ensemble members. This analysis highlights several high-scoring compositional systems, including Ca-Ti-H, Li-K-H, and Na-Mg-H, which were not explicitly included in the training dataset. In addition, feature-importance analysis indicates that elemental properties such as ionization energy and atomic radius contribute significantly to the learned composition-level trends in superconducting transition temperature. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of ensemble-based machine learning as a primary screening tool for identifying promising regions of chemical space in superconducting hydrides.

Motivation: To explore how different under-layers affect charge carrier substitution and superconducting transition temperature (TC) in Ti40V60 alloy thin films.

Method: Studying the influence of metallic and semiconducting under-layers (V, Al, Si) on the superconducting properties of Ti40V60 alloy thin films, including Hall measurements to analyze charge carrier effects.

Result: Superconducting transition temperature (TC) tunable between 4.77 K and 5.73 K; Si under-layer introduces highest disorder but yields highest TC, while increasing carrier concentration correlates with decreasing TC.

Conclusion: Under-layer engineering effectively tunes the superconducting properties of Ti-V alloy thin films, with moderate disorder suppressing spin-fluctuations and enhancing superconductivity.

Abstract: The influence of metallic and semiconducting (V, Al, and Si) under-layer induced charge carrier substitution on the superconducting properties of the Ti40V60 alloy thin films are studied and also compared with a pristine reference film without any under-layer. All the films exhibit metallic behavior in the normal state and a superconducting transition at low temperatures, where the superconducting transition temperature is tunable between 4.77 K and 5.73 K. Hall measurements on the films reveal that the under-layer strongly affects the charge carrier type and density, leading to a correlation between increasing carrier concentration and decreasing TC. The Si under-layer introduces the highest disorder yet yields the highest TC, indicating that in the Ti40V60 alloys, moderate disorder suppresses the spin-fluctuations induced pair breaking, thereby enhancing the superconductivity. The comparable TC of the V under-layer and pristine films without under-layer, along with a coherence length (~6.2 nm) much smaller than the film thickness (25 nm), confirms the absence of any significant proximity effects. These findings demonstrate that under-layer engineering provides an effective route to tune the superconducting properties of Ti-V alloy thin films.

Abstract: A series of experiments revealed that novel bipartite magnetic and superconducting (SC) phases widely exist in the phase diagrams of iron pnictides and chalcogenides. Nevertheless, the origin of the two-dome magnetic and SC phases in iron-based compounds remains unclear. Here we theoretically investigated the electronic structures, magnetic and SC properties of three representative iron-based systems, i.e. LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$H$_{x}$, LaFeAs$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$O and KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$. We propose a unified quasi-degenerate orbital mechanism for the emergence of the two-dome parent magnetic/structural phase and the subsequent two-dome SC phase. It is found that the degenerate in-plane anisotropic $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals dominate the first magnetic/structural and SC phases, while in-plane isotropic orbitals $d_{xy}$ or $d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$ with quasi-degeneracy originating from quasi-symmetry drive the emergence of the second magnetic/SC dome phase. Moreover, a matching rule of spin and orbital modes for SC pairing state is proposed in multi-orbital iron-based systems. These results imply an orbital-driven mechanism as well as an orbital-selective scenario, and shed light on the understanding of the multi-dome magnetic and SC phases in multi-orbital systems.

Motivation: To understand the interaction between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in EuFe(As1-xPx)2.

Method: Using a composite magnetoelectric technique to map phase diagrams.

Result: For Tc<TFM, ferromagnetic multi-domain states suppress Hc2 and Hirr. For Tc>TFM, short-range spin correlations suppress Hc2.

Conclusion: The study resolves the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in EuFe(As1-xPx)2, highlighting the suppression of Hc2 and Hirr due to domain states and spin correlations.

Abstract: Using ac composite magnetoelectric technique, we map the phase diagrams of EuFe(As1-xPx)2 to resolve the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. For samples with Tc<TFM, the transition to a ferromagnetic multi-domain state suppresses Hc2 through the breakdown of Jaccarino-Peter compensation and enhanced magnetic scattering from inter-domain disorder, while Hirr is reduced due to vortex-antivortex pair nucleation at domain walls disrupting the vortex lattice. Conversely, for samples with Tc>TFM, strong short-range spin correlations and phase boundaries within a multiphase coexistence regime near the triple point act as potent pair-breaking centers, leading to pronounced Hc2 suppression.

Abstract: In a recent experiment [Nature 642, 58 (2025)], a new record for the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ among infinite-layer nickelates has been reported in doped SmNiO$_2$. Here, we use the cutting-edge dynamical vertex approximation (D$Γ$A), and qualitatively as well as quantitatively reproduce the $T_c$ vs. doping dome for this compound. Encouraged by this, we go further and identify a path towards realizing even higher $T_c$'s by changing the cation along the line Nd$\rightarrow$Sm$\rightarrow$Y$\rightarrow$Lu with matching substrates. The successively smaller cation radius allows for smaller lattice constants of the substrate. This in turn increases the in-plane hopping and thus eventually $T_c$.

Conclusion: 该论文通过对比铜酸盐和pnictides中金属和配体轨道的化学和物理作用，提出了一种统一的超导机制模型，同时解释了铜酸盐中的静态局域无序现象。

Abstract: Murunskite K$_2$Cu$_3$FeS$_4$ is a representative sulfosalt, isostructural to the pnictides, but with electronic properties more similar to the insulating parent compounds of the cuprates. We use it as a bridge to compare the chemical and physical roles of metal and ligand orbitals in cuprates and pnictides.
  In cuprates, ionicity, covalency, and metallicity are tightly interwoven to give rise to high-temperature superconductivity (SC). Their most remarkable property is the interaction of an ionically localized hole on the copper (Cu) with a Fermi liquid (FL) on the oxygens (O), which is critically important for understanding all key properties of these materials. The localization is due to strong correlations on the Cu $3d$ orbital. We describe a scenario in which the localized hole gives rise both to SC by Cooper scattering of O holes, and to Fermi arcs, as observed in cuprate spectroscopy, the latter by a purely kinematic projection of the static local disorder, without invoking any residual interactions between the mobile O FL carriers.
  In the pnictides, the orbitals responsible for binding and metallic conduction appear to be separate. The Fe $3d$ $e_{g}$ orbitals hybridized with the ligands set the lattice spacing. The $3d$ $t_{2g}$ orbitals overlap directly between the Fe atoms, resulting in several electronic bands appearing at the Fermi level. The ensuing Fermi liquid exhibits both charge and magnetic correlations. We argue that a similar SC scenario as in the cuprates is plausible in the pnictides, except that a light FL scatters on a slow nearly-antiferromagnetic (AF) one, rather than on localized holes as in the cuprates.

Abstract: We develop theoretical methods to predict the effects of paramagnetic impurities on the microwave response of conventional spin-singlet superconductors. Our focus is on superconducting devices and resonators with low concentrations of impurities and exchange interactions with conduction electrons. We connect the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum generated by pair-breaking to the frequency and temperature dependence of the conductivity for superconductors operating at microwave frequencies. We report theoretical results for superconducting device performance -- dissipation, quality factor and frequency shift anomalies -- based on self-consistent calculations of the current response and penetraion of the electromagnetic field at the vacuum-superconducting interface. Key results include the prediction of a non-monotonic anomaly in the low-frequency superfluid fraction and penetration depth at very low temperatures related to the sub-gap quasiparticle spectrum. Dissipation of microwave power is predicted from intra- and inter- impurity band transitions at GHz frequencies at low temperatures, including a physical mechanism responsible for residual resistance. We predict anomalies in the resonant frequency, $f(T)$, and quality factor, $Q(T)$, of high-Q SRF cavities operating in the GHz range at low-temperatures that are sensitive to non-magnetic and paramagnetic impurity disorder.

Motivation: The study aims to achieve full electrical control of electron Loss-DiVincenzo (LD) spin qubits, addressing challenges in scalability and fast spin manipulation.

Method: Realistic device modeling and numerical simulations were used to study a vertical DQD in a Si/SiGe/Si heterostructure, focusing on spin-orbit interaction and strain effects.

Result: The DQD exhibits significant g tensor variations and large valley splitting (~250 μeV), enabling EDSR, electrically controlled ESR, and ultrafast single qubit gates (<1 ns).

Conclusion: The DQD architecture eliminates the need for micromagnets, enhancing scalability and enabling fast electrical single qubit rotations.

Abstract: We study a vertical double quantum dot (DQD) in a Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$/Si double-well heterostructure for full electrical control of electron Loss-DiVincenzo (LD) spin qubits, using realistic device modeling and numerical simulations. Due to the emerging spin-orbit interaction in the DQD, as well as strain from the gate electrodes, small (percentage range) but finite $g$ tensor variations emerge. In addition, we find a large valley splitting, on the order of $E_v{\sim}250\,μ$eV. As a result, multiple avenues for fast electrical single qubit rotations emerge. An ac electric field gives rise to electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR), while electron spin resonance (ESR) in the presence of an ac magnetic field can be electrically controlled by local gates due to varying $g$ factors in DQDs. We also show that shuttling between neighboring dots, in vertical and horizontal direction, results in ultrafast single qubit gates of less than a nanosecond. Remarkably, this DQD architecture completely eliminates the need for micromagnets, significantly facilitating the scalability of LD spin qubits in semiconductor foundries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of superconducting resonators integrated with Ge quantum wells, particularly the issue of photon losses, and to explore the potential of hybrid quantum devices using improved heterostructure architectures.

Method: The research involved the fabrication and characterization of microwave resonators patterned in an Al thin film of an in-situ grown superconductor/semiconductor hybrid heterostructure, with the semiconductor part grown on a commercial Ge substrate. The kinetic inductance and superconducting gap of the Al film were extracted, and the magnetic field dependence was studied.

Result: Internal quality factors (Qi) exceeding 1000 were consistently achieved, with a record Qi ≈ 49000 at single-photon occupation and a plateau of Qi ≈ 20000 at sub-one photon. The resonators remained well-defined up to in-plane magnetic fields of 850 mT, and a hysteresis in the out-of-plane magnetic field dependence was observed.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates significant advancements in the fabrication and performance of superconducting resonators integrated with Ge quantum wells, achieving record-high internal quality factors and robust performance under high magnetic fields.

Abstract: Superconducting resonators integrated with Ge quantum wells (QWs) offer a promising platform for hybrid quantum devices. Yet, in the most common heterostructure architectures, they have so far been limited by sizable photon losses. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of microwave resonators patterned in the Al thin film of an in-situ grown superconductor/semiconductor hybrid heterostructure (HS). The semiconductor part of this hybrid HS is grown on a commercial Ge substrate. We consistently achieve internal quality factors $Q_i>1000$, surpassing previous results on Ge QW heterostructures grown using the concept of a virtual Ge substrate on Si substrates. We reach $Q_i \approx 49000$ at single-photon occupation and a plateau of $Q_i \approx 20000$ at sub-one photon, an order of magnitude larger than any previously reported value of resonators on Ge QW structures at low power. We further characterize the thin Al film forming the resonator, extracting its kinetic inductance and superconducting gap, and studying its magnetic field dependence. Notably, the resonance remains well-defined up to in-plane magnetic fields of 850 mT. A hysteresis emerges in the out-of-plane magnetic field dependence, for both the resonance frequency and the quality factor, indicating an interesting interplay between vortex- and quasiparticle loss mechanisms.

TL;DR: Study of nuclear spin dynamics in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells reveals large Overhauser fields and low nuclear spin temperatures, confirming spin temperature theory and observing self-polarization at millikelvin scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the dynamic polarization of nuclear spins in a quantum well and understand the behavior of nuclear spin systems under extreme conditions, such as low temperatures and high magnetic fields.

Method: Time-resolved Kerr rotation and optical orientation measurements of photoluminescence are used to study dynamic polarization of nuclear spins in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well. Experiments are conducted at temperatures ranging from 1.6 K down to 300 mK.

Result: A remarkably large Overhauser field of 3.1 T is measured at 1.6 K, with a nuclear spin temperature of 6.4 μK. At lower temperatures (500 mK and 300 mK), dynamic self-polarization of nuclear spins is observed, with a nuclear spin temperature as low as 200 nK.

Conclusion: The nuclear spin system in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well follows spin temperature theory despite quadrupole-induced splitting. Dynamic self-polarization of nuclear spins is observed at millikelvin temperatures, with extremely low nuclear spin temperatures (as low as 200 nK).

Abstract: We investigate the dynamic polarization of nuclear spins in a nominally undoped GaAs/Al$_{0.35}$Ga$_{0.65}$As quantum well using two complementary experimental approaches: time-resolved Kerr rotation and optical orientation measurements of photoluminescence. Using the first technique, we measure a remarkably large Overhauser field of 3.1 T in a geometry close to the Faraday configuration for a 19.7 nm wide quantum well at a temperature of 1.6 K. A nuclear spin temperature of 6.4 $μ$K is measured at an external magnetic field of 0.006 T following an adiabatic sweep from 0.6 T. Despite the quadrupole-induced nuclear spin splitting inherent to nanostructures, the nuclear spin system is found to follow the predictions of spin temperature theory. Using the optical orientation of the photoluminescence, we investigated nuclear spin dynamics at millikelvin temperatures down to 300 mK. At a temperature of 500 mK, an Overhauser field of 160 mT is generated in an oblique but nearly Voigt magnetic field using low optical power to avoid heating. The nuclear polarization build-up time is of 150 s, consistent with earlier reports at higher temperatures, where hyperfine scattering on free photoexcited electrons governs relaxation. At 500 mK, the onset of dynamic self-polarization of nuclear spins is observed, which becomes more pronounced as the lattice temperature is further reduced to 300 mK. The estimated nuclear spin temperature in the dynamic self-polarization regime can be as low as 200 nK.

Motivation: To investigate the structural and electronic properties of Sn intercalated buffer layers on SiC(0001) and their effects on graphene formation.

Method: Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (LT-STM/STS), spot-profile analysis low-energy electron diffraction (SPA-LEED), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed.

Result: Sn intercalation forms quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene but introduces local distortions, leading to the coexistence of conventional and Kekule-ordered graphene domains. Strain in the Sn monolayer drives Kekule distortions and electronic band-gap opening.

Conclusion: The study highlights the impact of Sn intercalation on the structural and electronic properties of graphene, revealing the challenges in achieving homogeneous domains and the importance of strain in tuning these properties.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural and electronic properties of Sn intercalated buffer layers on SiC(0001) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (LT-STM/STS), spot-profile analysis low-energy electron diffraction (SPA-LEED), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Sn intercalation effectively decouples the buffer layer, yielding quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) while introducing local lattice distortions. Bias-dependent STM imaging revealed the coexistence of conventional and Kekule-ordered graphene domains, governed by the underlying Sn(1x1) reconstruction at the SiC interface. The measured STS spectra exhibit good agreement with DFT results. However, achieving homogeneous Sn(1x1) domains remains challenging, apparently, due to strain within the Sn monolayer, which drives the emergence of Kekule distortions and the associated electronic band-gap opening omogeneously in graphene. These findings highlight the crucial role of intercalant homogeneity and strain in tuning graphene`s structural and electronic properties.

Motivation: The research aims to explore the tunable correlated physics in graphitic materials, particularly focusing on the flat bands and topological properties of rhombohedral graphite with twist stacking faults.

Method: The authors employed continuum models and realistic tight-binding models to analyze the effects of twist angles on interface states and the topological properties of rhombohedral graphite with twist stacking faults.

Result: The study shows that twist angles can tune interface states, leading to nearly flat bands throughout the moiré Brillouin zone, and reveals a relationship between disorder strength and the Chern number in twisted rhombohedral graphite.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the ability to tune interface states and Chern numbers in twisted rhombohedral graphite through twist angles and disorder strength, highlighting its potential for correlated physics applications.

Abstract: Flat bands in graphitic materials emerged as a platform for realizing tunable correlated physics. As a nodal-line semimetal, rhombohedral graphite features flat drumhead surface states in the vicinity of the Dirac points, which carry a nontrivial topological charge. We present a comprehensive study on rhombohedral graphite with twist stacking faults. Using both the continuum models and the realistic tight-binding models, we show that the twist angle between the graphene layers can tune the interface states at such stacking faults. The evolution of interface states originates from the interplay between the moiré periodicity and Zak phase topology, predicting the occurrence of nearly flat bands throughout the moiré Brillouin zone. We further investigate the disorder-induced layer polarization and tunable Chern number for flat band, and characterize the relationship between the disorder strength and Chern number in twisted rhombohedral graphite.

Motivation: To explore the coupling of moiré spin textures to optical excitations (magneto-moiré excitons), which remains unexplored despite advancements in moiré magnetism research.

Method: The study employed twisted bilayer CrSBr to observe magneto-moiré excitons, correlated with moiré spin textures emerging below a critical twist angle of ~2°. First-principles calculations were used to analyze the results.

Result: The observation of magneto-moiré excitons in twisted bilayer CrSBr revealed distinct signatures in the optical spectrum, arising from one-dimensional spin textures governed by exchange interactions and domain wall energy.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that moiré magnetism can be used to engineer nanoscale excitonic energy landscapes, providing a new platform for magneto-optical sensing, quantum transduction, and control of non-collinear magnetism and topology through light.

Abstract: Moiré superlattices in van der Waals materials have revolutionized the study of electronic and excitonic systems by creating periodic electrostatic potentials. Extending this concept to magnetic materials promises new pathways in merging spintronics with photonics. While moiré magnetism has been revealed with near-field probes and nonlinear optical techniques, the coupling of these magnetic textures to optical excitations - magneto-moiré excitons - remains unexplored. Here, we report the observation of magneto-moiré excitons in twisted bilayer CrSBr, correlated with moiré spin textures that emerge below a critical twist angle of ~2°. The nanoscale moiré spin texture imprints distinct signatures onto the optical spectrum, shifting the exciton energy via a periodic magnetic exchange field. First-principles calculations corroborate that these signatures arise from one-dimensional spin textures governed by the balance of exchange interactions and domain wall energy. Our results demonstrate that moiré magnetism can be used to engineer nanoscale excitonic energy landscapes, providing a new platform for magneto-optical sensing, quantum transduction, and control of non-collinear magnetism and topology through light.

Result: Temperature-induced activation of spin-independent hopping accelerates electron spin relaxation in quantum wells, differing from the motional narrowing effect in bulk CdTe.

Conclusion: The study identifies a unique regime of electron spin dynamics in CdTe/CdMgTe quantum wells, contrasting with bulk CdTe, and provides a method to estimate donor concentration in unintentionally doped structures.

Abstract: The spin dynamics of localized electrons in bulk semiconductors is governed by the interplay of effective nuclear field fluctuations, spin exchange between electrons, and spin transitions into the conduction band. Using spin noise spectroscopy, we reveal this interplay for donor-bound electrons in a CdTe/CdMgTe quantum well and spectrally separate electron spin relaxation and dephasing in zero magnetic field. We identify a specific regime of the electron spin dynamics, where temperature-induced activation of spin-independent hopping leads to a monotonic acceleration of electron spin relaxation. This behavior contrasts with bulk CdTe crystals, where the motional narrowing effect is observed. We attribute this difference to the significantly larger inhomogeneous broadening of the donor-related trion resonance in our quantum well compared to bulk samples. The theoretical analysis of the spin noise power and the strength of the spin exchange interaction provides the estimation of the donor concentration in our unintentionally doped structure.

Result: The discovery of nematic zigzag states and magnon-dressed excitons, with strain-dependent emission lines indicating strong localization of the excitons.

Conclusion: The study reveals the unique properties of magnon-dressed excitons in suspended NiPS3 membranes and highlights their strain-dependent behavior.

Abstract: Layered magnetic and strongly correlated materials present a rich platform for condensed matter physics with intrinsic properties intertwined by magnetism and low-dimensionality. A suspended light-emitting 2D antiferromagnetic membrane forms a highly controllable hybrid system in which the interplay between spin ordering, optical and mechanical degrees of freedom can be uniquely explored. NiPS$_3$ hosts excitons responsible for a puzzling luminescence down to a few atomic layers, linked to its zigzag antiferromagnetic order. The nature of these excitons remains unclear. Here we report on the magnetic excitons of a suspended few-layer NiPS$_3$ membrane. We reveal nematic zigzag states and study the optical transitions induced by the magnon-mediated motion of the excitation in the magnetic lattice, resulting in magnon-dressed excitons. We observe a strain tuning of these emission lines, dependent on their microscopic origin, with rates that sign a strong localization of the magnetic excitons, fading with the number of magnon-mediated hops.

TL;DR: Charge value in transport mechanisms disrupts quantum TURs; a modified TUR is introduced to address violations caused by multi-charge processes like Andreev reflections.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that existing quantum TURs can be violated by transport processes involving multiple charges, such as Andreev reflection processes, highlighting a gap in current theoretical frameworks.

Method: The research employs full counting statistics within the framework of quantum transport to analyze the impact of charge value on TURs. It uses analytical considerations based on non-interacting electronic transport described by scattering formalism.

Result: The results show that the quantum TUR can only be violated if the charge value of the highest charge transport process exceeds the value incorporated in the modified TUR. The violations are solely attributed to the charge value of these processes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the validity of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) is significantly affected by the charge value of transport mechanisms, with violations arising from processes carrying more than one charge. A modified quantum TUR is proposed to account for this charge dependence.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the charge value of transport mechanisms heavily impacts the validity of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). Specifically, we show within the framework of full counting statistics, that the recently established quantum TUR can be violated by the presence of transport processes that carry more than one charge, like Andreev reflection processes in normal metal-superconductor junctions. We propose a modified quantum TUR, which incorporates the charge value and demonstrate that this charge-dependent quantum TUR can only be violated if the highest charge transport process exceeds this charge value. In particular, we establish that the breaking of the quantum TUR solely originates from the charge value of the highest charge transport process. Namely, our analytical considerations do not invoke the existence of superconductivity, and these considerations generally hold for non-interacting electronic transport which can be described by the scattering formalism.

TL;DR: QMC study reveals significant effects of strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone on plasmons in graphene, altering transport theory predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free-standing graphene beyond the Dirac-cone approximation and perturbation theory, especially the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections.

Method: Unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations.

Result: Confirmation of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the Γ point, their dispersion, and quasiparticle residue dependence on momentum, with substantial differences from RPA calculations.

Conclusion: Our findings highlight the need to account for strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene.

Abstract: Transport properties of strongly correlated materials have contributions from quasiparticle excitations such as electrons and holes as well as emerging collective excitations such as sounds and plasmons which are sustained by interactions. It was previously shown in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 205127] that thermal excitation of the long-lived plasmons in graphene provides a substantial contribution to heat and momentum transport in the interaction-dominated regime. Detailed information on these excitations is therefore necessary for the understanding of hydrodynamic transport with quantitative precision. On the other hand, dynamics of graphene plasmons is usually studied using the perturbation theory within the Dirac-cone approximation, thus neglecting the effects of a finite Brillouin zone and higher-order perturbative corrections. Both these effects can be however significant for strong-interacting systems including free-standing graphene where the effective coupling constant can reach values up to two. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the behavior of plasmons in half-filled free standing graphene using unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. We confirm the existence of well-defined resonance peaks for plasmons around the $Γ$ point, report their dispersion and the dependence of their quasiparticle residue on momentum. Comparison with the Random-phase-approximation (RPA) calculation for the Dirac theory shows that strong interactions and finite Brillouin zone effects, automatically taken into account in QMC calculations substantially alter the results. Our findings highlight the need to account for these effects analytically when developing theories of electronic transport in free-standing graphene.
