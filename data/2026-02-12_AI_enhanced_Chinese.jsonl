Extending such self-duality symmetries beyond gauging of abelian groups in tensor-product Hilbert spaces has, however, remained challenging. In this work, we construct a generalized 1+1d Ising model based on a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra $H$ that enjoys an anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry $\\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. We provide an intuitive diagrammatic formulation of both the Hamiltonian and the symmetry operators using a non-(co)commutative generalization of ZX-calculus built from Hopf-algebraic data. When $H$ is self-dual, we further construct a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality operator that exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and becomes a non-invertible symmetry at the self-dual point. This enlarged symmetry mixes with lattice translation and, in the infrared, flows to a weakly integral fusion category given by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of $\\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. Specializing to the Kac-Paljutkin algebra $H_8$, the smallest self-dual Hopf algebra beyond abelian group algebras, we numerically study the phase diagram and identify four of the six $\\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases, separated by Ising critical lines and meeting at a multicritical point.

We show that the twist of boundary conditions in the chains maps onto the transverse momentum of the electric field string, and their Drude weight to the inverse of the string mass per unit length. We numerically determine the phase diagrams for these spin chains, employing DMRG simulations and find global similarities but also many interesting new features in comparison to the full 2D problems. For example, the spin-1 chain we obtain features a continuous family of degenerate ground states at its RK point analogous to a Bloch sphere, but without an underlying microscopic global $SU(2)$ symmetry.

This study is based on an exact mapping of the Anderson model to one of a superconducting pairing layer connected to a metallic reservoir which is valid in arbitrary spatial dimensions, thereby linking the previously disparate areas of reservoir-enhanced superconductivity, following Kivelson's pioneering proposals, and that of periodic Kondo-systems.

These results translate directly to the appearance of near-long-range magnetic order at intermediate scales in the Kondo-systems, and explain the strong renormalization of the RKKY-coupling that we effectively observe, in terms of the back-action of the pairing layer onto the metallic layer.

The difference in dimensionality of the dynamics arises from the electrodynamic field-interference nature of optical binding vs. quantum mechanical bonding in polyatomic molecules. The 8-nanoparticle OM \"kite\" structure we study in experiments and simulations has D2 (D2h) symmetry and a D4 symmetric transition state. The mechanism for pseudorotation involves correlated motion of all 8 nanoparticles with smooth (continuous) evolution of their interactions and without particles jumping in or out of the OM array. While the OM kite structure only occurs with 10% probability vs. other OM isomers, its rate of pseudorotation is rapid relative to transitions to other structural isomers (e.g., \"teardrop\"). The other isomers have structures that lie on a trigonal lattice with inter-particle separations at distances that enhance field interference and induced polarizations. Even though the kite isomer has inter-particle separations that would manifest destructive interference on a particle pair (i.e., 2-body) basis, the kite structure is the slowest to rearrange into any other isomer.

In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $\u0398((\\varepsilon \u03b2)^{-2})$, where $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $\u03b2$ is the accuracy tolerance. We conclude by initiating the study of private classical shadows, which promise useful applications for private learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using first-principles density-functional theory, we quantify its response to isotropic strain spanning strong compression and tensile regimes (effective hydrostatic pressures of approximately $-80$ to $180$~GPa). The coexistence of doubly degenerate $e_g$ and $e_u$ levels produces a structural instability captured by a quadratic product Jahn--Teller model. Under isotropic compression, the zero-phonon line blue-shifts nearly linearly while the $E_g$ phonon stiffens, suppressing vibronic instabilities and reducing Jahn--Teller quenching. Consequently, the Ham-reduced excited-state spin--orbit splitting increases substantially and the dark--bright vibronic gap widens. In contrast, isotropic tensile strain enhances vibronic effects and induces symmetry breaking beyond a critical strain, with tunneling-mediated dynamical averaging at the onset. Throughout the symmetry-preserving regime, parity remains well defined, so isotropic strain alone does not activate the dark transition. Charge-transition levels indicate photostability of the emission deep into the compressive regime, and near the highest photostable deformation ($\\sim 100$~GPa), the radiative lifetime increases due to a reduced transition dipole moment despite the increasing optical energy.

It has remained an open question, however, whether encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise and thus practical as a quantum primitive. This is nontrivial because spreading quantum information widely could dilute it until barely exceeding the noise level, leading to catastrophic fidelity decay. Given the complexity of hardware noise, theory and classical simulation are insufficient to settle this. Here, we settle this question experimentally, on IBM Heron-R2 superconducting processors using up to 154 qubits. We find that encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise, even when used as a module, namely in parallel, series or interleaved, while preserving pre-existing entanglement. This establishes it as a versatile quantum primitive for practical use, and it necessitates a refinement to our understanding of the no-cloning theorem: quantum information can be spread at will, in theory and in practice, without dilution or degradation, if encrypted or obscured.

This challenge has been addressed through device-focused approaches that aim to increase nonlinear interactions relative to decoherence rates. In this work, we adopt a complementary architecture-focused approach by proposing a recirculating quantum photonic network (RQPN) that minimizes the duration of quantum information processing tasks, thereby reducing the requirements on nonlinear interaction rates. The RQPN consists of a network of all-to-all connected nonlinear cavities with dynamically controlled waveguide couplings, and it processes information by capturing a photonic input state, recirculating photons between the cavities, and releasing a photonic output state. We demonstrate the RQPN's architectural advantage through two examples: first, we show that processing all qubits simultaneously yields faster operations than single- and two-qubit decompositions of the three-qubit Toffoli gate. Second, we demonstrate implementations of a measurement-free correction for single-photon loss, achieving up to seven-fold speedups and significantly improved hardware efficiency relative to state-of-the-art architecture proposals. Our work shows that a single hardware-efficient recirculating architecture substantially reduces the temporal overhead of multi-qubit gates and quantum error correction, thereby lowering the barrier to experimental realizations of deterministic photonic quantum information processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While recent works have further proven the universality of a (slightly generalized) model, the next immediate question pertains to its trainability, i.e., whether it suffers from the exponentially vanishing loss gradients, known as the barren plateau issue, preventing effective use, and how regimes of trainability overlap with regimes of possible quantum advantage. Here, we provide significant strides in these directions. To study the trainability at initialization, we analytically derive closed-form expressions for the variances of the partial derivatives of the MMD loss function and provide general upper and lower bounds. With uniform initialization, we show that barren plateaus depend on the generator set and the spectrum of the chosen kernel. We identify regimes in which low-weight-biased kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression in structured topologies. Also, we prove that a small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial scaling for the gradient under mild conditions. As for the potential quantum advantage, we further argue, based on previous complexity-theoretic arguments, that sparse IQP families can output a probability distribution family that is classically intractable, and that this distribution remains trainable at initialization at least at lower-weight frequencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Temporal fluctuations of energy relaxation in these qubits are widely attributed to microscopic two-level systems (TLSs) in device dielectrics and interfaces, yet isolating individual defects typically relies on tuning the qubit or the TLS into resonance. We demonstrate a novel spectroscopy method for fixed-frequency transmons based on multilevel relaxation: repeated preparation of the second excited state and simultaneous $T_1$ extraction of the first and second excited states reveals characteristic correlations in the decay rates of adjacent transitions. From these correlations we identify one or more dominant TLSs and reconstruct their frequency drift over time. Remarkably, we find that TLSs detuned by $\\gtrsim 100\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ from the qubit transition can still significantly influence relaxation. The proposed method provides a powerful tool for TLS spectroscopy without the need to tune the transmon frequency, either via a flux-tunable inductor or AC-Stark shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
