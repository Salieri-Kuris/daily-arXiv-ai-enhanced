To overcome this challenge, implementing three-dimensional (3D) vertical architectures becomes crucial. Niobium (Nb), due to its excellent superconducting characteristics and strong fabrication process compatibility, stands out as a prime material choice. The main challenge in Nb-Nb bonding is the presence of an oxide layer at the interface, even after post-bonding annealing across various bonding methods. The native Nb oxide forms rapidly in air, creating a resistive barrier to supercurrent flow and introducing two-level system losses that degrade qubit coherence while increasing the overall thermal budget. These issues show the need for effective surface engineering to suppress oxidation during bonding. This study introduces an ultrathin gold (Au) capping layer as a passivation strategy to prevent oxygen incorporation at the Nb surface. This approach enables low-temperature Nb-Nb thermocompression bonding at 350 \u00b0C under a reduced bonding pressure of 0.495 MPa.

Unfortunately, each switch is costly-adding time and space overhead and increasing the logical error rate. Minimizing the number of switching operations is, therefore, essential for quantum computations using code switching.

In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process.

We contrast turbulence of spin waves in ferromagnets with turbulent cascades in the Nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger Equation (NSE) and in an MMT-like model in higher dimensions having a multiplicative interaction vertex: vertex renormalization gives rise to dependence on the pumping (UV scale) in the former but not in the latter.

Modelled as asymmetry with respect to a continuous transformation generated by a physically relevant observable, such as the Hamiltonian or angular moment, unspeakable coherence has been shown to be the relevant notion of coherence for achieving quantum advantage in the tasks of metrology, reference frame alignment and work extraction, among others. A question of both practical and foundational value is: Given some copies of a state with low coherence, can we prepare a more coherent state via coherence non-increasing operations? Here, we study this question in the minimal limiting case: Given two uncorrelated copies of a coherent state, can one, via globally coherence non-increasing unitaries, increase the coherence in a subsystem? We fully solve this problem for qubits, identifying the optimal unitaries and revealing the existence of bound coherence.

We first show that both direct diagonalization and the Krylov method for obtaining the counterdiabatic matrix can be accelerated through the use of subspace techniques, while still maintaining strong performance. We then demonstrate that the cost function used in the standard Krylov method can be further optimized by employing a subspace-based cost function. These findings open up new possibilities for applying counterdiabatic driving in a practical and efficient manner to a variety of quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728Rydberg\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MIS\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u548cKrylov\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u6807\u51c6Krylov\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u9a71\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes governed by the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It takes advantage of the gauge potential in the instantaneous frame rather than the energy spectrum of Hamiltonian. In particular, the dynamics of a general non-Hermitian continuous-variable system is analyzed in the instantaneous frame associated with time-dependent ancillary operators that are superpositions of the laboratory-frame operators and irrelevant to the original Hamiltonian. The gauge potential is determined by the unitary transformation between the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. The upper triangularization condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame enables two of the time-dependent ancillary operators to be nonadiabatic Heisenberg passages of the non-Hermitian system. The probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be restored at the end of these passages without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to the parity-time symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the exceptional point of the spectra; and the latter is consistent with the unidirectional perfect absorbtion.

We implement a noise-aware pulse selection strategy to identify candidate protocols with reduced susceptibility to certain noise sources, then analyze their performance under realistic noise sources -- including atomic motion, Rydberg decay, and experimentally motivated laser phase and intensity noise. For a $^{88}$Sr-based architecture, we demonstrate fast iSWAP gate protocols which exceed fidelities of $99.9\\%$ under realistic experimental conditions.

However, conventional LSTMs suffer from high parameter redundancy and limited nonlinear expressivity. In this work, we propose the Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-Term Memory (QKAN-LSTM), which integrates Data Re-Uploading Activation (DARUAN) modules into the gating structure of LSTMs. Each DARUAN acts as a quantum variational activation function (QVAF), enhancing frequency adaptability and enabling an exponentially enriched spectral representation without multi-qubit entanglement. The resulting architecture preserves quantum-level expressivity while remaining fully executable on classical hardware. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication, demonstrate that QKAN-LSTM achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalization with a 79% reduction in trainable parameters compared to classical LSTMs. We extend the framework to the Jiang-Huang-Chen-Goan Network (JHCG Net), which generalizes KAN to encoder-decoder structures, and then further use QKAN to realize the latent KAN, thereby creating a Hybrid QKAN (HQKAN) for hierarchical representation learning.

We investigate four classical or quantum sequence models, including the Quantum Kernel-based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM), as learned optimizers in a \"learning to learn\" paradigm. Our numerical experiments on the Max-Cut problem demonstrate that the QK-LSTM optimizer achieves superior performance, obtaining the highest approximation ratios and exhibiting the fastest convergence rate across all tested problem sizes (n=10 to 13). Crucially, the QK-LSTM model achieves perfect parameter transferability by synthesizing a single, fixed set of near-optimal parameters, leading to a remarkable sustained acceleration of convergence even when generalizing to larger problems. This capability, enabled by the compact and expressive power of the quantum kernel architecture, underscores its effectiveness.
