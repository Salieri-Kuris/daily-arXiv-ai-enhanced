Comments are welcome!", "summary": "Simulation of stabilizer circuits is a well-studied problem in quantum\ninformation processing, with a number of highly optimized algorithms available.\nYet, we argue that further improvements can arise from the theoretical\nstructure of stabilizer operations themselves. We focus on the subclass of\nstabilizer circuits composed of Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)-preserving\nstabilizer operations, which naturally appear in fault-tolerant computations\nover CSS stabilizer codes. Using elementary circuit-transformation techniques,\nwe show that such circuits can be exactly rewritten as classical probabilistic\ncircuits that reproduce measurement statistics. This rewriting introduces no\ncomputational overhead, in contrast to the general case of stabilizer circuits.\nTo clarify the origin of this simplification, we introduce the standard\nquadratic-form representation of general stabilizer operations (Clifford\nchannels). It provides an efficient way to describe compositions of stabilizer\noperations and thus to simulate stabilizer circuits. CSS-preserving operations\ncorrespond to purely linear forms, which under a Walsh-Hadamard-Fourier\ntransform yield a noncontextual hidden variable model, providing an alternative\nproof of the introduced rewriting. Finally, we develop a theory of reference\nframes for multiqubit systems, where frames are encoded by quadratic forms.\nThis allows us to express stabilizer operations as probabilistic maps for\nproper reference frames. Non-CSS-preserving stabilizer circuits require\ndynamical modifications of reference frames, embodying a contextuality resource\nthat leads to the computational overhead. This framework provides a new\nperspective on simulating stabilizer and near-stabilizer circuits within\ndynamically evolving quasiprobability models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u6982\u7387\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u62dfCSS\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76CSS\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5bb9\u9519\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7535\u8def\u8f6c\u6362\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u4e8c\u6b21\u5f62\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06CSS\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u7684\u7535\u8def\u91cd\u5199\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u6982\u7387\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06CSS\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u7684\u7535\u8def\u91cd\u5199\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u6982\u7387\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u6a21\u62dfCSS\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668\u7684\u7535\u8def\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u6982\u7387\u7535\u8def\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u5199\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5229\u7528\u3002"}}
