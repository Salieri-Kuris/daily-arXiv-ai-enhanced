Belovs [Comput.~Comp.'15] subsequently showed a tight\n$O(\\sqrt{n})$ upper bound.\n  We consider a natural generalization of this problem, parametrized by a\nsubset $\\cal{Q} \\subseteq 2^{[n]}$, where an algorithm may test whether $x_S =\nb$ for an arbitrary $S \\in \\cal{Q}$ and $b \\in \\{-1,1\\}^S$ of its choice, at\nunit cost. We show near-tight bounds when $\\cal{Q}$ is any of the following\ncollections: bounded-size sets, contiguous blocks, prefixes, and only the full\nset.\n  All of these results are derived using a framework that we develop. Using\nsymmetries of the task at hand we show that the quantum query complexity of\nlearning $x$ is characterized, up to a constant factor, by an optimization\nprogram, which is succinctly described as follows: `maximize over all odd\nfunctions $f : \\{-1,1\\}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ the ratio of the maximum value of $f$\nto the maximum (over $T \\in \\cal{Q}$) standard deviation of $f$ on a subcube\nwhose free variables are exactly $T$.'\n  To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to use the primal\nversion of the negative-weight adversary bound (which is a maximization program\ntypically used to show lower bounds) to show new quantum query upper bounds\nwithout explicitly resorting to SDP duality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5e26\u901a\u914d\u7b26\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u8d1f\u6743\u91cd\u5bf9\u624b\u754c\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5b50\u96c6Q\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u5e26\u901a\u914d\u7b26\u641c\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b50\u96c6Q\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5947\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u91cf\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u96c6Q\u7684\u5947\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6bd4\u503c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u754c\u5927\u5c0f\u5b50\u96c6\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u5757\u3001\u524d\u7f00\u3001\u5168\u96c6\u7b49\u5178\u578b\u5b50\u96c6Q\u7684\u8fd1\u7d27\u754c\u9650\u3002\u6240\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u5747\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u9996\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u8d1f\u6743\u91cd\u5bf9\u624b\u754c\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u65b0\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56SDP\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u85cf\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u96c6\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\u5339\u914d\u3002"}}
