### [1] [Superconductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model revealed by neural quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07566)
*Christopher Roth,Ao Chen,Anirvan Sengupta,Antoine Georges*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: The paper uses neural quantum states to study the square lattice Hubbard model, revealing stripe phases and superconductivity coexistence under specific conditions, with uniform d-wave superconductivity at higher doping levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the controversial phase diagram of the square lattice Hubbard model, particularly regarding superconductivity, stripe-ordered states, and their coexistence, which is central to understanding high-temperature cuprate superconductors and ultra-cold fermions.

Method: A new class of neural quantum state (NQS) wavefunctions, extending hidden fermion determinant states to Pfaffians, is used. Fast Pfaffian algorithms enable simulations of several hundred electrons, allowing the measurement of off-diagonal long-range order.

Result: At strong coupling and low hole-doping, a non-superconducting filled stripe phase prevails. Superconductivity coexisting with partially-filled stripes is stabilized by a negative next neighbor hopping t-prime (|t-prime| > 0.1). At larger doping levels, uniform d-wave superconductivity is observed even when t-prime = 0.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of neural quantum state (NQS) approaches in resolving the energetics of the square lattice Hubbard model. It provides evidence for uniform d-wave superconductivity under certain conditions and clarifies the role of stripe phases in suppressing or coexisting with superconductivity.

Abstract: Whether the ground state of the square lattice Hubbard model exhibits superconductivity re- mains a major open question, central to understanding high temperature cuprate superconductors and ultra-cold fermions in optical lattices. Numerical studies have found evidence for stripe-ordered states and superconductivity at strong coupling but the phase diagram remains controversial. Here, we show that one can resolve the subtle energetics of metallic, superconducting, and stripe phases using a new class of neural quantum state (NQS) wavefunctions that extend hidden fermion de- terminant states to Pfaffians. We simulate several hundred electrons using fast Pfaffian algorithms allowing us to measure off-diagonal long range order. At strong coupling and low hole-doping, we find that a non-superconducting filled stripe phase prevails, while superconductivity coexisting with partially-filled stripes is stabilized by a negative next neighbor hopping t-prime, with |t-prime| > 0.1. At larger doping levels, we introduce momentum-space correlation functions to mitigate finite size effects that arise from weakly-bound pairs. These provide evidence for uniform d-wave superconductivity at U = 4, even when t-prime = 0. Our results highlight the potential of NQS approaches, and provide a fresh perspective on superconductivity in the square lattice Hubbard model.

### [3] [Localization transitions in an open quasiperiodic ladder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08053)
*Suparna Sarkar,Soumya Satpathi,Swapan K. Pati*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Dissipation in a quasiperiodic ladder induces a mixed-phase zone, reshaping localization transitions, with critical points tunable by dissipation strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that dissipation can induce a mixed-phase zone in a one-dimensional nearest-neighbor system without imposing constraints on the quasiperiodic potential or hopping parameter.

Method: The study uses an exact correspondence between the eigenspectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator and that of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, along with third quantization approach within Majorana fermionic representation, to analyze dissipation configurations.

Result: Dissipation drives the system into three distinct phases: delocalized, mixed, and localized. The mixed-phase zone emerges under certain dissipation conditions, and its critical points and width can be tuned by varying dissipation strength.

Conclusion: Dissipation plays a decisive role in reshaping localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems, revealing new insights into the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and quasiperiodic order.

Abstract: We investigate localization transition in an open quasiperiodic ladder where the quasiperiodicity is described by the Aubry-André-Harper model. While previous studies have shown that higher-order hopping or constrained quasiperiodic potentials can induce a mixed-phase zone in one dimension, we demonstrate that the dissipation can induce mixed phase zone in a one dimensional nearest-neighbor system without imposing any explicit constraints on the quasiperiodic potential or hopping param- eter. Our approach exploits an exact correspondence between the eigenspectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator and that of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, valid for quadratic fermionic systems un- der linear dissipation. Using third quantization approach within Majorana fermionic representation, we analyze two dissipation configurations: alternating gain and loss at every site, and at alternate sites under balanced and imbalanced conditions. By computing the inverse and normalized partici- pation ratios, we show that dissipation can drive the system into three distinct phases: delocalizd, mixed, and localized. Notably, the mixed-phase zone is absent for balanced dissipation at every site but emerges upon introducing imbalance, while for alternate site dissipation it appears in both balanced and imbalanced cases. Furthermore, the critical points and the width of the mixed-phase window can be selectively tuned by varying the dissipation strength. These findings reveal that the dissipation plays a decisive role in reshaping localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems, offering new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and quasiperiodic order.

### [5] [Cooling of electrons via superconducting tunnel junctions and their arrays exhibiting nodal lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08342)
*Linus Aliani,Viktoriia Kornich*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Superconducting tunnel junctions with π phase differences and ferroelectric barriers can cool electrons by exploiting their complex entropy structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of superconducting tunnel junctions with π phase differences and ferroelectric barriers for electron cooling by leveraging their unique entropy properties.

Method: The study analyzes the entropy structure and cooling process in superconducting tunnel junctions with π phase differences and ferroelectric layers, focusing on divergent or enhanced density of states at nodal lines.

Result: The theoretical study shows that such setups can cool electrons by utilizing a current to transfer heat away from the bath due to the higher entropy in the junction.

Conclusion: These setups, utilizing superconducting tunnel junctions with π phase differences and ferroelectric layers, demonstrate complex entropy structures that enable effective electron cooling through entropy manipulation.

Abstract: We study theoretically a process of cooling electrons using a superconducting tunnel junction with a $π$ phase difference and a usual insulator or a ferroelectric in-between, and an array of such junctions with ferroelectric layers in-between. These setups have a complex structure of entropy due to nodal lines, where the density of states can be divergent or larger than for a free electron gas at a chemical potential level. We consider a small current running from the bath of electrons through the setup, where electrons have to have higher entropy, and thus remove heat from the bath.

### [6] [High-speed antiferromagnetic domain walls driven by coherent spin waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07531)
*Kyle L. Seyler,Hantao Zhang,Daniel Van Beveren,Costel R. Rotundu,Young S. Lee,Ran Cheng,David Hsieh*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Experimental demonstration of ultrafast antiferromagnetic domain wall motion driven by coherent spin waves, achieving record speeds and bidirectional control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop high-speed spintronic devices by leveraging the robustness and potential high velocities of antiferromagnetic materials, specifically through the propulsion of domain walls using coherent spin waves.

Method: Experimental realization using ultrafast laser pulses to generate coherent spin waves and a technique to directly map the spatiotemporal domain wall dynamics in the AFM insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$.

Result: Observation of antiferromagnetic domain wall motion with record-high velocities up to ~50 km/s and bidirectional control through pump laser helicity and the sign of the domain wall winding number.

Conclusion: This work uncovers a novel domain wall propulsion mechanism using coherent spin waves in antiferromagnetic materials, demonstrating record-high velocities and bidirectional control, which opens new opportunities for ultrafast spintronics.

Abstract: The ability to rapidly manipulate domain walls (DWs) in magnetic materials is key to developing novel high-speed spintronic memory and computing devices. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials present a particularly promising platform due to their robustness against stray fields and their potential for exceptional DW velocities. Among various proposed driving mechanisms, coherent spin waves could potentially propel AFM DWs to the magnon group velocity while minimizing dissipation from Joule heating. However, experimental realization has remained elusive due to the dual challenges of generating coherent AFM spin waves near isolated mobile AFM DWs and simultaneously measuring high-speed DW dynamics. Here we experimentally realize an approach where ultrafast laser pulses generate coherent spin waves that drive AFM DWs and develop a technique to directly map the spatiotemporal DW dynamics. Using the room-temperature AFM insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$, we observe AFM DW motion with record-high velocities up to ~50 km/s. Remarkably, the direction of DW propagation is controllable through both the pump laser helicity and the sign of the DW winding number. This bidirectional control can be theoretically explained, and numerically reproduced, by the DW dynamics induced by coherent spin waves of the in-plane magnon mode - a phenomenon unique to magnets with an easy-plane anisotropy. Our work uncovers a novel DW propulsion mechanism that is generalizable to a wide range of AFM materials, unlocking new opportunities for ultrafast coherent AFM spintronics.

TL;DR: Study uncovers a topological ferromagnetic metal-insulator transition in K2Cr8O16, driven by electron correlations, opening new pathways in quantum materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate topological phenomena with correlated electron physics for next-generation quantum devices by studying metal-insulator transitions (MITs).

Method: Inelastic x-ray and neutron scattering experiments combined with first-principles theoretical calculations.

Result: Demonstrated a ferromagnetic MIT with a change in band topology in K2Cr8O16, identifying it as a topological-FM-MIT with potential axionic properties, driven by electron correlations rather than a Peierls mechanism.

Conclusion: This work pioneers the discovery of a topological-FM-MIT and reveals a new class of topological phase transitions, highlighting the interaction between magnetism, topology, and electronic correlations.

Abstract: A major challenge in condensed matter physics is integrating topological phenomena with correlated electron physics to leverage both types of states for next-generation quantum devices. Metal-insulator transitions (MITs) are central to bridging these two domains while simultaneously serving as 'on-off' switches for electronic states. Here, we demonstrate how the prototypical material of K2Cr8O16 undergoes a ferromagnetic MIT accompanied by a change in band topology. Through inelastic x-ray and neutron scattering experiments combined with first-principles theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that this transition is not driven by a Peierls mechanism, given the lack of phonon softening. Instead, we establish the transition as a topological MIT within the ferromagnetic phase (topological-FM-MIT) with potential axionic properties, where electron correlations play a key role in stabilizing the insulating state. This work pioneers the discovery of a topological-FM-MIT and represents a fundamentally new class of topological phase transitions, revealing a unique pathway through which magnetism, topology, and electronic correlations interact.

### [8] [Steady-states and response functions of the periodically driven O(N) scalar field theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08584)
*Oriana K. Diessel,Subir Sachdev,Pietro M. Bonetti*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Study of a driven O(N)-symmetric theory reveals oscillating order-parameter phases, Meissner effects, and a novel 'Meissner polariton,' with implications for light-induced superconductivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the phase behavior and electromagnetic responses of a driven O(N)-symmetric theory coupled to a thermal bath, particularly focusing on light-induced orders like superconductivity.

Method: The paper analyzes the phase diagram of a relativistic, parametrically driven O(N)-symmetric theory coupled to a Markovian thermal bath, examining uniform and spatially modulated symmetry-broken states and their responses to electromagnetic potentials.

Result: The analysis uncovers phases with oscillating order parameters, a Meissner effect for the photon mass, and a novel 'Meissner polariton' phenomenon where magnetic fields penetrate as standing waves. Near symmetry-breaking onset, a superconducting-like response emerges without traditional Meissner effects.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the relativistic, parametrically driven O(N)-symmetric theory coupled to a thermal bath exhibits diverse phases, including oscillating order parameters and Meissner effects. These findings are significant for experiments on light-induced orders, especially superconductivity.

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a relativistic, parametrically driven O($N$)-symmetric theory coupled to a Markovian thermal bath. Our analysis reveals a rich variety of phases, including both uniform and spatially modulated symmetry-broken states, some of which feature an order parameter oscillating at half the drive frequency. When coupled to a background electromagnetic potential, these phases exhibit a Meissner effect, in the sense that the photon acquires a mass term. However, if the order parameter oscillates around a sufficiently small value, a fraction of an externally applied magnetic field can penetrate the sample in the form of a standing wave. We dub this property a \textit{Meissner polariton}, that is, a collective mode resulting from the hybridization of light with order parameter oscillations. Furthermore, near the onset of symmetry breaking, strong fluctuations give rise to a superconducting-like response even in the absence of a Meissner effect or of a Meissner polariton. Our results are relevant to experiments on light-induced orders, particularly superconductivity.

### [9] [Parametric Instabilities of Correlated Quantum Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07527)
*Gal Shavit,Gil Refael*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A framework for parametric driving of bosonic modes in quantum materials is proposed, enabling control over non-equilibrium phases and novel steady states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore non-equilibrium phenomena in strongly correlated quantum materials by focusing on collective bosonic excitations and their role in tuning material properties.

Method: A general theoretical framework is developed for parametric driving of bosonic modes, involving periodic modulation of microscopic parameters to generate resonant two-boson processes.

Result: The driving mechanism facilitates nonthermal melting of parent orders and stabilization of novel steady states, with experimental signatures. The feasibility of driving is linked to the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that collective excitations are a powerful resource for manipulating correlated quantum phases out of equilibrium, with broad applications in quantum science.

Abstract: Strongly correlated quantum materials exhibit a rich landscape of ordered phases with highly tunable properties, making them an intriguing platform for exploring non-equilibrium phenomena. A key to many of these phases is collective bosonic excitations, encoding fluctuations of the underlying order. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework for parametric driving of such modes, whereby periodic modulation of microscopic parameters generates resonant two-boson processes. We show that the feasibility and strength of this drive depend sensitively on whether the targeted parameter alters the properties of the bosonic excitations vacuum, linking potential parametric instabilities directly to the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state. The driving facilitates nonthermal melting of the parent orders, as well as stabilization of novel steady states with experimentally distinct signatures. Through microscopic case-studies of correlated electronic systems, we identify promising driving knobs, highlight the role of quantum geometry in the collective modes susceptibility, and propose realistic experimental probes. Collective excitations are a powerful resource for steering correlated phases out of equilibrium, and will likely have several applications in quantum science. Our work provides the toolbox for controlling these excitations.

Conclusion: 作者提出了一个新的度量家族，用于通过对称性测试量化二部及多部量子纠缠。通过优化采样策略，展示了实验可行性，并在多体系统中验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recently, a technique known as quantum symmetry test has gained increasing attention for detecting bipartite entanglement in pure quantum states. In this work we show that, beyond qualitative detection, a family of well-defined measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement can be obtained with symmetry tests. We propose and benchmark several efficient methods to estimate these measures, and derive near-optimal sampling strategies for each. Despite the nonlinearity of the methods, we demonstrate that the sampling error scales no worse than $O(N_{\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/2})$ with the total number of copies $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$, which suggests experimental feasibility. By exploiting symmetries we compute our measures for large number of copies, and derive the asymptotic decay exponents for relevant states in many-body systems. Using these results we identify tradeoffs between estimation complexity and sensitivity of the presented entanglement measures, oriented to practical implementations.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Studied SRE spreading in quantum systems under random Clifford circuits, revealing diffusive and superdiffusive behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the spreading of nonstabilizerness (magic) in many-body quantum systems, a key resource for quantum computation and advantage.

Method: Analyzed the spreading of stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) via single-qubit reduced density matrices under brickwork random Clifford circuits, including Haar-random and restricted Clifford gates.

Result: Found a diffusive spreading profile within a ballistic light cone for Haar-random local Clifford gates and a superdiffusive spreading for restricted Clifford circuits.

Conclusion: The study highlights the non-ballistic and diffusive nature of SRE spreading in quantum systems under random Clifford circuits, providing insights into the dynamics of nonstabilizerness.

Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or magic, constitutes a fundamental resource for quantum computation and a crucial ingredient for quantum advantage. Recent progress has substantially advanced the characterization of magic in many-body quantum systems, with stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) emerging as a computable and experimentally accessible measure. In this work, we investigate the spreading of SRE in terms of single-qubit reduced density matrices, where an initial product state that contains magic in a local region evolves under brickwork random Clifford circuits. For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. We further examine the robustness of this non-ballistic behavior of the normalized single-qubit SRE spreading by extending the analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit, where we unveil a superdiffusive spreading.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the distribution and interactions of magic (non-stabilizerness) in multipartite settings, which is crucial for universal fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Method: The research builds upon mana, a quantifier based on discrete Wigner function negativity, and investigates magic correlations generated by discrete beamsplitters.

Result: The study shows that coupling a magic state with a stabilizer vacuum state via a discrete beamsplitter fully converts local magic into mutual mana, establishing a mechanism for magic redistribution.

Conclusion: The study introduces mutual mana as a measure of magic correlations in multipartite settings, demonstrating its properties through explicit expressions for qutrit states and comparing it with other correlation quantifiers.

Abstract: Magic (non-stabilizerness) is a key resource for achieving universal fault-tolerant quantum computation beyond classical computation. While previous studies have primarily focused on magic in single systems, its interactions and distribution in multipartite settings remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce mutual mana as a measure of magic correlations defined in close analogy with quantum mutual information. Our definition builds upon mana, which is the established quantifier of magic based on discrete Wigner function negativity. We characterize magic correlations generated by discrete beamsplitters, whose Gaussian counterparts are fundamental components in quantum optics and quantum technologies. We show that coupling a magic state with a stabilizer vacuum state via a discrete beamsplitter will induce a full conversion of local magic into mutual mana, thereby establishing a mechanism for redistributing magic resources as magic correlations. We reveal the fundamental properties of mutual mana and derive its explicit expressions for several prototypical qutrit states subject to a discrete beamsplitter. We make a comparative study of mutual mana with several established quantifiers of correlations generated by the qutrit beamsplitter, including quantum mutual information, mutual $L^1$-norm magic, and mutual stabilizer 2-Rényi entropy.

Motivation: Elucidating the emergence of irreversible macroscopic laws from reversible quantum many-body dynamics is a key challenge in quantum science, with many-body decoherence playing a pivotal role.

Method: Through Floquet engineering and (optical) environment modulation, the study demonstrates control over decoherence channels in a doubly disordered electron-nuclear spin network.

Result: An emergent decoherence law for nuclear polarization, robust across broad parameter regimes, is uncovered, with its microscopic origins traced to two interdependent decoherence channels: long-range interactions mediated by the electron network and spin transport within the nuclear network exhibiting sub-diffusive dynamics.

Conclusion: Disorder, typically viewed as detrimental, proves protective in generating isolated electron-free clusters that localize polarization and prolong coherence lifetimes, suggesting engineered disorder as a new design principle for long-lived quantum memories and sensors.

Abstract: Elucidating the emergence of irreversible macroscopic laws from reversible quantum many-body dynamics is a question of broad importance across all quantum science. Many-body decoherence plays a key role in this transition, yet connecting microscopic dynamics to emergent macroscopic behavior remains challenging. Here, in a doubly disordered electron-nuclear spin network, we uncover an emergent decoherence law for nuclear polarization, $e^{-\sqrt{R_{p}t}}e^{-R_{d}t}$, that is robust across broad parameter regimes. We trace its microscopic origins to two interdependent decoherence channels: long-range interactions mediated by the electron network and spin transport within the nuclear network exhibiting anomalous, sub-diffusive dynamics. We demonstrate the capacity to control--and even eliminate--either channel individually through a combination of Floquet engineering and (optical) environment modulation. We find that disorder, typically viewed as detrimental, here proves protective, generating isolated electron-free clusters that localize polarization and prolong coherence lifetimes. These findings establish a microscopic framework for manipulating decoherence pathways and suggests engineered disorder as a new design principle for realizing long-lived quantum memories and sensors.

Result: A broadband quantum noise reduction of 3.6 dB (77% reduction) at the optimal frequency, meeting CQNC targets from prior studies.

Conclusion: The realization of an ENMO scheme demonstrates readiness for practical applications, projecting a 77% reduction in quantum back-action noise. Future prospects include new applications in quantum information and communication.

Abstract: We report the realization of an all-optical, tabletop effective-negative-mass oscillator (ENMO) scheme capable of canceling quantum noise when cascaded with an opto-mechanical sensor susceptible to (quantum) radiation pressure noise. Our coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) scheme offers a broadband cancellation capability with a tunable, wavelength-flexible, and compact system. This is achieved through the implementation of an optical equivalent of an opto-mechanical interaction, facilitated by a down-conversion and a beam-splitting process. The intricate nature of the system and its multiple interacting components made characterizing the interdependent parameters with conventional methods ineffective, leading to the development of an in-situ characterization scheme. The obtained parameters meet the targets for CQNC set in previous studies. With our current realization, we project a broadband quantum noise reduction of 3.6 dB, corresponding to a 77% reduction in quantum back-action noise at the optimal frequency of maximum reduction, indicating the readiness of the ENMO for application. We discuss the prospects for new applications in quantum information and communication using the same platform.

Motivation: The research aims to investigate the potential of a quantum battery system to harness noise-induced coherences and predict ergotropy regimes through statistical and machine learning approaches.

Method: The methodology involves applying full counting statistics to analyze higher-order fluctuations of quanta exchange in a cavity-coupled finite quantum system, used as a quantum battery. This serves as a training platform for unsupervised and supervised learning models.

Result: Results demonstrate that the kurtosis of quanta exchange and noise-induced coherence are key features for accurately classifying ergotropy into different regimes.

Conclusion: The study concludes that traditional quantum and thermodynamic variables are insufficient for identifying high ergotropy regimes. Instead, the kurtosis of quanta exchange and noise-induced coherence in the leakage mode play dominant roles in controlling ergotropy.

Abstract: We introduce a cavity-coupled finite quantum system which can act as a quantum battery by harnessing noise induced coherences. We apply the methodology of full counting statistics to capture higher-order fluctuations of quanta exchange in the storage station. Together with the thermodynamic parameters, the fluctuations constitute a training platform for unsupervised as well as supervised learning models in predicting ergotropy. We identify a minimal predictive feature set from the battery's operating parameters that can classify the ergotropy into different regimes with great accuracy.Our results show that the usual quantum and thermodynamic variables are inadequate for the purpose of identifying high ergotropy regimes in isolation. Rather, it is the kurtosis of quanta exchange in the storage and the noise-induced coherence in the leakage mode that become the dominant quantities in controlling the magnitude of ergotropy.

Abstract: We use superconducting qubit quantum annealing devices to determine the ground state of Ising models with algebraically decaying competing long-range interactions in the thermodynamic limit. This is enabled by a unit-cell-based optimization scheme, in which the finite optimizations on each unit cell are performed using commercial quantum annealing hardware. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, we choose three exemplary problems relevant for other quantum simulation platforms and material science: (i) the calculation of devil's staircases of magnetization plateaux of the long-range Ising model in a longitudinal field on the triangular lattice, motivated by atomic and molecular quantum simulators; (ii) the evaluation of the ground state of the same model on the Kagome lattice in the absence of a field, motivated by artificial spin ice metamaterials; (iii) the study of models with additional few-nearest-neighbor interactions relevant for frustrated Ising compounds with potential long-range interactions. The approach discussed in this work provides a useful and realistic application of existing quantum annealing technology, applicable across many research areas in which lattice problems with resummable long-range interactions are relevant.

Motivation: To address the contradiction in the quantum phase diagram of the Dicke-Ising model presented by Mendonça et al., showing that specific features (intermediate phase and phase transition orders) are indeed present.

Method: The authors present a reanalysis or demonstration of the Dicke-Ising model, countering the claims made by Mendonça et al.

TL;DR: The paper identifies a new inverse-distance many-body QED interaction, weaker than van der Waals but potentially stronger than gravity at microscopic scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore emergent quantum interactions beyond the traditional fundamental and van der Waals/Casimir interactions, focusing on the coupling between virtual photons and molecular plasmons.

Method: Perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) applied to a many-body system of atoms modeled as charged harmonic oscillators.

Result: Discovery of an inverse-distance MB-QED interaction scaling with the third power of the fine-structure constant, reminiscent of the Lamb shift for a single atom.

Conclusion: The paper reveals a persistent inverse-distance MB-QED interaction in many-body systems, which, although weaker than van der Waals forces, may surpass gravitational attraction in microscopic quantum gravity experiments.

Abstract: Interactions between objects can be classified as fundamental or emergent. Fundamental interactions are either extremely short-range or decay inversely with the separation distance, such as the Coulomb potential between charges or the gravitational attraction between masses. In contrast, emergent quantum van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir interactions decay considerably faster ($R^{-6}$ or $R^{-7}$) with distance $R$. Here we apply perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) to a many-body (MB) system of atoms modeled as charged harmonic oscillators, and reveal a persistent inverse-distance MB-QED interaction stemming from the coupling between virtual photons and molecular plasmons in the non-retarded regime. This interaction, scaling with the third power of the fine-structure constant, is reminiscent of the Lamb shift for a single atom. Although weaker than vdW forces, this MB-QED $R^{-1}$ interaction may substantially surpass gravitational attraction in future experiments probing quantum gravity at microscopic scales.

Abstract: Some of lattice-gauge-theory models, in particular gauge-Higgs model (GHM), can be regarded and work as a subsystem code. This work studies the effect of local-gauge-symmetric decoherence on the GHM from the perspective of the subsystem code. We clarify the global phase diagram of the subsystem code. In particular, the decoherence induces an unconventional critical mixed state, where the logical information is preserved but the rest of the system exhibits mixed state criticality. For a fixed point, the decohered subsystem code is understood by the ``gauging out" prescription. By mapping the GHM to the toric code subject to decoherence, we can understand the properties of the subsystem code. We further discuss and investigate the robustness of the logical space of the subsystem code. Although this kind of subsystem code can be produced by using any bulk mixed state in the GHM, its robustness is a subtle problem due to the mixed critical gauge qubits. We consider some specific unitary for examining the robustness of the stored quantum information. For dynamical unitary perturbations described by interactions between the logical qubit and gauge qubits, the deformation of the subsystem code drastically depends on the initial mixed state of the gauge qubits.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parametric amplification is a key phenomenon in classical and quantum domains, but its use for fluctuation engineering in Raman-cavity hybrids has only recently been explored. This work aims to extend this to multi-mode interactions.

Method: We generalize fluctuation engineering to a multi-mode scenario where multiple Raman-active modes interact nonlinearly with multiple cavity modes. We demonstrate resonant and non-resonant collective fluctuations controllable by engineering the band dispersion of photons and phonons.

Result: We show selective attenuation of Raman fluctuations by tuning the photonic bandgap and nonresonant amplification, surpassing single-mode scenarios. A regime where cavity fluctuations in a specific mode are boosted beyond √N scaling with increasing N modes is identified.

Conclusion: Our study reveals the key role of multi-mode interactions on fluctuations in nonlinear cavity-matter hybrids. Noise engineering through different photon and phonon dispersions could be leveraged for novel quantum sensing platforms and advanced spectroscopy in the THz regime.

Abstract: Parametric amplification is a key ingredient of a wide range of phenomena, from the classical to the quantum domain. Although such phenomena have been demonstrated in non-equilibrium settings, their use for fluctuation engineering has been put forth in Raman-cavity hybrids only recently. In this work, we generalize fluctuation engineering to a multi-mode scenario in which multiple Raman-active modes interact nonlinearly with multiple cavity modes. We demonstrate the emergence of resonant and non-resonant collective fluctuations that can be non-reciprocally controlled by engineering the band dispersion of photons and phonons. As an example we show how Raman fluctuations can be selectively attenuated by tuning the photonic bandgap or even nonresonantly amplified, in marked contrast to the single-mode scenario. We also identify a regime in which the amplification of cavity fluctuations in a specific mode is boosted, surpassing a $\sqrt{N}$ scaling with increasing number of $N$ Raman and cavity modes. Our study reveals the key role of multi-mode interactions on fluctuations in nonlinear cavity-matter hybrids. Noise engineering through different photon and phonon dispersions, as demonstrated here, could be leveraged for the design of novel quantum sensing platforms and advanced spectroscopy in the THz regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantum computing devices are limited by noise, particularly from entangling gates. Efficient gate sequences are often unknown, leading to the use of suboptimal hardware-efficient ansätze with fixed entangling structures.

Method: A reinforcement learning algorithm is employed to optimize the entangling gate sequence for quantum state preparation, incorporating general single-qubit unitaries and considering qubit connectivity architecture.

Result: The approach consistently achieves higher state preparation fidelities using the same number of CNOT gates as traditional methods.

Conclusion: The reinforcement learning algorithm successfully extends to parameterized gate sets, achieving higher state preparation fidelities with fewer CNOT gates compared to traditional hardware-efficient ansätze.

Abstract: Current experimental quantum computing devices are limited by noise, mainly originating from entangling gates. If an efficient gate sequence for an operation is unknown, one often employs layered parameterized quantum circuits, especially hardware-efficient ansätze, with fixed entangling layer structures. We demonstrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to improve on these by optimizing the entangling gate sequence in the task of quantum state preparation. This allows us to restrict the required number of CNOT gates while taking the qubit connectivity architecture into account. Recent advancements using reinforcement learning have already demonstrated the power of this technique when optimizing the circuit for a sequence of non-parameterized gates. We extend this approach to parameterized gate sets by incorporating general single-qubit unitaries, thus allowing us to consistently reach higher state preparation fidelities at the same number of CNOT gates compared to a hardware-efficient ansatz.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the behavior of entangled photon pairs in complex media beyond simplifying assumptions, advancing understanding and applications in quantum technologies.

Method: The research combined experimental demonstrations with comprehensive theoretical and numerical analyses to study entangled photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down conversion and their behavior in disordered media.

Result: The entangled photon pairs exhibited persistent sharp correlations despite dynamic scattering, with the angular correlation shape depending on pump scattering and generation-to-medium distance.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that entangled photon pairs maintain sharp correlation peaks even when passing through dynamic scattering media, providing insights for quantum light generation in complex media and potential applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Scattering of non-classical light is enabling new ways to study and control photon transport. However, advances in this field often rely on simplifying assumptions regarding the quantum light's generation and its source. In this work, we relax some of these assumptions and probe the behavior of entangled photon pairs passing through a disordered layer after being generated by a randomly scattered pump via spontaneous parametric down conversion. We experimentally demonstrate that, even when both the pump and the down-converted photons propagate through a dynamic scattering medium, the pairs maintain a sharp peak in their correlations. A comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis shows that these correlations persist regardless of when the pairs are generated, whether immediately after the pump is scattered or under other conditions. More specifically, we detail how the shape of the angular correlation depends on the pump's scattering and how it varies with the distance between the pair-generation region and the entrance of the disordered medium. These findings represent a crucial step toward understanding quantum light generation in complex media, and potentially exploiting it for quantum technologies.

Motivation: To investigate whether shallow quantum circuits can accurately reproduce the short-horizon dynamics of discrete-time Markov chains derived from fashion electronic-commerce recommendation links.

Method: Transition operators are compiled into block-encoded circuits and iterated using fixed-point oblivious amplitude amplification. Amplitude-encoded marginals are used to estimate the classical push-forward.

Result: Hub pruning improves quantum and classical agreement at shallow depth, reducing total-variation distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence by approximately a factor of two. State fidelities remain close to unity.

Conclusion: Hub-pruned block-encodings are identified as a practical heuristic for near-term experiments on recommendation dynamics using small quantum registers. The study provides a reproducible benchmarking protocol with clear metrics.

Abstract: We investigate whether shallow quantum circuits can accurately reproduce the short-horizon dynamics of discrete-time Markov chains derived from fashion electronic-commerce recommendation links. Transition operators are compiled into block-encoded circuits and iterated using fixed-point oblivious amplitude amplification, and amplitude-encoded marginals are used to estimate the classical push-forward. Empirically, colour categories such as black and, to a lesser extent, white function as high-degree hubs that dominate probability flow. Consequently, we assess three chain variants: the full network including all colours, a network without black, and a network without black and white, to quantify the effect of hub pruning under realistic circuit depths and measurement budgets. Across networks aggregated from multiple retailers, hub pruning consistently improves quantum and classical agreement at shallow depth; total-variation distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence typically decrease by approximately a factor of two relative to the full network, while state fidelities remain close to unity. A bias-and-contraction analysis explains these gains through reduced cross-terms and an effectively widened spectral gap. The results identify hub-pruned block-encodings as a practical heuristic for near-term experiments on recommendation dynamics using small quantum registers, and they provide a reproducible benchmarking protocol that reports total-variation distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and state fidelity as functions of circuit depth and prediction horizon.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of enabling practitioners without quantum expertise to transition from classical to hybrid quantum-classical machine learning workflows. We propose a three-stage framework: starting with a classical self-training model, then introducing a minimal hybrid quantum variant, and finally applying diagnostic feedback via QMetric to refine the hybrid architecture. In experiments on the Iris dataset, the refined hybrid model improved accuracy from 0.31 in the classical approach to 0.87 in the quantum approach.

Abstract: The Exact Factorization (EF) theory aims at the separation of the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in the many-body (MB) quantum mechanical problem. Being formally equivalent to the solution of the MB Schrödinger equation, EF sets up a strategy for the construction of efficient approximations in the theory of the correlated electronic-nuclear motion. Here we extend the EF formalism to incorporate the case of a system under the action of an electromagnetic field. An important interplay between the physical magnetic and the Berry-curvature fields is revealed and discussed within the fully non-adiabatic theory. In particular, it is a known property of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that, for a neutral atom in a uniform magnetic field, the latter is compensated by the Berry-curvature field in the nuclear equation of motion (\citet{Yin-92}). From an intuitive argument that the atom must not be deflected by the Lorentz force from a straight line trajectory, it has been conjectured that the same compensation should occur within the EF theory as well. We give a rigorous proof of this property.

*Gonzalo Camacho,Julio I. de Vicente*

TL;DR: Extending previous work, this paper proves that maximally entangled states for fixed spectra do not exist for rank-2, rank-3, and most rank-4 two-qubit states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize the notion of maximal entanglement beyond pure states by exploring whether such states exist for fixed spectra, addressing a gap in quantum information theory.

Method: The method involves analyzing the possibility of maximal entanglement in states with fixed spectra, focusing on rank-2, rank-3, and partial rank-4 two-qubit density matrices.

Result: The results show that no maximally entangled state exists for rank-2 and rank-3 two-qubit states, and for many rank-4 cases, confirming the negative answer to the generalized question.

Conclusion: The study concludes that a maximally entangled state for a fixed spectrum does not exist for rank-2 and rank-3 two-qubit states, as well as for a significant subset of rank-4 cases, extending previous findings.

Abstract: The existence of a maximally entangled pure state is a cornerstone result of entanglement theory that has paramount consequences in quantum information theory. A natural generalization of this property is to consider whether a notion of maximal entanglement is possible among all states with the same spectrum (where the aforementioned case of pure states corresponds to the particular choice in which the spectrum is a delta distribution, i.e., rank-1 states). Despite positive evidence in the past that such a notion might exist at least in the case of two-qubit states, it was recently shown in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 050202 (2024)] that the answer to the above question is negative. This reference proved this for particular choices of the spectrum in the case of rank-2 two-qubit density matrices. While this settles the problem in general, it still leaves open whether there are other choices of the spectrum outside the case of pure states where a maximally entangled state for a fixed spectrum might exist. In this work we extend this impossibility result to all rank-2 and rank-3 two-qubit states as well as for a large class of eigenvalue distributions in the case where the rank equals four.

Motivation: The optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolver is challenged by finite-shot sampling noise, which distorts the cost landscape and induces statistical bias. The paper aims to investigate this phenomenon and identify effective optimization strategies under noise.

Method: The study benchmarks eight classical optimizers (gradient-based, gradient-free, and metaheuristic methods) on quantum chemistry Hamiltonians using the Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz. It analyzes the challenges of gradient-based methods in noisy regimes and proposes correcting bias by tracking the population mean.

Result: The results show that adaptive metaheuristics (CMA-ES and iL-SHADE) are the most effective and resilient strategies for VQE optimization under noise. Gradient-based methods struggle in noisy regimes, while population-based optimizers can correct bias by tracking the population mean.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by presenting practical guidelines for reliable VQE optimization under noise, emphasizing the co-design of physically motivated ansatz and the use of adaptive optimizers.

Abstract: The optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolver is severely challenged by finite-shot sampling noise, which distorts the cost landscape, creates false variational minima, and induces statistical bias called winner's curse. We investigate this phenomenon by benchmarking eight classical optimizers spanning gradient-based, gradient-free, and metaheuristic methods on quantum chemistry Hamiltonians H$_2$, H$_4$ chain, LiH (in both full and active spaces) using the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz. We analyze difficulties of gradient-based methods (e.g., SLSQP, BFGS) in noisy regimes, where they diverge or stagnate. We show that the bias of estimator can be corrected by tracking the \textit{population mean}, rather than the biased best individual when using population based optimizer. Our findings, which are shown to generalize to hardware-efficient circuits and condensed matter models, identify adaptive metaheuristics (specifically CMA-ES and iL-SHADE) as the most effective and resilient strategies. We conclude by presenting a set of practical guidelines for reliable VQE optimization under noise, centering on the co-design of physically motivated ansatz and the use of adaptive optimizers.

TL;DR: Quantum walks on cycle graphs can generate near-uniform random sequences asymptotically, with correlations minimized by tuning parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To sample from an almost-uniform distribution without relying on external randomness.

Method: Utilizing discrete-time quantum walks on a cycle graph with a fixed number of steps, resetting the walker after each measurement.

Result: The sequence converges to uniformity under ergodic conditions, with correlations reduced by optimizing evolution time.

Conclusion: The quantum walk sequence asymptotically converges to a uniform distribution when specific conditions are met.

Abstract: We investigate the use of discrete-time quantum walks to sample from an almost-uniform distribution, in the absence of any external source of randomness. Integers are encoded on the vertices of a cycle graph, and a quantum walker evolves for a fixed number of steps before its position is measured and recorded. The walker is then reset to the measured site, and the procedure is iterated to produce the sequence of random numbers. We show that when the quantum walk parameters, such as the coin operator and initial state, satisfy the conditions of the ergodic theorem for random walks on finite groups, the resulting sequence converges asymptotically to the uniform distribution. Although correlations between successive outcomes are unavoidable, they can be significantly reduced by a suitable choice of the evolution time. By analyzing the iterated convolution of the quantum walk transition probability and exploiting the ergodic theorem, we demonstrate convergence of the marginal distributions toward the uniform distribution in the asymptotic limit.

Conclusion: The hybrid quantum-classical model shows potential for improving the efficiency and expressivity of NLP models, as demonstrated by its superior performance in the simulated MNIST dataset task.

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Classical (HQC) algorithms constitute one of the most effective paradigms for exploiting the computational advantages of quantum systems in large-scale numerical tasks. By operating in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, quantum circuits enable exponential speed-ups and provide access to richer representations of cost landscapes compared to purely classical methods. These capabilities are particularly relevant for machine learning, where state-of-the-art models especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) suffer from prohibitive time complexity due to massive matrix multiplications and high-dimensional optimization.
  In this manuscript, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Classical selection mechanism for the Mamba architecture, designed specifically for temporal sequence classification problems. Our approach leverages Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as quantum gating modules that both enhance feature extraction and improve suppression of irrelevant information. This integration directly addresses the computational bottlenecks of deep learning architectures by exploiting quantum resources for more efficient representation learning.
  We analyze how introducing quantum subroutines into large language models (LLMs) impacts their generalization capability, expressivity, and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Qubit-efficient optimization seeks to represent an $N$-variable combinatorial problem within a Hilbert space smaller than $2^N$, using only as much quantum structure as the objective itself requires. Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, for example, depend only on pairwise information -- expectations and correlations between binary variables -- yet standard quantum circuits explore exponentially large state spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometry problem: the minimal representation should match the $O(N^2)$ structure of quadratic objectives. The key insight is that the local-consistency problem -- ensuring that pairwise marginals correspond to a realizable global distribution -- coincides exactly with the Sherali-Adams level-2 polytope $\mathrm{SA}(2)$, the tightest convex relaxation expressible at the two-body level. Previous qubit-efficient approaches enforced this consistency only implicitly. Here we make it explicit: (a) anchoring learning to the $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ geometry, (b) projecting via a differentiable iterative-proportional-fitting (IPF) step, and (c) decoding through a maximum-entropy Gibbs sampler. This yields a logarithmic-width pipeline ($2\lceil\log_2 N\rceil + 2$ qubits) that is classically simulable yet achieves strong empirical performance. On Gset Max-Cut instances (N=800--2000), depth-2--3 circuits reach near-optimal ratios ($r^* \approx 0.99$), surpassing direct $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ baselines. The framework resolves the local-consistency gap by giving it a concrete convex geometry and a minimal differentiable projection, establishing a clean polyhedral baseline. Extending beyond $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ naturally leads to spectrahedral geometries, where curvature encodes global coherence and genuine quantum structure becomes necessary.

TL;DR: The paper explores the SPS ansatz as an alternative to tensor networks for many-body quantum systems, demonstrating its accuracy and flexibility in solving ground state problems for Ising models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of tensor networks (TNs) in studying many-body quantum systems, particularly their expressive power and information extraction challenges for generic geometries, by exploring the SPS ansatz as an alternative.

Method: The study investigates the superposition-of-product-states (SPS) ansatz, a variational framework related to canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It analyzes the ansatz's properties such as entanglement entropy and trainability, and applies it to ground state searches in tilted Ising models across different geometries.

Result: The SPS ansatz shows potential for accurately extracting information, is geometry-independent, parallelizable, and allows analytical shortcuts. It achieves high accuracy in ground state searches for various Ising models.

Conclusion: The SPS ansatz demonstrates high accuracy in ground state searches for various Ising models, including different dimensions and interaction ranges, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness despite its lower compression capability compared to tensor networks.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) are one of the best available tools to study many-body quantum systems. TNs are particularly suitable for one-dimensional local Hamiltonians, while their performance for generic geometries is mainly limited by two aspects: the limitation in expressive power and the approximate extraction of information. Here we investigate the performance of superposition-of-product-states (SPS) ansatz, a variational framework structurally related to canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. The ansatz does not compress information as effectively as tensor networks, but it has the advantages (i) of allowing accurate extraction of information, (ii) of being structurally independent of the geometry of the system, (iii) of being readily parallelizable, and (iv) of allowing analytical shortcuts. We first study the typical properties of the SPS ansatz for spin-$1/2$ systems, including its entanglement entropy, and its trainability. We then use this ansatz for ground state search in tilted Ising models--including one-dimensional and three-dimensional with short- and long-range interaction, and a random network--demonstrating that SPS can attain high accuracy.

Motivation: To explore the geometric relationship between Bloch vector representations and Lorentzian line shapes in spectroscopy, and to develop new methods for manipulating spectral lines.

Method: The paper studies and generalizes Newton's hyperbolism of curves to transform ellipses into Lorentzian lines and vice versa. It introduces a continuous parametrization of this transform and explores its implications for line shapes.

Result: The paper reveals a direct geometric link between the Bloch picture and Lorentzian line shapes, introduces a continuous parametrization of Newton's transform, and demonstrates a new apodization approach for generating truncated parabolic lines.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a geometric connection between the Bloch picture and Lorentzian line shapes, introduces a novel continuous parametrization of Newton's transform, and proposes a new apodization method for experimental spectra, with applications in NMR spectroscopy.

Abstract: The Fourier transform (FT) represents a key tool in modern spectroscopy which drastically reduces measurement times and helps to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in spectra. Fourier transforming exponentially decaying time domain signals gives Lorentzian line shapes which can be manipulated by apodization methods. The underlying transitions of spectral lines can be visualized by a Bloch vector or equivalent phase-space representations. Here, we study and generalize a surprisingly elegant geometric transform, the hyperbolism of curves originally found by Isaac Newton, which allows to transform ellipses into Lorentzian lines, and vice versa. With this, we show that the Bloch picture and especially corresponding phase-space representations are directly geometrically related to the Lorentzian line shape. We also introduce a novel continuous parametrization of Newton's transform which results in further interesting line shapes. In particular, we find that truncated parabolic lines with finite support can be obtained by the half transform and introduce a new apodization approach to replicate this line shape in experimental spectra. We discuss concrete applications in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the performance and robustness of analytic shortcut-to-adiabatic-inspired protocols versus brute-force numerical optimization techniques in state-of-the-art quantum computing.

Method: The paper compares an analytical counterdiabatic method with a numerically optimized protocol using the Boulder Opal platform for implementing high-fidelity quantum gates on Rydberg atoms.

Result: The numerically optimized gate achieves higher fidelities and demonstrates robustness against errors similar to the effective counterdiabatic gate.

Conclusion: The study highlights the trade-offs between analytical and numerical approaches for quantum gate optimization, emphasizing the impact of constraints on pulse optimization.

Abstract: A shortcut-to-adiabaticity is compared with a numerically optimized protocol for implementing a high-fidelity quantum gate on Rydberg atoms. The counterdiabatic method offers an analytical framework for accelerating high-fidelity gates by mimicking the time evolution of a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian using fast-oscillating fields. This approach is contrasted with a numerically optimized gate designed using the Boulder Opal platform. The numerically optimized gate achieves higher fidelities while demonstrating robustness against errors similar to that of the effective counterdiabatic gate. The study serves as an example of the performance of analytic shortcut-to-adiabatic-inspired protocols compared to brute-force numerical optimization techniques for state-of-the-art quantum computing platforms. It stresses the important role played by constraints on the optimized pulses in time and in amplitude that are crucial in determining the quality of the optimization method.

TL;DR: A criterion for quantum non-Gaussian states using $g^{(2)}$ and $g^{(3)}$ is proposed and experimentally validated with a quantum dot single-photon source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum non-Gaussian states are essential for achieving quantum advantage in continuous variable systems and serve as a benchmark for advanced quantum light sources.

Method: An attenuation-resistant sufficient criterion for quantum non-Gaussian states based on the second- and third-order correlation functions, $g^{(2)}$ and $g^{(3)}$, is introduced.

Result: The experimental results show $√g^{(3)} + 3 √g^{(2)} = 0.174 (13)$, violating the classical bound, confirming quantum non-Gaussianity with high statistical significance.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates the quantum non-Gaussianity of the state produced by a quantum dot single-photon source, providing a robust and attenuation-resistant criterion for future quantum light sources.

Abstract: Quantum non-Gaussian states, which cannot be written as mixtures of Gaussian states, are necessary to achieve a quantum advantage in continuous variable systems. They represent an important benchmark for the realization of an advanced quantum light source, as they cannot be made by simple means such as displacement and squeezing. We introduce an attenuation-resistant sufficient criterion for quantum non-Gaussian states based on the second- and third-order correlation functions, $g^{(2)}$ and $g^{(3)}$. The general non-linear bound for classical mixtures of Gaussian states is $\sqrt{g^{(3)}} + 3 \sqrt{g^{(2)}} \geq 2$. Any mixture of Gaussian states must fulfill this inequality, thus, the violation of it represents a direct confirmation of quantum non-Gaussianity. We experimentally show the non-Gaussianity of the state produced by a quantum dot single-photon source, where we obtain $\sqrt{g^{(3)}} + 3 \sqrt{g^{(2)}} = 0.174 (13)$, which represents a statistical significance of more than $100$ standard deviations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of environmental drift degrading quantum operations without requiring computation halts for recalibration.

Method: The study unifies calibration with computation by repurposing error detection events in quantum error correction as a learning signal for a reinforcement learning agent to continuously adjust control parameters.

Result: Experimental demonstration on a superconducting processor showed a 3.5-fold improvement in logical error rate stability and scalability simulations up to distance-15 surface codes.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel paradigm where quantum computers can self-improve by learning from errors during computation, achieving stable and scalable performance.

Abstract: The promise of fault-tolerant quantum computing is challenged by environmental drift that relentlessly degrades the quality of quantum operations. The contemporary solution, halting the entire quantum computation for recalibration, is unsustainable for the long runtimes of the future algorithms. We address this challenge by unifying calibration with computation, granting the quantum error correction process a dual role: its error detection events are not only used to correct the logical quantum state, but are also repurposed as a learning signal, teaching a reinforcement learning agent to continuously steer the physical control parameters and stabilize the quantum system during the computation. We experimentally demonstrate this framework on a superconducting processor, improving the logical error rate stability of the surface code 3.5-fold against injected drift and pushing the performance beyond what is achievable with state-of-the-art traditional calibration and human-expert tuning. Simulations of surface codes up to distance-15 confirm the scalability of our method, revealing an optimization speed that is independent of the system size. This work thus enables a new paradigm: a quantum computer that learns to self-improve directly from its errors and never stops computing.

Abstract: Dynamical chaos in a periodically driven, dissipative soft impact oscillator is investigated in the quantum regime using the complex-number quantum Langevin equation (c-number QLE). The averaged system dynamics are analyzed through a comprehensive suite of time-series diagnostics, including bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, Fourier spectra, and the 0-1 test. Systematic variation of the wall position reveals a rich sequence of dynamical transitions and grazing bifurcations, progressing from periodic to multiperiodic motion and culminating in chaotic behavior.

TL;DR: FLASQ cost model improves fault-tolerant quantum algorithm optimization by better estimating spacetime costs, showing significant efficiency gains and practical challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics like circuit depth or T-count fail to capture critical overheads in fault-tolerant quantum computing, such as Clifford operations and routing, which are essential for optimizing early fault-tolerant devices.

Method: Proposing the FLuid Allocation of Surface code Qubits (FLASQ) cost model, which abstracts away routing complexity and captures overheads neglected by simpler metrics.

Result: FLASQ reduces the time and space required for quantum simulations by an order of magnitude and highlights challenges in implementing certain approaches (e.g., Hamming weight phasing) in early fault-tolerant settings.

Conclusion: The FLASQ cost model provides a more accurate and tractable way to estimate spacetime volume for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, better aligning algorithmic design with hardware realization costs.

Abstract: Holistic resource estimates are essential for guiding the development of fault-tolerant quantum algorithms and the computers they will run on. This is particularly true when we focus on highly-constrained early fault-tolerant devices. Many attempts to optimize algorithms for early fault-tolerance focus on simple metrics, such as the circuit depth or T-count. These metrics fail to capture critical overheads, such as the spacetime cost of Clifford operations and routing, or miss they key optimizations. We propose the FLuid Allocation of Surface code Qubits (FLASQ) cost model, tailored for architectures that use a two-dimensional lattice of qubits to implement the two-dimensional surface code. FLASQ abstracts away the complexity of routing by assuming that ancilla space and time can be fluidly rearranged, allowing for the tractable estimation of spacetime volume while still capturing important details neglected by simpler approaches. At the same time, it enforces constraints imposed by the circuit's measurement depth and the processor's reaction time. We apply FLASQ to analyze the cost of a standard two-dimensional lattice model simulation, finding that modern advances (such as magic state cultivation and the combination of quantum error correction and mitigation) reduce both the time and space required for this task by an order of magnitude compared with previous estimates. We also analyze the Hamming weight phasing approach to synthesizing parallel rotations, revealing that despite its low T-count, the overhead from imposing a 2D layout and from its use of additional ancilla qubits will make it challenging to benefit from in early fault-tolerance. We hope that the FLASQ cost model will help to better align early fault-tolerant algorithmic design with actual hardware realization costs without demanding excessive knowledge of quantum error correction from quantum algorithmists.

Result: 首次严格证明量子混沌动力学在早期恒定时间内可以生成投影集合，使其设计质量从初始的k=O(1)提升至k'=∞（Haar随机性）。此外，对于非GUE哈密顿量，结果同样适用。

Conclusion: 研究展示了混沌动力学下投影集合的设计质量提升现象，并通过理论证明和实际应用强调了其在量子热化中的重要性。这一发现为生成高质量设计提供了一种新机制，并对相关领域的理论研究具有推动作用。

Abstract: We study a counterintuitive property of 'conditioning' on the result of measuring a subsystem of a quantum state: such conditioning can boost design quality, at the cost of increased system size. We work in the setting of deep thermalization from many-body physics: starting from a bipartite state on a global system $(A,B)$ drawn from a $k$-design, we measure system $B$ in the computational basis, keep the outcome and examine the state that remains in system $A$, approximating the overall ensemble (the 'projected ensemble') by a $k'$-design. We ask: how does the design quality change due to this procedure, or how does $k'$ compare to $k$? We give the first rigorous example of unitary dynamics generating a state such that, projection at very early (constant) times can boost design randomness. These dynamics are those of quantum chaos, modeled by the evolution of a Hamiltonian drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We show that, even though a state generated by such dynamics at constant time only forms a $k=\mathcal{O}(1)$ design, the projected ensemble is Haar-random (or a $k'=\infty$ design) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. when $N_B=\infty$). This phenomenon persists even with weaker and more physically realistic assumptions; our results can be appropriately applied to non-GUE Hamiltonians that nevertheless show likely chaotic signatures in their eigenbases. Moreover, we show that with no assumption on how the global state was generated, a $k$-design experiences a degradation in design quality to $k' = \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$. This improves upon best prior results on the deep thermalization of designs. Together, our contributions argue for design boosting as a result of chaos and showcase a novel mechanism to generate good designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a comprehensive model that predicts time-frequency biphoton correlations and absolute generation rates for practical photon source design.

Method: An interaction-picture-based analytical model for biphoton generation in microring resonators, covering various geometries and pumping conditions.

Result: Under continuous-wave excitation, critical coupling maximizes single photon rates, while pulsed pumping requires overcoupling for optimal photon extraction, with a quantified tradeoff in spectral factorability.

Conclusion: The formalism presented is valuable for the practical design of integrated photon sources, combining flexibility with quantitative predictions tied to experimental parameters.

Abstract: We present a self-contained analytical model for biphoton generation in microring resonators. Encompassing both all-pass and add-drop geometries, identical and distinct pump and biphoton coupling coefficients, and continuous-wave and pulsed pumping, our interaction-picture-based approach reveals time-frequency biphoton correlations while also predicting absolute generation rates. Under continuous-wave excitation, we find critical coupling of both the pump and biphoton to maximize the rate of single photons extracted from the microring, whereas critical coupling of the pump but overcoupling of the biphoton maximize the two-photon rate. Under pulsed pumping, overcoupling of both pump and biphoton (to different degrees) maximizes photon extraction probabilities, albeit under a tradeoff with spectral factorability that we quantify via parameter scans over a range of coupler pairings. As a whole, our formalism should prove valuable for the practical design of integrated photon sources, merging a flexible and intuitive biphoton-centric depiction with quantitative predictions closely tied to experimental parameters.
