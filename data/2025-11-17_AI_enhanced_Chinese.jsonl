The perforation of the graphene layer forms interdigital arrays of graphene microribbons (GMRs) interconnected by graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. These GNR constrictions act as energy barriers for electrons and holes emitted from the GMRs and govern the inter-GMR thermionic current under an applied bias voltage. The doping and the voltage bias establish distinct electron and hole populations in adjacent GMRs. Peltier heating of these carriers within the GMRs increases their effective temperatures, thereby enhancing the inter-GMR current. The resulting positive feedback between carrier heating and current amplification can trigger an electrothermal breakdown, transforming a superlinear current-voltage dependence into an S-shaped characteristic exhibiting negative differential resistance.

To resolve this issue, we introduce a metric for characterizing the practical cost of preparing high-fidelity logical Bell pairs, link-limited volume (LLV), which is a circuit-volume metric incorporating both the cost of physical Bell pair consumption and the volume associated with local operations.

The Amoeba formulation addresses this challenge by computing the spectral potential rather than the spectrum itself. Based on the (strong) Szeg\u00f6 limit theorem and its topological generalization, this approach reduces the evaluation of the potential to an optimization problem involving the Ronkin function. However, while the generalized Szeg\u00f6 limit theorem is formally applicable in arbitrary dimensions, its implementation is limited to single-band systems, and its applicability to multiband systems remains unclear.

Here, we present a systematic and quantitative theoretical study of current-induced torques in Ti/FM and Cu/FM (FM = Co, Ni) bilayers using semi-realistic tight-binding models derived from ab initio electronic structures. We find that the torque in Ti/FM is larger for Ni than for Co, but this trend does not necessarily hold in Cu/FM, revealing that the FM dependence of OT is not universal but varies with the orbital current source. Moreover, the dependence of OT on NM thickness clearly indicates its NM bulk origin in both Ti- and Cu-based systems.

Since existing compilers such as the Qiskit-compiler and QR-Map (the state-of-art qubit reuse compiler) do not account for this variability, circuits with frequent MCM operations often experience substantial fidelity loss.\n  In thie paper, we propose MERA, a compilation framework that performs MCM-error-aware layout, routing, and scheduling.

Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typically requires achieving strong light-matter coupling, increasing the number of atoms fails to enhance antibunching. Here, we analyze the optical transmission properties of a quantum resonator that embeds a two-photon-coupled ensemble of emitters, combining an approximate analytical approach with full quantum numerical simulations. We show that when light and matter are coupled via a two-photon interaction, both single- and multi-photon blockade can benefit from a collective enhancement. We propose different driving schemes in which the second or third-order correlation functions are strongly suppressed with increasing atom number.

Despite its conceptual importance, however, explicit computations of relative entropy remain notoriously difficult. Thus far, results in closed form have only been obtained for ground states, coherent states, and, more recently, single-mode squeezed states. In this work, we extend the analysis to multi-mode squeezed states, imposing that the squeezing generators be local either in space or in spacetime, which results in a continuum of squeezed modes. We provide a detailed and self-contained analysis of such states for a free scalar quantum field on Minkowski spacetime, connecting also with older results on the essential self-adjointness of the Wick square, and showing that they lie in the folium of the Minkowski vacuum representation. Although the local squeezing is natural from a foundational standpoint, we uncover a severe incompatibility between locality and squeezing: the relative entropy between a locally squeezed state and the vacuum generally diverges, however small the squeezing is.

This allows us to design a digital-analog simulation protocol that avoids employing numerical optimization over a large parameter space at the preprocessing stage, minimizing computational resources and allowing for further scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u5b57-\u6a21\u62df\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57-\u6a21\u62df\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u8def\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4efb\u610f\u4e24\u4f53\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u4f0a\u8f9b\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5e7a\u6b63\u53d8\u6362\u4e4b\u548c\uff0c\u6240\u9700\u9879\u6570\u6700\u591a\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u907f\u514d\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6570\u5b57-\u6a21\u62df\u6a21\u62df\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u6240\u9700\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57-\u6a21\u62df\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\u6307\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9884\u5904\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

One of the most important is the quantum coherence of the emitted single photons, which can be compromised by fast dephasing and spectral diffusion. In hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), blue-emitting color centers (or B centers) are seen as favorable in this regard, in the light of prior studies mainly based on resonant excitation. Yet, their coherence properties in the more accessible regime of non-resonant excitation (or photoluminescence) has not been extensively characterized. Here, we investigate the coherence and spectral diffusion of the photoluminescence from a B center in the continuous wave regime using photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy. We determine that the emission lineshape consists in a homogeneous contribution, whose linewidth increases with the laser power, and which is broadened by spectral diffusion at a timescale of 10 to 100 microseconds. At low power and short time, the emission line is only a factor ~2 above the Fourier limit, while at long times, the inhomogeneous linewidth increases up to more than a gigahertz.

Employing the LHCb vertex locator as a case study we investigate a novel approach for charged particle track reconstruction. The algorithm hinges on minimizing an Ising-like Hamiltonian using matrix inversion. Solving this matrix inversion classically achieves reconstruction efficiencies akin to current state-of-the-art algorithms. Exploiting the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm for linear systems holds the promise of an exponential speedup in the number of input hits over its classical counterpart, contingent on the conditions of efficient quantum phase estimation (QPE) and effectively reading out the algorithm's output. This contribution builds on previous work by Nicotra et al and strives to fulfill these conditions and further streamlines the algorithm's circuit depth by a factor up to $10^4$. Our version of the HHL algorithm restricts the QPE precision to one bit, largely reducing circuit depth and addressing HHL's readout issue.
