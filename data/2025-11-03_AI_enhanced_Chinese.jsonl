The analysis of quantum Fisher information\nreveals that the PD regime significantly enhances precision for estimating the\nIsing interaction strength while simultaneously suppressing sensitivity to the\ntransverse magnetic field. Conversely, non-PD regimes are optimal for sensing\nthe transverse field. This filtering effect is robust for larger system sizes\nand is quantifiable using experimentally accessible observables, such as\nmagnetization and two-qubit correlations, via the classical Fisher information.\nOur work shows that distinct dynamical regimes in finite-size Floquet systems\ncan be harnessed for targeted quantum sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5468\u671f\u500d\u589e\u76f8\u5b9e\u73b0\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5468\u671f\u500d\u589e\u76f8\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a2a\u5411\u573aFloquet Ising\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u4e09\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5468\u671f\u500d\u589e\u76f8\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5468\u671f\u500d\u589e\u76f8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86Ising\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a2a\u5411\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u975e\u5468\u671f\u500d\u589e\u76f8\u5219\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6a2a\u5411\u78c1\u573a\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8Floquet\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7ecf\u5178Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

The two ingoing photons with\narbitrary frequency-polarization spectrum impinge onto the sphere along two\ndifferent directions and, as consequence of matter losses, their scattering\ninvolves the three independent processes where two, one and zero outgoing\nphotons survive. Non-collinearity of ingoing photons causes the existence of\ntwo different quantum paths they can follow upon scattering, this producing\ninterference effects in the detection of the above three processes which is\ngoverned by the wavepacket spectral symmetry. By exploiting rotational\ninvariance, we show that different classes of scattering geometries exist such\nthat the coincidence detection of the scattered photons shows perfect\nconstructive or destructive (Hong-Ou-Mandel) interference, both for symmetric\nand antisymmetric wavepackets. To assess the impact of matter dispersion/losses\non quantum interference effects accompanying photons detection, we analyze the\nscattering of narrow band two-photon wavepackets by high-index dielectric lossy\nspheres. We show that classical Mie resonance peaks, due to their Fano-like\ntraits, yield very strong constructive and destructive interference effects,\noccurring when the wavepacket carrier frequency matches the resonance frequency\nand side Fano dip frequency, respectively.

In\nthe 4-wave-mixing scheme, two lasers drive the system, coherently trapping the\nsystem in a dark ground-state and coupling a signal transition, that may be in\nthe terahertz, to an idler transition that may be in the optical. The\nphoton-mediated dipole-dipole interactions between emitters generate collective\nsuper-/subradiant dipolar modes, both on the signal and the idler transition.\nAs the array is cooperative with respect to the signal transition, an incident\nsignal photon can efficiently couple into the array and is admixed into dipolar\nidler modes by the drive. Under specific criticality conditions, this admixture\nis into a superradiant idler mode which primarily decays into a specific,\nhighly directional optical photon that propagates within the array plane.\nOutside of the array, this photon may then be coupled into existing quantum\ndevices for further processing.
