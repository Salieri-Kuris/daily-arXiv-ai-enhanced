Environmental noise also has a crucial role in controlling this class of hysteresis. The relaxational delay of the system's response towards the periodic drive manifests in the response function-field hysteresis loops. These hysteresis loops are generally symmetric in the range of the external force and the response function. Symmetry breaking is observed under extreme conditions of the noise strength, amplitude and frequency of the periodic force. This symmetric-asymmetric dynamic transition is interpreted in terms of the relevant order parameter defined for the system under study. In our present work, we importantly identify that it is possible to induce symmetry breaking in the hysteresis loops, and consequently to observe dynamic transitions under moderate conditions as well if appropriate asymmetry is implemented in the design of the underlying potential. We develop a quantitative understanding of the variation of the hysteresis loop area and the order parameter with respect to the degree of asymmetry in the potential. Our study suggests an ingenious way to get the desired outputs in the processes related to dynamic hysteresis by effectively controlling the asymmetry of the intrinsic potential governing the dynamics.

Moreover, in the quantum regime, they also have a profit in that they can be readily implemented through parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). From the perspective of learning, two indicators can be regarded as most crucial: expressivity and, for gradient-based methods, trainability. While a number of attempts have been made to quantify the expressivity and trainability of PQCs, clear efforts in the context of reinforcement learning have so far been lacking. Therefore, in this study, we newly define the notion of expressivity suited to reinforcement learning and demonstrate that the mutual information between action distribution and reward-signal distribution can, in certain respects, indicate information about both expressivity and trainability. Such research is valuable in that it provides an easy criterion for choosing among various PQCs employed in reinforcement learning, and further, enables the indirect estimation of learning progress even in black-box settings where the agent's achievement aligned with the episodes cannot be explicitly evaluated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2dPQCs\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aPQC\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ca\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u53d8\u4f53\uff08\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728PQCs\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u9002\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620PQCs\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9009\u62e9PQCs\u7684\u4fbf\u6377\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff08PQCs\uff09\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4fbf\u6377\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The stability and superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of carbon-boron clathrates XYB6C6, whose metal atoms have an average oxidation state of +1.5, have long remained under debate. At this oxidation state, some combinations (e.g., RbSrB6C6) are dynamically stable, whereas others (e.g., RbPbB6C6) are not. Using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation combined with machine learning, we find that the anharmonicity originates primarily from guest metal atoms. For comparison, we find that quantum fluctuations have negligible influence on SrB3C3, but remove the lattice instability of RbPbB6C6. The predicted Tc of RbPbB6C6 (88 K) is nearly twice that of SrB3C3. Moreover, RbPbB6C6 exhibits two-gap superconductivity due to the higher C/B ratio in the density of states at the Fermi level compared to SrB3C3, weakening the sp3 hybridization.

The framework supports a comprehensive suite of state-of-the-art methods, including multiplexer-based loaders, quantum read-only memory (QROM) constructions, sparse encodings, matrix product states (MPS), Fourier series loaders (FSL), and Walsh transform-based diagonal operators.

Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion.

Of particular interest for near-term demonstrations of quantum computational advantage are analog quantum simulations, which employ analog controls instead of digitized gates. Most analog quantum simulations to date, however, have been performed using qubit-based processors, despite the fact that many physical systems are more naturally represented in terms of qudits (i.e., $d$-level systems). Motivated by this, we present an experimental realization of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using an analog simulator based on a single superconducting transmon qudit with up to $d = 9$ levels. This is accomplished by moving to a rotated frame in which evolution under any time-dependent local field and one-axis twisting can be realized by the application of multiple simultaneous drives.

Final doctoral thesis version containing modifications suggested by the referees: Marco G. Genoni, Madalin Guta, and Lukasz Cywinski", "summary": "Quantum entanglement, in the form of spin squeezing, is known to improve the sensitivity of atomic sensors to static or slowly varying fields. Sensing transient events presents a distinct challenge, requires different analysis tools, and has not been shown to benefit from entanglement in practically important scenarios such as spin-precession magnetometry. To address this, we apply concepts from continuous quantum measurements and estimation theory to optical atomic magnetometers, aiming to accurately model these devices, interpret their measurement data, control their dynamics, and achieve optimal sensitivity. Quantifying this optimal performance requires determining a fundamental quantum limit on sensitivity. We derive this limit, imposed by noise, and show that it scales at best linearly with sensing time and atom number N, ruling out any super-classical scaling. This limit is independent of the initial state, measurement, estimator, and measurement-based feedback, and depends only on the decoherence model and the strength of field fluctuations. Thus, finding an estimator that attains this bound proves the sensing strategy optimal. To approach this limit, we develop a quantum dynamical model scalable with N, based on a co-moving Gaussian approximation of the stochastic master equation, which includes measurement backaction and decoherence. This enables a real-time estimation and control architecture integrating an extended Kalman filter with a linear quadratic regulator. Simulating the magnetometer with our model and EKF+LQR strategy shows that quantum-limited tracking of constant and fluctuating fields is within reach of current atomic magnetometers. Our sensing strategy can also track biologically relevant signals, such as heartbeat-like waveforms, and drive the atomic ensemble into an entangled state, even when the measurement record is used for feedback but later discarded.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u77ac\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f20\u611f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u539f\u5b50\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u9650\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u77ac\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u65cb\u8fdb\u52a8\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\uff09\u4f20\u611f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u9650\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5171\u79fb\u52a8\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u8c03\u8282\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u9650\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4ec5\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u573a\u6ce2\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u6570N\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6052\u5b9a\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u573a\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u9650\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u5fc3\u8df3\u6ce2\u5f62\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u867d\u7136\u5728\u9759\u6001\u6216\u7f13\u6162\u53d8\u5316\u573a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u77ac\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u4e2d\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u793a\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5149\u539f\u5b50\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u9650\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u539f\u5b50\u78c1\u529b\u8ba1\u8fbe\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u9650\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

However, fast measurements with the required resolution are difficult to realize. As a solution, we introduce extreme energy entanglement between the photons undergoing interference. Using a flux probing analysis technique, we recover vibrational signals with frequencies as high as 21 kHz. Along with validating nanometer-scale precision and accuracy, we observe a significant quantum advantage when measuring in the presence of loss and background.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5f3a\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea0\u7f20\u5149\u5b50\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5feb\u901f\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u53cc\u5149\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u7684\u6297\u635f\u8017\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5feb\u901f\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u6240\u9700\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5149\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u6781\u5f3a\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u901a\u91cf\u63a2\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u9891\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe21kHz\u7684\u632f\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe21kHz\u7684\u632f\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u635f\u5931\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}
