Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A spectral solver for viscoelastic structures under oscillary flow, tested in QCM and force spectroscopy, shows high accuracy and potential for new analytical routes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient spectral solver for analyzing the linear response of viscoelastic structures under oscillatory flow, applicable to scenarios like QCM and atomic force microscopy.

Method: The scheme uses a fast spectral solver coupling oscillatory Stokes equations with viscoelastic structures, solved via hydrodynamic mobility matrix or iterative fluid-structure coupling using Anderson acceleration. It employs a spectral-in-space-and-time method for fluid flow.

Result: The solver shows excellent agreement with analytical, numerical, and experimental results in tests involving QCM of spheres and force spectroscopy of microparticles near boundaries.

Conclusion: The scheme opens new routes in force spectroscopy and QCM analyses of soft objects by providing excellent agreement with analytical, numerical, and experimental results.

Abstract: We present a fast spectral solver for the linear response of viscoelastic structures under oscillatory flow either in free space or close to a flat moving wall. The scheme works in the frequency domain (using phasors) and couples the oscillatory Stokes equation with rigid or flexible structures, modeled by viscoelastic networks of immersed boundary kernels. The fluid-structure coupling can be solved by two routes. One route calculates the hydrodynamic mobility matrix required to solve the equation for the structure deformation rate in matrix form. The second route iteratively solves the coupled fluid-structure equations: fluid-induced forces on the structures create a tension field which is then transferred to the fluid, until convergence. The resulting fixed-point problem is solved iteratively using the Anderson acceleration method. The mobility route is optimal when dealing with one or few structures, while the iterative scheme is preferred for denser dispersions. In any case, the flow resulting from the body forces is solved by a recently developed scheme [J. Fluid. Mech. 1010 A57, 2025] which is spectral in space and time and deals with doubly periodic open domains (either free-space or wall-bounded) where meshing is restricted to the region of interest around the structures. We test the present scheme in two applied contexts: quartz-crystal-microbalance (QCM) of spheres, suspended, adsorbed or tethered to viscoelastic linkers; and force spectroscopy (via atomic force microscopy) reproducing the power spectra of vibrating microparticles near a solid boundary. In all cases, comparisons with analytical, numerical and experimental results show excellent agreement. We conclude by discussing new routes the scheme opens in force spectroscopy and QCM analyses of soft objects.

*Shreyashi Sinha,Shantanu Pathak,Saswata Bhattacharya,Sujit Manna*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A technique for exfoliating ultrathin topological insulator flakes enabled clear observation of quantum well states, supported by spectroscopy and theory, advancing quantum research and device applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of reliably fabricating pristine, high-quality two-dimensional layers suitable for atomic-scale spectroscopy has hindered the study of their emergent quantum states and device-relevant functionalities. The study aims to address this challenge.

Method: A controlled mechanical exfoliation technique for bulk 3D topological insulators was used to obtain atomically clean ultrathin flakes. Atomically resolved scanning probe microscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy were employed to analyze the flakes, and high-resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy was used to observe quantum well states.

Result: Quantum well states (QWS) of Dirac electrons were clearly resolved, with a strong correlation between Raman intensity and film thickness observed. The standard phase accumulation model accurately described QWS, and band structure calculations showed agreement with density functional theory. QWS remained robust against defect scattering.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for exploring diverse quantum phenomena and device applications through quantum confinement, surface-state engineering, and tunable topological phases.

Abstract: We present a controlled mechanical exfoliation technique for bulk 3D topological insulators that yields atomically clean ultrathin flakes, enabling quantum well states (QWS) of Dirac electrons to be clearly resolved. Achieving reliable fabrication of pristine, high-quality two-dimensional layers suitable for atomic-scale spectroscopy remains a central experimental challenge in uncovering their emergent quantum states and realizing device-relevant functionalities. Atomically resolved scanning probe microscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy reveal a strong correlation between Raman intensity and film thickness, enabling rapid identification of (Bi\textsubscript{0.1}Sb\textsubscript{0.9})\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{3} flakes with desired thickness. High resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy on exfoliated flakes with atomically flat terraces reveals QWS, driven by quantum confinement of Dirac electrons. This effect is rarely observed due to the electrons resistance to electrostatic confinement caused by Klein tunneling. The standard phase accumulation model accurately captures the characteristics of QWS and extracts the electronic band dispersion, showing excellent agreement with density functional theory calculations. Band structure calculation reveals that with increasing quantum-layer thickness, the interlayer coupling enhances the electronic dispersion, progressively reducing subband splitting and giving rise to bulk-like continuous bands. Spatially resolved spectroscopy around surface defects further confirms that QWS of Dirac electrons in topological insulators remains robust against defect scattering. This work paves the way for exploring diverse quantum phenomena and device applications through quantum confinement, surface-state engineering, and tunable topological phases.

### [3] [Topological surface-state destruction via trivializing proximity effect: Lattice localization despite continuum criticality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19596)
*Arthur Niwazuki,Matthew S. Foster*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Surface states in 3D topological insulators are fragile to disorder and hybridization with trivial bands, while continuum models show complex localization behavior, indicating a gap between lattice and continuum theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the localizability of 3D topological insulators and superconductors, particularly focusing on the stability of surface states under weak disorder and hybridization with trivial bands.

Method: Numerical investigation of the stability of surface states in the 3D class-CI topological lattice model and effective 2D class-CI continuum Dirac theories, including the chiral limit of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene.

Result: Surface states in the bulk class-CI lattice model are fragile and can be Anderson localized by weak disorder and trivializing proximity effects. In contrast, continuum models show Anderson localization for weak disorder but restored criticality for stronger disorder.

Conclusion: Effective continuum field theories fail to fully capture the surface-state physics in localizable topological phases, as demonstrated by the contrasting behaviors of surface states in lattice models versus continuum theories.

Abstract: In a significant conceptual revision to the tenfold classification scheme for topological insulators and superconductors, it was recently demonstrated that most three-dimensional (3D) classes are simultaneously "localizable" in two distinct, but intricately connected ways: (1) There is no obstruction to Wannier localization of all bulk eigenstates, and (2) Almost all surface states can be Anderson localized by arbitrarily weak symmetry-preserving quenched disorder. Here we consider the localizable class CI in 3D, and numerically investigate the stability of surface states. We demonstrate that surface states of a bulk class-CI topological lattice model are fragile in that they can be Anderson localized by the combination of weak quenched randomness and hybridization with an additional trivial 2D band (a trivializing proximity effect, TPE). With the TPE, stronger disorder is more destructive to the surface states of the bulk lattice model. By contrast, without additional bands the surface states remain extended, exhibiting robust spectrum-wide quantum criticality. We also investigate the fragility of surface states in effective 2D class-CI continuum Dirac theories, including the chiral limit of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene. Although the continuum models exhibit signs of Anderson localization near gap edges for weak disorder, stronger disorder instead appears to heal the surface, restoring criticality whilst filling in spectral energy gaps. Our results provide further evidence that effective continuum field theories fail to capture key aspects of surface-state physics in localizable topological phases.

Motivation: 探索绝缘磁性材料中磁子的隐藏贝里曲率及其在垂直输运中的表现，填补了磁子输运领域中未被研究的理论和实验空白。

Method: 研究结合了半经典框架和玻尔兹曼输运理论，利用线性自旋波理论计算了HMBC，并通过自旋模型（如BHC和CrX3体系）进行了数值估计。

Result: 发现HMBC会导致线性和非线性垂直磁子输运，其系数分别与总HMBC及其偶极矩相关。在BHC和CrX3体系中，分别展现了对称性破缺引起的输运特征。

Conclusion: 本文预测了绝缘性准二维磁体中的磁子隐藏贝里曲率（HMBC）及其引起的垂直磁子输运（VMT），并通过理论和实验验证了其在线性和非线性输运中的特征。研究展示了HMBC在多种磁性体系中的存在及其对实验的直接影响。

Abstract: We predict an in-plane, or hidden, Berry curvature (BC) for magnons in electrically insulating quasi-2D magnets and demonstrate that the hidden magnon Berry curvature (HMBC) gives rise to a previously unrecognized form of vertical, out-of-plane, magnon transport. Combining a semiclassical framework with Boltzmann transport theory, we show that the vertical magnon transport (VMT) currents respond both linearly and nonlinearly to the in-plane gradients of magnetic field and temperature. The linear transport coefficients are tied to the total hidden magnon BC, while the nonlinear (second-order) coefficients for the magnetic field and temperature gradients are determined by the hidden magnon BC dipole and the hidden extended magnon BC dipole, respectively. Using linear spin-wave theory, we find that the hidden magnon BC over the Brillouin zone is given by the expectation value of a pseudo-${\cal Z}$ operator, representing vertical displacements, evaluated in the space of paraunitary matrices that diagonalize the magnon Hamiltonian. We estimate VMT in spin models of realistic magnets with ferro- and antiferromagnetic order, including the buckled honeycomb (BHC) lattice and bilayer Chromium trihalide (CrX$_3$; X = Cl, Br, I) systems. In BHC, both linear and nonlinear VMT arise when time-reversal symmetry is broken by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. In CrX$_3$ systems, the nonlinear coefficients dominate, while the linear responses vanish due to time-reversal symmetry. Both systems exhibit distinctive features across a broad range of temperatures and parameters. Therefore, our prediction of VMT and its characteristic signatures is directly testable in present-day magnonic experiments, especially in atomically thin, few-layered van der Waals magnets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to explore and enhance the nonlinear optical response of graphene, specifically targeting the efficiency of SHG, by utilizing the resonant characteristics of SPPs.

Method: The study employs a theoretical examination of SHG in a graphene monolayer within an ATR configuration, focusing on the role of SPPs and field confinement.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that SPP excitation and graphene's electronic properties synergistically amplify SHG efficiency due to strong field confinement and resonant interactions.

Conclusion: This paper concludes that integrating graphene within an ATR configuration significantly enhances the efficiency of second-harmonic generation (SHG) by leveraging the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) and the unique electronic properties of graphene.

Abstract: In this paper we present a theoretical examination of second-harmonic generation (SHG) in a graphene monolayer integrated within an attenuated total internal reflection (ATR) configuration. By embedding graphene in this optical setup, we explore the enhancement in the nonlinear optical response, particularly focusing on the efficiency of SHG. Our analysis reveals that the excitation of surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) plays a central role in significantly boosting the efficiency of SHG. The unique electronic properties of graphene, combined with the resonant characteristics of SPPs, create a synergistic effect that amplifies the nonlinear optical signals. This enhancement is attributed to the strong field confinement and the resonant nature of SPPs, which effectively increase the interaction between the incident light and the graphene monolayer. Furthermore, we analyze the underlying mechanisms that govern this process, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework that elucidates the interplay between graphene's electronic structure and the optical fields. Our findings suggest that the ATR scheme not only facilitates the excitation of SPPs but also optimizes the conditions for SHG.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore new physics beyond conventional Floquet theory by using quantum optimal control to design modulation profiles, aiming to achieve enhanced topological transport properties and high fidelity in non-equilibrium quantum states.

Method: The study leverages quantum optimal control techniques to design Floquet amplitude modulation profiles, enabling the discovery of a new regime of topological transport. This approach achieves high fidelity and ultrahigh anomalous Hall conductivities in non-equilibrium quantum states.

Result: The results show ultrahigh time-averaged anomalous Hall conductivities, reaching up to seventy times the expected values from the Chern number of the targeted Floquet state. High fidelity (>99%) is achieved at the topological energy gap closing point, a twenty-fold improvement over standard monotonic approaches.

Conclusion: This paper demonstrates that quantum optimal control techniques can uncover fundamentally new regimes of topological transport in ultrafast quantum matter experiments. By designing Floquet amplitude modulation profiles, the study achieves ultrahigh anomalous Hall conductivities and high fidelity at topological energy gap closing points, surpassing conventional methods. The findings open new possibilities for quantum technologies and topological device applications.

Abstract: Ultrafast quantum matter experiments have validated predictions from Floquet theory - notably, the dynamical modification of the electronic band structure and the light-induced anomalous Hall effect, via monotonic modulation of the driving amplitude. Here, we demonstrate how new physics is uncovered by leveraging quantum optimal control techniques to design Floquet amplitude modulation profiles. We discover a fundamentally different regime of topological transport, whereby the optimal oscillatory preparation protocol functions as a non-adiabatic topological pump: as a result, ultrahigh time-averaged anomalous Hall conductivities emerge, that reach up to around seventy times the values one would expect from the Chern number of the targeted Floquet state. The optimal protocols achieve >99% fidelity at the topological energy gap closing point - a twenty-fold improvement over standard monotonic approaches in as little as ten Floquet cycles - while unexpectedly generating the predicted ultrahigh conductivities. Our findings demonstrate that optimally prepared non-equilibrium quantum states can access transport regimes not achievable in the corresponding equilibrium system or even by applying conventional Floquet approaches, opening new avenues for ultrafast quantum technologies and topological device applications.

TL;DR: Study shows size-dependent carrier density in graphene Hall devices, with machine learning identifying ~360 µm as the optimal channel width for QHRS arrays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how device dimensions impact the performance of miniaturized quantum Hall resistance standards (QHRS) using epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide.

Method: The study utilized Fermi velocity measurements, ARPES analysis, and machine learning with limited data to analyze the scale-dependent carrier density in graphene Hall devices and optimize device geometry.

Result: A pronounced scale-dependent carrier density was observed, with carrier density decreasing under electron doping and increasing under hole doping as channel width (Wd) varied, most significantly for Wd < 400 µm. This directly affects the magnetic field required for quantization.

Conclusion: This study identifies that a channel width of ~360 µm optimally balances resistance uncertainty and on-chip integration density, providing key insights for designing high-performance, miniaturized graphene-based QHRS arrays.

Abstract: The miniaturization of quantum Hall resistance standards (QHRS) using epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide necessitates understanding how device dimensions impact performance. This study reveals a pronounced scale-dependent carrier density in graphene Hall devices: under electron doping, carrier density decreases with increasing channel width (Wd), while the opposite occurs under hole doping. This phenomenon, most significant for Wd less than 400 um, directly influences the onset of magnetic field required for quantization. Fermi velocity measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) analysis indicate that band structure modifications and electron-electron interactions underlie this size dependence. Utilizing machine learning with limited data, we optimized the device geometry, identifying a channel width of ~360 um as the optimal balance between resistance uncertainty and on-chip integration density. This work provides key insights for designing high-performance, miniaturized graphene-based QHRS arrays.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for an efficient and accurate model for describing valley splittings and related phenomena in Si/SiGe heterostructures for spin qubits.

Method: Implementation of inter-valley potentials in the two bands k.p model for silicon valleys, validated against atomistic tight-binding calculations.

Result: The model reproduces valley splittings and captures valley-orbit mixing, providing correct inter-valley dipole matrix elements for qubit manipulation and dephasing analysis.

Conclusion: The two bands k.p model is shown to be an efficient tool for simulating valley physics in Si/SiGe heterostructures, with applications extending beyond spin qubits.

Abstract: We discuss the choice and implementation of inter-valley potentials in the so-called two bands k.p model for the opposite X, Y or Z valleys of silicon. We focus on the description of valley splittings in Si/SiGe heterostructures for spin qubits, with a particular attention to alloy disorder. We demonstrate that the two bands k.p model reproduces the valley splittings of atomistic tight-binding calculations in relevant heterostructures (SiGe spikes, wiggle wells...), yet at a much lower cost. We show that the model also captures the effects of valley-orbit mixing and yields the correct inter-valley dipole matrix elements that characterize manipulation, dephasing and relaxation in spin/valley qubits. We simulate a realistic Si/SiGe spin qubit device as an illustration, and discuss electron-phonon interactions in the two bands k.p model. Beyond spin qubits, this model enables efficient simulations of SiGe heterostructure devices where spin and valley physics are relevant.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates cQED techniques for high-resolution spectroscopy of few-carrier states in bilayer graphene quantum dots, revealing spin and valley states critical for qubit applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bilayer graphene is a promising material for solid-state qubits, but a fundamental understanding of confined electronic systems is needed to implement such qubits, especially for states involving exchange interactions between particles.

Method: Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques were used to achieve high energy resolution, enabling the spectroscopy of few-carrier states in bilayer graphene quantum dots. A superconducting high-impedance resonator was capacitively coupled to the double quantum dot for measurements.

Result: The spectroscopy revealed dispersive features of two and three electron states, including the detection of Pauli spin and valley blockade and the characterization of the spin-orbit gap at zero magnetic field.

Conclusion: The results deepen our understanding of few-carrier spin and valley states in bilayer graphene quantum dots and demonstrate that cQED techniques are a powerful state-selective probe for semiconductor nanostructures.

Abstract: Bilayer graphene is a maturing material platform for gate-defined quantum dots that hosts long-lived spin and valley states. Implementing solid-state qubits in bilayer graphene requires a fundamental understanding of such confined electronic systems. In particular, states of two and three carriers, for which the exchange interaction between particles plays a crucial role, are a cornerstone for qubit readout and manipulation. Here we report on the spectroscopy of few-carrier states in bilayer graphene quantum dots, using circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques that offer substantially improved energy resolution compared to standard transport techniques. Measurements using a superconducting high-impedance resonator capacitively coupled to the double quantum dot reveal dispersive features of two and three electron states, enabling the detection of Pauli spin and valley blockade and the characterization of the spin-orbit gap at zero magnetic field.

*Akash Dey*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Study shows contrasting nonlinear Hall responses in Dirac semimetals, with enhanced second-order response in single-node phases and larger third-order response in line-node phases due to Berry curvature effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how nonlinear Hall responses, specifically second and third-order responses, vary in different phases of Dirac semimetals (single-node, double-node, and line-node) due to quantum geometry effects.

Method: Investigating quantum geometry-driven second and third-order nonlinear responses in a tunable two-dimensional Dirac semimetal with time-reversal symmetry.

Result: The second-order Hall response is enhanced in single-node semimetals and vanishes in line-node semimetals, while the third-order response is significantly larger in line-node semimetals, particularly near the band edge.

Conclusion: The nonlinear Hall responses in two-dimensional Dirac materials are significantly influenced by the Berry curvature dipole and Berry connection polarizability, with distinct behaviors observed in single-node, double-node, and line-node semimetallic phases.

Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear Hall responses in tunable two-dimensional Dirac materials. In particular, we study quantum geometry-driven second and third order non-linear responses in a time-reversal symmetric Dirac semimetal that can host single, double and line nodes depending on the model parameters. We find that the second-order Hall response (SOHE), which originates from the Berry curvature dipole, is enhanced in the single-node semimetallic phase as compared to the double node case when inversion symmetry is broken. In contrast, the SOHE vanishes in the nodal line semimetal as the inversion symmetry retains. Notably, the third-order Hall response due to Berry connection polarizabilty becomes much larger in the line-node Dirac semimetal, especially when the Fermi energy lies near the band edge, than in the single- and double-node Dirac semimetals. The reason for this contrasting behavior is attributed to the distinct distribution of the Berry connection polarizability in the Brillouin zone.

*Aamna Ahmed,Mónica Benito,Beatriz Pérez-González*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: High-frequency driving transforms a diamond chain's flat bands, enabling tunable quasi-flat bands and entanglement control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how periodic driving can modify flat-band lattices and enable specific features like controlled tunneling and entanglement.

Method: High-frequency periodic driving transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain into one with two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band at E=0.

Result: The system exhibits drive-induced tunneling, charge oscillations, and generates experimentally accessible two-particle entanglement.

Conclusion: The driven diamond chain provides a versatile platform for manipulating quantum correlations, linking spectral fine structure with dynamical entanglement.

Abstract: Flat-band lattices hosting compact localized states are highly sensitive to external modulation, and the tailored design of a perturbation to imprint specific features becomes relevant. Here we show that periodic driving in the high-frequency regime transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain into one featuring two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band pinned at $E=0$. The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries. This feature can be exploited to generate two-particle entanglement that is directly accessible experimentally. The resulting drive-engineered quasi-flat bands thus provide a versatile platform for manipulating quantum correlations, revealing a direct link between spectral fine structure and dynamical entanglement.

TL;DR: Landau level transitions and Hall angles strongly modulate PSHE in WTe2, revealing new insights into spin-orbit interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore nanoscale manipulation and steering of magneto-optical transport in two-dimensional atomic systems through Landau level engineered photonic spin Hall effect.

Method: Theoretical investigation of photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) modulated by Landau level transitions δn = -2, 0, +2 in monolayer WTe2.

Result: PSHE behavior varies significantly with Landau level transitions and Hall angles, with a giant PSHE observed at specific transitions and enhanced effects near-zero Hall angles.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the significant influence of Landau level transitions and Hall angles on the photonic spin Hall effect, providing insights into spin-orbit interactions in time-reversal symmetry breaking systems.

Abstract: Landau level (LL) engineered photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) holds great promise for nanoscale manipulation and steering of magneto-optical transport in two-dimensional atomic systems. Herein, we theoretically investigate PSHE modulated by LL transitions δn = n'-n =-2, 0, +2 (where n and n' indicate the LL indexes of valence and conduction bands, respectively) in monolayer WTe2. Results show that PSHE tuned by δn =-2, 0, +2 has completely different dependent behaviors on LLs, incident angle of incident photons, and magnetic induction intensity. These discrepancies are ascribed to Hall-conductivity-incurred Hall angle Θ because the variation tendency of photonic spin Hall shifts is similar to that of Θ with changing the LL index. Giant PSHE with the largest in-plane displacement of more than 400 times of incident wavelength is obtained at the transition |n=55>->|n'=57>. Remarkably enhanced PSHE occurs at near-zero Hall angles. In-plane and transverse spin-dependent displacements give their respective extremum values at the same incident angles when the Θ is near to zero, and their incident-angle deviation will become larger and larger as the |Θ| increases. This unambiguously confirms the strong influence of Hall angle in the PSHE, shedding important insights into the fundamental properties of spin-orbit interaction of light in time-reversal symmetry breaking quantum systems.

Result: Observation of robust, reversible U-shaped conductance variations with interelectrode distance, attributed to destructive quantum interference caused by helical backbone deformation and modifications at the metal-molecule interface.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the central role of helical geometry and contact properties in the electromechanical response of molecular springs, offering insights for designing functional electromechanical devices.

Abstract: Single-molecule junctions represent electromechanical systems at the edge of device miniaturization. Despite extensive studies on the interplay between mechanical manipulation and electron transport in molecular junctions, a thorough understanding of conducting molecular springs remains elusive. Here, we investigate the impact of mechanical elongation and compression on the electron transport and electronic structure of helicene-based spring-like single-molecule junctions, utilizing 2,2'-dithiol-[6]helicene and thioacetyl-[13]helicene molecules bridging two gold electrodes. We observe robust, reversible U-shaped conductance variations with interelectrode distance. Ab-initio electronic structure and quantum transport calculations reveal that this behavior stems from destructive quantum interference, induced mainly by modifications of the coupling at the metal-molecule interface as a peculiar outcome of the helical backbone deformation. These findings highlight the central role of the helical geometry in combination with contact properties in the electromechanical response of conducting molecular springs, offering insights for designing functional electromechanical devices that leverage similar mechanisms.

TL;DR: Study reveals distinct electronic origins for SHE (Gd 5d) and SAHE (FeCo 3d) in GdFeCo ferrimagnet, showing their torque signs remain consistent across the magnetisation compensation point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the spin current symmetries in GdFeCo ferrimagnet and identify sublattice contributions across a broad temperature range, including the magnetisation compensation point.

Method: Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy to separate contributions of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin anomalous Hall effect (SAHE).

Result: The torques from SHE and SAHE retain their sign across the magnetisation compensation temperature, with SAHE-driven damping-like torque having the opposite sign to SHE-driven term.

Conclusion: Ferrimagnetic spin currents can generate spin torques in adjacent layers or within the ferrimagnet itself, clarifying the interplay between sublattices in spin transport.

Abstract: Ferrimagnets, composed of antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic sublattices whose net magnetisation can be tuned by temperature, offer a unique platform for probing the symmetry of the spin currents they generate and for identifying the sublattice contributions to these currents. Here, we investigate the spin current symmetries produced by GdFeCo ferrimagnet at a fixed concentration and across a broad temperature range, including the magnetisation compensation point. Using complementary techniques based on spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we separate the contributions of the spin Hall effect (SHE) and the spin anomalous Hall effect (SAHE). We show that the torques arising from both mechanisms retain their sign across the magnetisation compensation temperature, and that the SAHE-driven damping-like torque has the opposite sign to the SHE-driven term. We suggest that both effects originates from distinct electronic subsystems: the SHE emerging from Gd 5d electrons, and the SAHE from FeCo 3d electrons. Consequently, the SHE sign remains insensitive to the magnetisation state, whereas the SAHE sign does not invert at compensation, reproducing our observations. Together, these insights clarify the interplay between sublattices in ferrimagnetic spin transport and highlight the potential of ferrimagnetic spin currents to generate spin torques in adjacent layers or within the ferrimagnet itself.

TL;DR: Nanometre-resolution imaging of excitons in twisted bilayer MoS₂ reveals site-selective confinement, validated by a theoretical model, enabling future excitonic lattice engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal was to directly image confined excitonic species within a moiré unit cell, addressing the challenge of resolving nanometre-scale variations that spatially averaged far-field signals cannot achieve.

Method: Room-temperature photocurrent atomic force microscopy was used to image excitons across the moiré of a 2° twisted bilayer MoS₂ with nanometre resolution.

Result: Direct and indirect excitons were found to localize at different stacking registries of the moiré, with contrast governed by alignment between site-selective generation and confinement minima. A Wannier-based moiré-exciton model validated the measured energies and localization.

Conclusion: The study successfully imaged excitons with nanometre resolution in a twisted bilayer MoS₂, demonstrating site-selective confinement of direct and indirect excitons. This provides a device-compatible method for engineering excitonic lattices in van der Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: Twisted two-dimensional semiconductors generate a moiré landscape that confines excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) into programmable lattices, offering routes to efficient light sources, sensing, and room-temperature information processing. However, direct real-space imaging of confined excitonic species within a moiré unit cell remains challenging; existing claims are inferred from spatially averaged far-field signals that are intrinsically insufficient to resolve nanometre-scale variations. Here, we imaged excitons across the moiré of a 2$^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer MoS$_2$ with nanometre resolution using room-temperature photocurrent atomic force microscopy. We directly resolved site-selective confinement: direct and indirect excitons localize at different stacking registries of the moiré, with contrast governed by alignment between site-selective generation and confinement minima. A Wannier-based moiré-exciton model reproduces the measured energies and the moiré-induced localization of the exciton wavefunction. These species-specific, unit-cell-resolved measurements constrain microscopic models of moiré excitons, provide benchmarks for excitonic order, and establish a device-compatible route to engineering excitonic lattices in van der Waals heterostructures.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: New probabilistic bounds for generating finite nilpotent groups improve efficiency in quantum algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of probabilistic algorithms, particularly in quantum computing, by reducing the number of elements needed for group generation.

Method: The authors prove two bounds: one based on group rank and another on group chain length, demonstrating their tightness through analysis.

Result: The bounds $φ_k(G) ≥ 1 - ε$ are shown to hold for $k ≥ ρ(G) + ⌈ łog_2(2/ε) ⌉$ and $k ≥ Λ(G) + ⌈ łog_2(1/ε) ⌉$, outperforming previous requirements.

Conclusion: The paper establishes nearly tight probabilistic bounds on the number of elements required to generate finite nilpotent groups, significantly sharpening previous results.

Abstract: This work establishes a new probabilistic bound on the number of elements to generate finite nilpotent groups. Let $\varphi_k(G)$ denote the probability that $k$ random elements generate a finite nilpotent group $G$. For any $0 < ε< 1$, we prove that $\varphi_k(G) \ge 1 - ε$ if $k \ge \operatorname{rank}(G) + \lceil \log_2(2/ε) \rceil$ (a bound based on the group rank) or if $k \ge \operatorname{len}(G) + \lceil \log_2(1/ε) \rceil$ (a bound based on the group chain length). Moreover, these bounds are shown to be nearly tight. Both bounds sharpen the previously known requirement of $k \ge \lceil \log_2 |G| + \log_2(1/ε) \rceil + 2$. Our results provide a foundational tool for analyzing probabilistic algorithms, enabling a better estimation of the iteration count for the finite Abelian hidden subgroup problem (AHSP) standard quantum algorithm and a reduction in the circuit repetitions required by Regev's factoring algorithm.

That includes bound calculation, convergence metrics and optimality guarantee to the quantum optimization based algorithm, which makes our method directly comparable to classical methods. Key aspects of the proposed algorithm are (i) encapsulation of the quantum optimization method, (ii) utilization of noisy samples for problem reduction, (iii) classical approximation based bound calculation, (iv) branch and bound traits like gap-based stopping criterion and monotonic increase in solution quality, (v) integrated composition of many different solutions that can be improved individually. We show numerical results on set partitioning problem instances and provide many details about the characteristics of the different steps of the algorithm.

TL;DR: SPARTA provides a practical, statistically rigorous method to navigate barren plateaus in quantum optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the trainability crisis in variational quantum algorithms caused by barren plateaus, which render optimization exponentially difficult.

Method: SPARTA combines a χ²-calibrated sequential test, probabilistic trust-region exploration, and optimal exploitation phase to navigate barren plateaus.

Result: Geometric bounds on plateau exit times, linear convergence in informative basins, and enhanced test power without compromising statistical calibration.

Conclusion: SPARTA is the first measurement-frugal scheduler with explicit, anytime-valid risk control for quantum optimization, integrating rigorous statistical methods to address barren plateaus and achieve optimal convergence.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms face a fundamental trainability crisis: barren plateaus render optimization exponentially difficult as system size grows. While recent Lie algebraic theory precisely characterizes when and why these plateaus occur, no practical optimization method exists with finite-sample guarantees for navigating them. We present the sequential plateau-adaptive regime-testing algorithm (SPARTA), the first measurement-frugal scheduler that provides explicit, anytime-valid risk control for quantum optimization. Our approach integrates three components with rigorous statistical foundations: (i) a $χ^2$-calibrated sequential test that distinguishes barren plateaus from informative regions using likelihood-ratio supermartingales; (ii) a probabilistic trust-region exploration strategy with one-sided acceptance to prevent false improvements under shot noise; and (iii) a theoretically-optimal exploitation phase that achieves the best attainable convergence rate. We prove geometric bounds on plateau exit times, linear convergence in informative basins, and show how Lie-algebraic variance proxies enhance test power without compromising statistical calibration.

*Josef Soucek,Michael Petrov,Michal Gulka,Emilie Bourgeois,Milos Nesladek*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A mathematical model for photoelectric response in NV diamond centers, validated experimentally, optimizes qubit readout by including charge dynamics and defect effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a precise model for photocurrent readout in NV centers, including the effects of charge carrier drift, collection, and other defects, for applications in sensing and quantum information science.

Method: The model uses a multilevel system (including mS=0, mS=+-1 ground and excited states, singlet state, and NV0 neutral state) and incorporates charge state transitions and recombination dynamics via the Boltzmann transport equation. It also accounts for substitutional nitrogen (NS) and acceptor defects.

Result: The model successfully calculates ODMR and PDMR responses, quantum efficiencies, and identifies an optimal parameter space for qubit operations with high spin contrast, particularly influenced by NS presence.

Conclusion: The mathematical model for the photoelectric response of NV centers in diamond, including drift and collection of charge carriers and the effects of other defects, was experimentally confirmed and provides a valuable tool for optimizing NV qubit photoelectric readout performance.

Abstract: We report on a mathematical model of the photoelectric response of NV colour centres in diamond, that can be employed for sensing and quantum science information applications. Although the model applies to NV centre in diamond, it can be applied with small modifications to other semiconducting solid state qubits. In our model, we include the drift and collection of charge carriers as well as the presence of other defects via generation and recombination dynamics. Though the photoluminescence readout and the associated dynamics of the NV defect has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically, so far, there has been no precise model for photocurrent readout, including these effects. In our description, we use a multilevel-level system including mS=0, mS=+-1 ground and excited states, singlet state and the NV0 neutral state. Also, the presence of substitutional nitrogen (NS), which for example determines the spin coherence via the paramagnetic spin bath, is discussed together with presence of acceptor defects. We model the time-dependent occupation of all electronic sublevels and also consider the electronic charge transport from the Boltzmann transport equation, leading to information about the charge state transitions and recombination dynamics. ODMR and PDMR response as well as their quantum efficiencies, are calculated. On this basis, we determine an optimal parameter space for qubit operations, including the highest spin contrast and especially relate those to NS presence. The model is confirmed experimentally and can become a useful tool for optimisation of the performance of NV qubit photoelectric readout.

Motivation: Investigate the failure of monogamy of mutual information (MMI) in graph states as a forbidden-subgraph phenomenon.

Method: Constructing a family of star-like graphs and deriving adjacency matrix constraints for MMI evaluation; analyzing general star topologies and performing an exhaustive search over graph representatives.

Result: Proved the forbidden-subgraph conjecture for a specific family of graphs and identified that MMI violation is not limited to these cases.

Conclusion: MMI failure is not reducible to the cases within our scope, as established by an exhaustive search over 8-qubit stabilizer entropy vectors.

Abstract: The monogamy of mutual information (MMI) is a quantum entropy inequality that enforces the non-positivity of tripartite information. We investigate the failure of MMI in graph states as a forbidden-subgraph phenomenon, conjecturing that every MMI-violating graph state is local-Clifford equivalent to one whose graph contains a four-star subgraph. We construct a family of star-like graphs whose states fail a specific class of MMI instances, and extend this analysis to general star topologies. Deriving adjacency matrix constraints that fix the MMI evaluation for these instances and interpreting them physically, we prove the forbidden-subgraph conjecture for this family of graphs. Finally, through an exhaustive search over graph representatives for all $8$-qubit stabilizer entropy vectors, we establish that MMI failure is not reducible to the cases within our scope.

Conclusion: 成功在光量子计算机上模拟了贝里相位，并扩展到非绝热演化，证明了对称性设计可以消除非几何误差，突出了几何相位的内在鲁棒性。

Abstract: We formulate a continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC) algorithm to study Berry's phase on photonic quantum computers. We demonstrate that CVQC allows the simulation of charged particles with orbital angular momentum under the influence of an adiabatically changing $\vec{B}$ field. Although formulated entirely in the CVQC setting, our construction uses only passive linear-optical operations (beam splitters and phase shifts), which act identically in single-photon photonic architectures. This enables experimental realisation on the Quandella Ascella platform, where we observe the Berry's phase phenomenon with interferometric measurement. We also generalise the framework to more rapid non-adiabatic evolution. By concatenating Aharonov-Anandan cycles for opposing magnetic fields we demonstrate that one can engineer a circuit in which dynamical phases and leading non-geometric errors cancel by symmetry, leaving the intrinsically robust geometric phase contribution.

*Ruihua Fan,Yantao Wu,Yimu Bao,Zhehao Dai*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Sequential unitary circuits cannot prepare 2D chiral states due to no-go theorems for Gaussian fermion and generic interacting systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations of sequential unitary circuits in preparing two-dimensional chiral states and to explore the relationship between such states, tensor networks, and quantum channel dynamics.

Method: The study uses a correspondence between sequentially prepared states, isometric tensor network states, and one-dimensional quantum channel circuits. For Gaussian fermion systems, the method involves linking entanglement spectrum features to algebraic decay correlations. For generic systems, the analysis focuses on causality constraints.

Result: Two no-go theorems: Gaussian fermion systems cannot support algebraically decaying correlations or chiral states, and generic interacting systems cannot host tripartite entanglement of chiral states due to causality.

Conclusion: The paper establishes two no-go theorems for preparing two-dimensional chiral states using sequential unitary circuits. One theorem applies to Gaussian fermion systems, showing they cannot support algebraically decaying correlations or represent chiral states. The other applies to generic interacting systems, demonstrating the impossibility of hosting tripartite entanglement of chiral states due to causality constraints.

Abstract: We investigate whether sequential unitary circuits can prepare two-dimensional chiral states, using a correspondence between sequentially prepared states, isometric tensor network states, and one-dimensional quantum channel circuits. We establish two no-go theorems, one for Gaussian fermion systems and one for generic interacting systems. In Gaussian fermion systems, the correspondence relates the defining features of chiral wave functions in their entanglement spectrum to the algebraic decaying correlations in the steady state of channel dynamics. We establish the no-go theorem by proving that local channel dynamics with translational invariance cannot support such correlations. As a direct implication, two-dimensional Gaussian fermion isometric tensor network states cannot support algebraically decaying correlations in all directions or represent a chiral state. In generic interacting systems, we establish a no-go theorem by showing that the state prepared by sequential circuits cannot host the tripartite entanglement of a chiral state due to the constraints from causality.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A novel approach for auxiliary variable selection in QAOA reduces circuit depth by 40% by considering qubit connectivity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional auxiliary variable selection methods for QAOA ignore qubit connectivity constraints, leading to incompatible interaction graphs and high compilation overhead.

Method: A novel method for selecting auxiliary variables is introduced, focusing on constructing interaction graphs with a regular structure and limited maximal degree of vertices to match quantum device constraints.

Result: The new method significantly improves QAOA circuit mapping efficiency, reducing circuit depth by nearly 40%.

Conclusion: The proposed approach reduces QAOA circuit depth by almost 40% compared to conventional methods, making it more efficient for quantum architectures with limited connectivity.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) requires considered optimization problems to be translated into a compatible format. A popular transformation step in this pipeline involves the quadratization of higher-order binary optimization problems, translating them into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations through the introduction of auxiliary variables. Conventional algorithms for the selection of auxiliary variables often aim to minimize the total number of required variables without taking the constraints of the underlying quantum computer-in particular, the connectivity of its qubits-into consideration. This quickly results in interaction graphs that are incompatible with the target device, resulting in a substantial compilation overhead even with highly optimized compilers. To address this issue, this work presents a novel approach for the selection of auxiliary variables tailored for architectures with limited connectivity. By specifically constructing an interaction graph with a regular structure and a limited maximal degree of vertices, we find a way to construct QAOA circuits that can be mapped efficiently to a variety of architectures. We show that, compared to circuits constructed from a QUBO formulation using conventional auxiliary selection methods, the proposed approach reduces the circuit depth by almost 40%. An implementation of all proposed methods is publicly available at https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/problemsolver.

TL;DR: Squeezed reservoirs drive entropy flow and reveal exceptional points in open quantum systems, showing PT symmetry depends on quadrature phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how squeezed reservoirs can engineer nonclassical noise and control irreversible dynamics in open quantum systems, focusing on entropy flow and exceptional points.

Method: The analysis is conducted within the Gaussian formalism, deriving closed-form evolution equations for the covariance matrix. The study explores the impact of squeezing on entropy generation and the structure of exceptional points in the Lindblad dynamics.

Result: Squeezing induces entropy generation at second order in anomalous correlations, distinct from thermal environments. A characteristic 'exceptional-point fan' is identified, separating PT-unbroken and PT-broken regions, with PT symmetry surviving only for opposite quadrature squeezing.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that squeezed reservoirs offer a unique platform for studying coherence-driven entropy flow and the geometric organization of exceptional points (EPs) in open quantum systems. It highlights the nonlinear mechanism of entropy generation in squeezed environments and the critical role of quadrature phases in preserving PT symmetry.

Abstract: Squeezed reservoirs provide a powerful means of engineering nonclassical noise and controlling irreversible dynamics in open quantum systems. Here we develop a comprehensive analysis of two coupled harmonic oscillators driven by independent squeezed baths, focusing on the emergence of coherence-driven entropy flow and the structure of exceptional points (EPs) in the corresponding Lindblad dynamics. Working entirely within the Gaussian formalism, we derive closed-form evolution equations for the covariance matrix and show that squeezing induces entropy generation only at *second order* in the anomalous correlations, a nonlinear mechanism absent in thermal environments. This entropy flow is accompanied by a rich non-Hermitian structure: by scanning the squeezing parameters we uncover a characteristic "exceptional-point fan" in the (M1, M2) plane, which separates a narrow PT-unbroken region of oscillatory dynamics from broad PT-broken sectors in which one normal mode becomes purely overdamped. This geometric organization of EPs reveals that PT symmetry survives only when the two reservoirs squeeze opposite quadratures, and is generically broken for in-phase squeezing. Our analysis establishes squeezed reservoirs as a natural setting where information-bearing noise drives irreversible behavior through coherent pathways, and lays the groundwork for experimentally accessible probes of entropy flow and critical mode behavior in more complex open systems.

Conclusion: 外部单位控制被确定为精密计量学的通用资源，并为量子传感的未来实现铺平了道路。

Abstract: Quantum thermometry aims at determining temperature with ultimate precision in the quantum regime. Standard equilibrium approaches, limited by the Quantum Fisher Information given by static energy fluctuations, lose sensitivity outside a fixed temperature window. Non-equilibrium strategies have therefore been recently proposed to overcome these limits, but their advantages are typically model-dependent or tailored for a specific purpose. This Letter establishes a general, model-independent result showing that any temperature-dependent unitary driving applied to a thermalized probe enhances its quantum Fisher information with respect to its equilibrium value. Such information gain is expressed analytically through a positive semi-definite kernel of information currents that quantify the flow of statistical distinguishability. Our results are benchmarked on a driven spin-$1/2$ thermometer, furthermore showing that resonant modulations remarkably restore the quadratic-in-time scaling of the Fisher information and allow to shift the sensitivity peak across arbitrary temperature ranges. Our findings identify external unitary control as a universal resource for precision metrology and pave the way for future implementations in quantum sensing.

TL;DR: Quantum trajectories defy conventional wisdom by staying spread over transient eigenstates late into dynamics, correlating with steady-state purity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamics of open quantum systems by examining the localization of quantum trajectories in the Liouvillian eigenbasis and to challenge the conventional understanding of late-time dynamics.

Method: The approach involves analyzing individual quantum trajectories in the eigenbasis of the Liouvillian superoperator, constructing a quasiprobability distribution from trajectory-eigenstate overlaps, and validating the findings through numerical simulations of interacting spin chains and bosonic systems.

Result: Trajectories can remain significantly spread over transient eigenstates even at late times, and this delocalization correlates with the purity of the trajectory-averaged steady state.

Conclusion: The study reveals that quantum trajectories can remain spread over transient eigenstates deep within the Liouvillian spectrum, challenging the common belief that late-time dynamics are governed solely by the steady state and slowest-decaying modes. This delocalization correlates with the purity of the trajectory-averaged steady state, linking trajectory and ensemble descriptions of open quantum dynamics.

Abstract: We develop an approach for understanding the dynamics of open quantum systems by analyzing individual quantum trajectories in the eigenbasis of the Liouvillian superoperator. From trajectory-eigenstate overlaps, we construct a quasiprobability distribution that characterizes the degree of localization of the trajectories in the Liouvillian eigenbasis. Contrary to the common wisdom that late-time dynamics are governed solely by the steady state and the slowest-decaying modes, we show that trajectories can remain well spread over transient eigenstates deep within the bulk of the Liouvillian spectrum even at late times. We demonstrate this explicitly using numerical simulations of interacting spin chains and bosonic systems. Moreover, we find that the delocalization of the trajectory strongly correlates with the purity of the trajectory-averaged steady state, establishing a further link between the trajectory and ensemble pictures of open quantum dynamics.

Motivation: To address the instability of real-coefficient splitting methods at high orders and enable stable simulation of dynamics with unitary and dissipative components.

Method: A high-order splitting method using complex-coefficient splitting with positive real parts to simulate non-unitary dynamics via sequential real- and imaginary-time Hamiltonian evolutions.

Result: The method achieves stable integration in quantum circuits, with an example of simulating the damped-wave equation at sixth-order accuracy requiring 1,562 CNOT gates for a single step in three dimensions on 35 trillion cells.

Conclusion: The presented high-order splitting method is stable and efficient, demonstrated by simulating the damped-wave equation with sixth-order accuracy within the coherence limits of modern quantum processors.

Abstract: We present a high-order splitting method for simulating non-unitary dynamics by sequential real- and imaginary-time Hamiltonian evolutions. Complex-coefficient splitting methods with positive real parts are chosen for stable integration in a quantum circuit, avoiding the unstable, norm-amplifying negative steps that arise from real-coefficient splitting at high orders. The method is most beneficial for dynamics that naturally separate into unitary and dissipative components, with broad applications across science and engineering. These systems frequently admit compact spectral representations of the split operators, which we demonstrate by deriving efficient quantum circuits for simulating the damped-wave equation with up to sixth-order accuracy in time. A single sixth-order step in three dimensions on 35 trillion cells requires 1,562 CNOT gates, which can be executed within the coherence time of modern quantum processors.

Motivation: To understand the microscopic origins of the ensemble spectrum in Er³⁺:TiO₂ epitaxial thin films and address limitations caused by local disorder and interfacial noise.

Method: Ab initio calculations combined with noise-Hamiltonian modeling and Monte Carlo simulations, along with photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy.

Result: Er³⁺ ions at increasing distances from the interface show a systematic blue shift in the Y₁→Z₁ transition due to strain relaxation, with thermal annealing revealing the roles of oxygen-vacancy and gallium-diffusion noise.

Conclusion: The study provides microscopic insights into disorder-driven decoherence in Er³⁺:TiO₂ thin films, offering pathways for controlling hybrid quantum systems for scalable quantum technologies.

Abstract: Harnessing rare-earth ions in oxides for quantum networks requires integration with bright emitters in III-V semiconductors, but local disorder and interfacial noise limit their optical coherence. Here, we investigate the microscopic origins of the ensemble spectrum in Er$^{3+}$:TiO$_2$ epitaxial thin films on GaAs and GaSb substrates. Ab initio calculations combined with noise-Hamiltonian modeling and Monte Carlo simulations quantify the effects of interfacial and bulk spin noise and local strain on erbium crystal-field energies and inhomogeneous linewidths. Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy reveals that Er$^{3+}$ ions positioned at increasing distances from the III-V/oxide interface produce a systematic blue shift of the $Y_1\rightarrow Z_1$ transition, consistent with strain relaxation predicted by theory. Thermal annealing produces a compensating redshift and linewidth narrowing, isolating the roles of oxygen-vacancy and gallium-diffusion noise. These results provide microscopic insight into disorder-driven decoherence, offering pathways for precise control of hybrid quantum systems for scalable quantum technologies.

Motivation: Performing absorption spectroscopy on individual molecules is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio.

Method: A nondestructive absorption spectroscopy technique is used to detect the absorption of a single photon via momentum transfer onto a single molecular ion co-trapped with an atomic ion. The recoil signal is amplified using a non-classical state of motion of the two-ion crystal and read out via the atomic ion.

Conclusion: This method represents a milestone towards quantum non-demolition measurements of complex polyatomic molecules, providing high-fidelity methods for preparation and measurement of the quantum state of a wide range of molecular species.

Abstract: Absorption spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for probing molecular structure. However, performing absorption spectroscopy on individual molecules is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we report on a nondestructive absorption spectroscopy on a mid-infrared vibrational transition in a single molecular ion that is co-trapped with an atomic ion. The absorption of a single photon is detected via the momentum transfer from the absorbed photon onto the molecule. This recoil signal is amplified using a non-classical state of motion of the two-ion crystal and subsequently read out via the atomic ion. We characterize the recoil detection method and use it to investigate the interaction between femtosecond laser pulses and the O-H stretching vibration in individual CaOH+ molecular ions. Furthermore, we present the single-photon absorption spectrum obtained for the vibrational transition. This method represents a milestone towards quantum non-demolition measurements of complex polyatomic molecules, providing high-fidelity methods for preparation and measurement of the quantum state of a wide range of molecular species.

Abstract: We estimate the run-time and energy consumption of simulating non-equilibrium dynamics on neutral atom quantum computers in analog mode, directly comparing their performance to state-of-the-art classical methods, namely Matrix Product States and Neural Quantum States. By collecting both experimental data from a quantum processing unit (QPU) in analog mode and numerical benchmarks, we enable accurate predictions of run-time and energy consumption for large-scale simulations on both QPUs and classical systems through fitting of theoretical scaling laws. Our analysis shows that neutral atom devices are already operating in a competitive regime, achieving comparable or superior performance to classical approaches while consuming significantly less energy.

Motivation: To investigate how detuning and auxiliary qubits collaboratively enhance quantum synchronization in a dissipative multi-qubit system coupled to a structured reservoir.

Method: Analysis using the Husimi Q-function, synchronization measures, and Arnold tongue structures.

Result: Detuning emerges as a powerful control parameter in the non-Markovian regime, enhancing phase locking. Adding more auxiliary qubits amplifies this effect, resulting in robust phase locking.

Conclusion: These results establish a cooperative control strategy where detuning actively engineers phases, while auxiliary qubits provide the necessary memory for sustained synchronization.

Abstract: We investigate how detuning and auxiliary qubits collaboratively enhance quantum synchronization in a dissipative multi-qubit system that is coupled to a structured reservoir. Our findings indicate that while detuning is ineffective in Markovian environments, it emerges as a powerful control parameter in the non-Markovian regime, where environmental memory facilitates long-lived phase coherence. It is shown that adding more auxiliary qubits amplifies this effect by strengthening the collective coupling and enhancing memory, resulting in robust phase locking within the system. Analysis using the Husimi Q-function, synchronization measures, and Arnold tongue structures reveals a detuning-induced enhancement of phase locking, which significantly improves stability compared to the resonance case. These results establish a cooperative control strategy where detuning actively engineers phases, while auxiliary qubits provide the necessary memory for sustained synchronization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend classical denoising ideas into the quantum domain by interpreting shrinkage as a quantum process and combining statistical adaptivity with quantum unitarity.

Method: Phase damping and ancilla-driven constructions are used to realize quantum wavelet shrinkage as a completely positive trace-preserving process. Practical implementations are demonstrated using Qiskit with examples provided in Jupyter notebooks.

Result: A unified framework for quantum wavelet shrinkage is developed, showing how quantum decoherence mechanisms can be repurposed for noise suppression in quantum circuits.

Conclusion: The work provides a conceptual and experimental link between wavelet-based statistical inference and quantum information processing, and shows how engineered decoherence can act as an operational surrogate for classical shrinkage.

Abstract: This paper develops a unified framework for quantum wavelet shrinkage, extending classical denoising ideas into the quantum domain. Shrinkage is interpreted as a completely positive trace-preserving process, so attenuation of coefficients is carried out through controlled decoherence rather than nonlinear thresholding. Phase damping and ancilla-driven constructions realize this behavior coherently and show that statistical adaptivity and quantum unitarity can be combined within a single circuit model. The same physical mechanisms that reduce quantum coherence, such as dephasing and amplitude damping, are repurposed as programmable resources for noise suppression. Practical demonstrations implemented with Qiskit illustrate how circuits and channels emulate coefficientwise attenuation, and all examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks in the companion GitHub repository. Encoding schemes for amplitude, phase, and hybrid representations are examined in relation to transform coherence and measurement feasibility, and realizations suited to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices are discussed. The work provides a conceptual and experimental link between wavelet-based statistical inference and quantum information processing, and shows how engineered decoherence can act as an operational surrogate for classical shrinkage.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: PARITY is optimal for non-adaptive NLB distillation with trivial local marginals but not for n=2 with non-trivial margins (OR performs better). Adaptive protocols with identical NLBs are equivalent to PARITY with nonidentical NLBs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimality of the PARITY protocol for non-adaptive distillation of nonlocal boxes (NLBs) based on XOR games and to explore the impact of local marginals on protocol performance.

Method: The study proves the optimality of the PARITY protocol for a general class of non-adaptive distillation protocols and analyzes its limitations when local marginals are non-trivial, particularly for the case of n=2.

Result: The PARITY protocol is optimal for a general class of non-adaptive distillation protocols with trivial local marginals. For n=2 and non-trivial local marginals, the OR protocol outperforms PARITY. Additionally, an equivalence between adaptive protocols with identical NLBs and PARITY with nonidentical NLBs is established.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates an equivalence between adaptive distillation protocols using identical nonlocal boxes (NLBs) and the PARITY protocol with nonidentical NLBs, highlighting the importance of understanding local properties for characterizing global behavior.

Abstract: We prove that the PARITY protocol is optimal for a general class of non-adaptive distillation protocols of all $n$ player nonlocal boxes (NLBs) based on XOR games. The conditional distributions generated by these NLBs are assumed to have trivial local marginals. We also show that already for $n=2$, PARITY is no longer optimal if the local marginals are non-trivial. The OR protocol is shown to perform better and in the process also slightly extend the known correlations that collapse communication complexity. This emphasizes again the need to understand the local properties of nonlocal systems in order to obtain a better characterization of the global behavior. We conclude by showing an equivalence between adaptive distillation protocols that use identical NLBs and PARITY protocol using nonidentical NLBs.

TL;DR: A new fault-tolerance method reduces resource overhead in quantum computing by eliminating T-gate compilation needs, achieving efficient small-angle rotations with minimal error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the prohibitively large spacetime overhead in fault-tolerant quantum computing, especially for Clifford + $\varphi$ compiling tasks.

Method: Combining perturbative analysis of dissipative noise with stabilizer code properties to design 1-fault-tolerant continuous-angle rotation gates via dispersive-coupling Hamiltonians.

Result: The method suppresses gate error to $91|\varphi| p^2$ for small angles, enabling reliable execution of over $10^7$ small-angle rotations at $p=10^{-3}$ and reducing spacetime costs by factors of 1337.5 and 43.6 compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed error-structure-tailored fault tolerance framework enables hardware-efficient quantum computing by circumventing the need for T-gate compilation and distillation, reducing spacetime resource costs significantly.

Abstract: Fault tolerance is widely regarded as indispensable for achieving scalable and reliable quantum computing. However, the spacetime overhead required for fault-tolerant quantum computating remains prohibitively large. A critical challenge arises in many quantum algorithms with Clifford + $\varphi$ compiling, where logical rotation gates $R_{Z_L}(\varphi)$ serve as essential components. The Eastin-Knill theorem prevents their transversal implementation in quantum error correction codes and necessitating resource-intensive workarounds through T-gate compilation combined with magic state distillation and injection. In this work, we consider error-structure-tailored fault tolerance, where fault-tolerance conditions are analyzed by combining perturbative analysis of realistic dissipative noise processes with the structural properties of stabilizer codes. Based on this framework, we design 1-fault-tolerant continuous-angle rotation gates in stabilizer codes, implemented via dispersive-coupling Hamiltonians. Our approach could circumvent the need for T-gate compilation and distillation, offering a hardware-efficient solution that maintains simplicity, minimizes physical footprint, and requires only nearest-neighbor interactions. Integrating with recent small-angle-state preparation techniques, we can suppress the gate error to $91|\varphi| p^2$ for small rotation angle (where p denotes the physical error rate). For current achievable hardware parameters ($p=10^{-3}$), this enables reliable execution of over $10^7$ small-angle rotations when $|\varphi|\approx 10^{-3}$, meeting the requirements of many near-term quantum applications. Compared to the 15-to-1 magic state distillation and magic state cultivation approaches, our method reduces spacetime resource costs by factors of 1337.5 and 43.6, respectively, for a Heisenberg Hamiltonian simulation task under realistic hardware assumptions.

TL;DR: Relaxing symmetry requirements in virtual phase-covariant quantum broadcasting improves performance but remains sample-inefficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether relaxing the symmetry requirements can improve the operational performance of virtual quantum broadcasting for observable estimation tasks.

Method: Relaxing symmetry requirements to focus on virtual phase-covariant quantum broadcasting for qubits, imposing phase-covariance, flip covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency to determine the map's structure.

Result: Identified the unique map minimizing simulation cost, proving both simulation cost and distance to the closest CPTP map are smaller than in the unitary covariant setting. The closest physical map is the optimal phase-covariant cloning channel.

Conclusion: The resulting virtual broadcasting map, despite improvements, remains sample-inefficient and operationally impractical.

Abstract: Virtual maps allow the simulation of quantum operations by combining physical processes with classical post-processing. Recent work on virtual unitary covariant broadcasting has shown, however, that such maps remain impractical for observable estimation tasks due to poor sample efficiency. Here we investigate whether relaxing the symmetry requirements can improve operational performance, focusing on virtual phase-covariant quantum broadcasting for qubits. We show that imposing phase-covariance, flip covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency fully determines the structure of the broadcasting map. Within this family, we identify the unique map that minimizes the simulation cost, and we prove that both the simulation cost and the distance to the closest CPTP map are strictly smaller than in the unitary covariant setting. We also demonstrate that the closest physical map is the optimal phase-covariant cloning channel, mirroring the relation between unitary covariant broadcasting and universal cloning. Despite these improvements, the resulting virtual broadcasting map remains sample-inefficient and is therefore still operationally impractical.

Method: Introduction of Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry (k-DQI) integrating spectral engineering into the quantum circuit architecture, using unitary kernels to reshape the energy landscape.

Result: Demonstrated significant boosts in effective signal-to-noise ratio with negligible depth overhead in Optimal Polynomial Interpolation (OPI) and LDPC-like problems.

Conclusion: These results reframe DQI from a static algorithm into a tunable, noise-aware protocol suited for near-term error-corrected environments.

Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) promises superpolynomial speedups for structured optimization; however, its practical realization is often hindered by significant sensitivity to hardware noise and spectral dispersion. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry (k-DQI)}, a unified framework that integrates spectral engineering directly into the quantum circuit architecture. By inserting a unitary kernel prior to the interference step, k-DQI actively reshapes the problem's energy landscape, concentrating the solution mass into a ``decoder-friendly'' low-frequency head. We formalize this advantage through a novel robustness metric, the noise-weighted head mass $Σ_K$, and prove a \textbf{Monotonic Improvement Theorem}, which establishes that maximizing $Σ_K$ guarantees higher decoding success rates under local depolarizing noise. We substantiate these theoretical gains in Optimal Polynomial Interpolation (OPI) and LDPC-like problems, demonstrating that kernel tuning functions as a ``spectral lens'' to recover signal otherwise lost to isotropic noise. Crucially, we provide explicit, efficient circuit realizations using Chirp and Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) kernels that achieve significant boosts in effective signal-to-noise ratio with negligible depth overhead ($\tilde{O}(n)$ to $\tilde{O}(n^2)$). Collectively, these results reframe DQI from a static algorithm into a tunable, noise-aware protocol suited for near-term error-corrected environments.

Motivation: The motivation behind the research is to address the crucial problem of quantum state reconstruction (solution readout) in quantum computing, despite the existence of numerous efficient quantum algorithms. The goal is to improve the efficiency and practicality of reconstructing continuous real-valued functions for practical problems like computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

QAE-based methods are more suitable for mid-term/far-term quantum devices. Benchmark tests in CFD show significant improvements over conventional sampling methods for large grid numbers. The methods also enable efficient solutions to the 2D Burgers' equation without linearization.

Conclusion: The proposed efficient readout methods demonstrate potential quantum advantages for practical applications, especially in solving PDEs like the 2D Burgers' equation. They highlight the feasibility of using mid-term quantum devices without relying on expensive linearization strategies.

Abstract: Quantum computing is a promising technology that accelerates the partial differential equations solver for practical problems. The reconstruction of solutions (i.e., the readout of quantum states) remains a crucial problem, although numerous efficient quantum algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we propose and compare several efficient readout methods in the real and the Fourier space. The Fourier space readout (FSR) and the proposed approximate real space readout (ARSR) methods are currently the most efficient and practical ones for the purpose of reconstructing continuous real-valued functions. In contrast, the quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) based methods (especially in the Fourier space) are favorable for mid-term/far-term quantum devices. Besides, we apply the methods for benchmark solutions in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and demonstrate great improvements compared to the conventional sampling method for large grid numbers. Equipped with efficient readout methods, we further show that a 2D Burgers' equation can be solved efficiently without using the expensive strategy of linearization. It suggests the potential quantum advantages for some practical applications on mid-term quantum devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast coherent state transport is crucial for quantum computation, but adiabatic methods are slow. A faster, adaptable protocol is needed for efficient quantum operations.

Method: Utilizes a bang-bang-bang (BBB) protocol with forward and backward-moving trap potentials, and applies squeezed coherent state evolution under varying potential depths.

Result: The BBB protocol approaches the quantum speed limit, performs better than forward-moving-only protocols, and achieves shorter timescales with squeezed coherent states.

Conclusion: The BBB protocol outperforms conventional forward-moving-only methods, advancing quantum control capabilities.

Abstract: Fast coherent state transport is essential to quantum computation and quantum information processing. While an adiabatic transport of atomic qubits guarantees a high fidelity of the state preparation, it requires a long timescale that defies efficient quantum operations. Here, we propose an adaptable and fast bang-bang-bang (BBB) protocol, utilizing a combination of forwardand backward-moving trap potentials, to expedite the coherent state transport. This protocol approaches the quantum speed limit under a harmonic trap potential, surpassing the performance by the forward-moving-only potential protocols. We further showcase the advantage of applying squeezed coherent state evolution under a deeper potential followed by a weaker one, where a design of symmetric squeezing potential transports promotes an even shorter timescale for genuine state preparation. Our protocols outperform conventional forward-moving-only methods, providing new insights and opportunities for rapid state transport and preparation, ultimately advancing the capabilities of quantum control and quantum operations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of amplifying weak quantum signals in quantum computing with minimal noise, aiming for quantum-limited performance.

Method: The paper discusses the principles of superconducting parametric amplification, including nonlinear mixing processes and resonator design (lumped-element and distributed-element). A meandered quarter-wavelength CPW resonator design is simulated.

Result: SPAs can achieve or approach the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) by leveraging nonlinearities in superconducting materials and optimized resonator designs.

Conclusion: The chapter underscores the importance of resonator design in optimizing SPA performance, with a practical example demonstrating the impact of geometric parameters on resonant frequency and coupling strength.

Abstract: Superconducting parametric amplifiers (SPAs) are critical components for ultralow-noise qubit readout in quantum computing, addressing the critical challenge of amplifying weak quantum signals without introducing noise that degrades coherence and computational fidelity. Unlike classical amplifiers, SPAs can achieve or closely approach quantum-limited performance, specifically the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of half a photon of added noise for phase-preserving amplification. The core principle of SPAs relies on parametric amplification, where energy is transferred from a strong pump tone to a weak input signal through non-dissipative nonlinear mixing processes. This is enabled by intrinsic nonlinearities in superconducting materials, primarily kinetic inductance in thin films (e.g., NbTiN, Al) and, more significantly, the Josephson effect in Josephson junctions. These nonlinear elements facilitate frequency mixing (three-wave or four-wave mixing) and can operate in phase-preserving or phase-sensitive amplification modes, with the latter allowing for noise squeezing below the SQL. This chapter emphasizes the significant role of resonator design in determining critical SPA performance metrics such as gain, bandwidth, and noise characteristics. It details both lumped-element (LC) and distributed-element (coplanar waveguide, CPW) resonators, discussing their unique properties, suitability for different frequency ranges, and the importance of achieving high-quality factors (Q) for efficient energy storage and minimal loss. A practical design and simulation of a meandered quarterwavelength CPW resonator coupled to a feed line is presented, illustrating how precise control over geometric parameters optimizes resonant frequency, coupling strength, and quality factor for high-fidelity qubit state discrimination.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The configuration space, i.e. the Hilbert space, of compound quantum systems grows exponentially with the number of its subsystems: its dimensionality is given by the product of the dimensions of its constituents. Therefore a full quantum treatment is rarely possible analytically and can be carried out numerically for fairly small systems only. Fortunately, in order to obtain interesting physics, approximations often very well suffice. One of these approximations is given by the cumulants expansion, where expectation values of products of operators are approximated by products of expectation values of said operators, neglecting higher-order correlations. The lowest order of this approximation is widely known as the mean field approximation and used routinely throughout quantum physics. Despite its ubiquitous presence, a general criterion for applicability and convergence properties of higher order cumulants expansions remains to be found. In this paper, we discuss two problems in quantum electrodynamics and quantum information, namely the collective radiative dissipation of a dipole-dipole interacting chain of atoms and the factorization of a bi-prime by annealing in an adiabatic quantum simulator. In the first case we find smooth, convergence behavior, where the approximation performs increasingly better with higher orders, while in the latter going beyond mean field turns out useless and, even for small system sizes, we are puzzled by numerically challenging and partly non-physical solutions.

Result: The RNG demonstrates precise control over transition probabilities and times, meeting standard randomness tests.

Conclusion: The proposed Brillouin optomechanical system successfully passes standard NIST SP 800-22 tests, paving the way for an all-optical integrated True RNG with equal probability bit generation.

Abstract: We propose a model of binary random number generator (RNG) based on a Brillouin optomechanical system. The device uses a hard excitation mode in a Brillouin optomechanical system, where thermal noise induces spontaneous transitions between two stable states in the hard excitation mode. We demonstrate the existence of an amplitude criterion for observing these transitions and show that the probability distribution of their occurrence in the non-generating and generating states can be precisely controlled by the amplitude of an external pump wave. At the same time, the use of a low-intensity seed wave allows for the control of the transition times between states. We demonstrate that the proposed random number generator successfully passes the standard tests NIST SP 800-22. The obtained result opens a way for development of an all-optical integrated True RNG, generating a sequence of random bits with equal probability.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate the practicality, stability, and scalability of the three-time-bin TF-QKD protocol for real-world quantum communication networks.

Abstract: We present the experimental implementation of a three-time-bin phase-encoded Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF-QKD) protocol using a Sagnac-based star-topology plug-and-play architecture. The proposed encoding method leverages the relative phases of three consecutive time bins to encode two bits per signal. The Sagnac loop configuration enables self-compensation for both phase and polarisation drifts, eliminating the need for active stabilisation. However, field deployments are subject to rapid phase fluctuations caused by external vibrations, which can degrade interference visibility. We used the first time bin for real-time phase-fluctuation monitoring. Although this monitoring reduces the effective key generation rate, the system achieved a secure key rate of approximately 1.5e-5 bits per pulse, with a corresponding visibility of up to 87% over a 50 km asymmetric optical fibre channel. These results demonstrate the practicality, stability, and scalability of the proposed three-time-bin TF-QKD protocol for real-world quantum communication networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the unclear expected performance and classical simulability of fixed-round QAOA for general combinatorial optimization problems, focusing on Max-Cut and extending to BUCO.

Method: The method involves showing NP-hardness results for evaluating QAOA expectations and developing a dynamic programming algorithm based on tree decomposition. The framework is extended to general BUCO, and evaluations are conducted on structured graph families.

Result: Results include NP-hardness proofs for QAOA evaluation, a polynomial-time exact evaluation algorithm under certain conditions, and empirical evaluations on structured graphs showing competitive performance against classical baselines.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that for general graphs and any fixed round p≥2, evaluating the expectation of fixed-round QAOA is NP-hard and proposes a dynamic programming algorithm for exact evaluation when p-local treewidth grows logarithmically. It also extends the framework to general BUCO and provides reproducible evaluations on specific structured families.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is widely studied for combinatorial optimization and has achieved significant advances both in theoretical guarantees and practical performance, yet for general combinatorial optimization problems the expected performance and classical simulability of fixed-round QAOA remain unclear. Focusing on Max-Cut, we first show that for general graphs and any fixed round $p\ge2$, exactly evaluating the expectation of fixed-round QAOA at prescribed angles is $\mathrm{NP}$-hard, and that approximating this expectation within additive error $2^{-O(n)}$ in the number $n$ of vertices is already $\mathrm{NP}$-hard. To evaluate the expected performance of QAOA, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm leveraging tree decomposition. As a byproduct, when the $p$-local treewidth grows at most logarithmically with the number of vertices, this yields a polynomial-time \emph{exact} evaluation algorithm in the graph size $n$. Beyond Max-Cut, we extend the framework to general Binary Unconstrained Combinatorial Optimization (BUCO). Finally, we provide reproducible evaluations for rounds up to $p=3$ on representative structured families, including the generalized Petersen graph $GP(15,2)$, double-layer triangular 2-lifts, and the truncated icosahedron graph $C_{60}$, and report cut ratios while benchmarking against locality-matched classical baselines.

Motivation: To explore quantum measurement retrodiction using the principle of minimum change, and to derive unique divergence-independent updates and tighter entropic uncertainty relations.

Method: The study uses the principle of minimum change and quantum divergences to analyze quantum measurement retrodiction. It constructs a symmetric joint distribution for POVM pairs and derives mutual retrodictability and entropic uncertainty relations.

Result: The research shows that all standard quantum divergences select the same retrodictive update. It introduces mutual retrodictability and derives two tight entropic uncertainty relations, validated numerically across various measurements and states.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the retrodictive framework, based on the principle of minimum change, yields a unique and divergence-independent quantum Bayesian inverse for any POVM and prior state. It also introduces mutual retrodictability and derives entropic uncertainty relations that are tighter than existing ones.

Abstract: We study quantum measurement retrodiction using the principle of minimum change. For quantum-to-classical measurement channels, we show that all standard quantum divergences select the same retrodictive update, yielding a unique and divergence-independent quantum Bayesian inverse for any POVM and prior state. Using this update, we construct a symmetric joint distribution for pairs of POVMs and introduce the mutual retrodictability, for which we also derive a general upper bound that depends only on the prior state and holds for all measurements. This structure leads to two retrodictive entropic uncertainty relations, expressed directly in terms of the prior state and the POVMs, but valid independently of the retrodictive framework and fully compatible with the conventional operational interpretation of entropic uncertainty relations. Finally, we benchmark these relations numerically and find that they provide consistently tighter bounds than existing entropic uncertainty relations over broad classes of measurements and states.

Motivation: Non-Markovian noise, a challenging form of quantum computing noise, is difficult to characterize and suppress.

Method: Implementation of a quantum purification-inspired protocol using nuclear spins, theoretically proven to exponentially reduce non-Markovian error rates.

Result: Experimental demonstration shows successful suppression of non-Markovian noise for both unitary operations and non-unitary channels.

Conclusion: The scheme's practicality and effectiveness are confirmed through observed fidelities and process tomography closely matching theoretical predictions.

Abstract: Non-Markovian noise, arising from environmental memory effects, is the most general and challenging form of noise in quantum computing, and is typically difficult to characterize and suppress. Here, we analyze and experimentally demonstrate a non-Markovian noise suppression scheme inspired by quantum purification protocols. We theoretically prove that, even without noise calibration and assumptions on specific noise models, the scheme can exponentially reduce non-Markovian error rates with respect to the ancillary system size. We implement the protocol using nuclear spins, demonstrating that non-Markovian noise can be suppressed for both unitary operations and non-unitary channels. The observed fidelities and process tomography show close agreement with theoretical predictions, confirming the practicality and effectiveness of the scheme.

Abstract: The Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error correcting code uses a bosonic mode to encode a logical qubit, and has the attractive property that its logical Clifford gates can be implemented using Gaussian unitary gates. In contrast, a direct unitary implementation of the ${T}$ gate using the cubic phase gate has been shown to have logical error floor unless the GKP codestate has a biased noise profile [1]. In this work, we propose a method for on-demand noise biasing based on a standard GKP error correction circuit. This on-demand biasing circuit can be used to bias the GKP codestate before a $T$ gate and return it to a non-biased state afterwards. With the on-demand biasing circuit, we prove that the logical error rate of the $T$ gate can be made arbitrarily small as the quality of the GKP codestates increases. We complement our proof with a numerical investigation of the cubic phase gate subject to a phenomenological noise model, showing that the ${T}$ gate can achieve average gate fidelities above $99\%$ with 12 dB of GKP squeezing without the use of postselection. Moreover, we develop a formalism for finding optimal unitary representations of logical diagonal gates in higher levels of the Clifford hierarchy that is based on a framework of ``polynomial phase stabilizers'' whose exponents are polynomial functions of one of the quadrature operators. This formalism naturally extends to multi-qubit logical gates and even to number-phase bosonic codes, providing a powerful algebraic tool for analyzing non-Clifford gates in bosonic quantum codes.

Abstract: We investigate photon tunneling in a pair of coupled inverted circular split-ring microwave resonators with four discrete chiral orientations. By varying the spacing between the resonators, we observe strong modulation of the transmission spectra, including mode splitting, interference effects, and the formation of dark states. Measurements on fabricated devices show clear signatures of hybridization that depend on both chirality and proximity, and these results are consistent with full-wave electromagnetic simulations. To describe the observed behavior, we develop a circuit quantum electrodynamics model that captures the dependence of the coupling strength on geometry and the reversal of its sign. Although the experimental excitation is classical, the system reproduces features expected from two quantized harmonic oscillators, providing a classical analogue of a chiral quantum hybrid platform. The ability to control photon tunneling through structural design and excitation parameters suggests potential applications in reconfigurable photonic devices, quantum communication, chiral sensing, and polarization-selective signal processing.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effect of the Lorentz transformation on the measures of quantum coherence in an entangled atomic system. Here, we consider the effect of this relativistic boosts on two-particle entangled generalized Gaussian wave packets in two scenarios. In the first scenario, we consider that the relativistic boost affects the one particle and other remains unaffected while in the second scenario, we consider that both the particles are affected by the effect of the relativistic boost. The coherence of the wave function as measured by the boosted observer is studied as a function of the boost parameter and the width of the Gaussian wave packets. Using various formulations of coherence, it is shown that in general the coherence decays with increase in the width of the Gaussian wave packet, higher values of boost parameter, and the number of particles on which boost is applied.

Abstract: In quasi-Hermitian quantum mechanics (QHQM) of unitary systems, an optimal, calculation-friendly form of Hamiltonian is generally non-Hermitian, $H \neq H^\dagger$. This makes its physical interpretation ambiguous. Without altering $H$, this ambiguity is resolved by specifying a nontrivial inner-product metric $Θ$ in Hilbert space. Here, we focus on an alternative strategy: transforming $H$ into a Hermitian form via the Dyson map $Ω: H \to \mathfrak{h}$. This construction of the Hermitian isospectral twin $\mathfrak{h}$ of $H$ does not only restore the conventional correspondence principle between quantum and classical physics, but it also provides a framework for the exhaustive classification of all admissible probabilistic interpretations of quantum systems in QHQM framework.

TL;DR: Improved routing algorithms for quantum networks with non-isotonic utility functions, using best-first-search and metaheuristics to balance path quality and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing routing algorithms for quantum networks assume isotonic utility functions, but realistic utility functions (e.g., those considering entanglement rate and quality) are non-isotonic, making classical algorithms like Dijkstra's unsuitable.

Method: Two best-first-search algorithms (one provably optimal and one heuristic) and metaheuristic algorithms (simulated annealing and a genetic algorithm) are proposed.

Result: Improved algorithms achieve faster convergence, sublinear scaling in query count, and enable tuning the tradeoff between path quality and computational overhead.

Conclusion: The paper introduces improved algorithms for optimal routing in quantum-repeater networks, addressing the challenge of non-isotonic utility functions and providing practical solutions with varying tradeoffs between path quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Optimal routing in quantum-repeater networks requires finding the best path that connects a pair of end nodes. Most previous work on routing in quantum networks assumes utility functions that are isotonic, meaning that the ordering of two paths does not change when extending both with the same edge. However, we show that utility functions that take into account both the rate and quality of the entanglement generation (e.g., the secret-key rate) are often non-isotonic. This makes pathfinding difficult as classical algorithms such as Dijkstra's become unsuitable, with the state of the art for quantum networks being an exhaustive search over all possible paths. In this work we present improved algorithms. First, we present two best-first-search algorithms that use destination-aware merit functions for faster convergence. One of these provably finds the best path, while the other uses heuristics to achieve an effectively sublinear scaling of the query count in the network size while in practice always finding a close-to-optimal path. Second, we present metaheuristic algorithms (simulated annealing and a genetic algorithm) that enable tuning a tradeoff between path quality and computational overhead. While we focus on swap-ASAP quantum repeaters for concreteness, our algorithms are readily generalized to different repeater schemes and models.

Motivation: To investigate the role of current, rather than magnetic field, as the external drive in Type-II superconductors and understand the nucleation of vortices under current-biased cooling.

Method: Imaging the magnetic field of a high-T_c cuprate superconductor strip after cooling, focusing on current-biased cooling and small external magnetic fields.

Result: Current-biased cooling nucleates vortices within the strip even in zero magnetic field, and with a small external field, the vortex distribution polarizes opposite to the Lorentz-force direction.

Conclusion: Current history in superconductors is encoded as vortices, revealing self-field effects that influence direct current measurements and glassy transitions under drive.

Abstract: Type-II superconductors exhibit hysteretic behavior due to the presence of quantum vortices, and the order in which temperature and external field are varied plays a decisive role. Here we take current, rather than magnetic field, as the external drive. We image the magnetic field of a high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor strip after cooling. We confirm that even in zero magnetic field, current-biased cooling nucleates vortices within the strip. With a small external magnetic field, the distribution is polarized opposite to the Lorentz-force direction. These behaviors follow from the self-consistent relation between current and local field in steady flux flow. Our findings show that current history is encoded as vortices. This reveals self-field effects that influence dc measurements and glassy transitions under drive.

Motivation: Understanding the microscopic origin and formation pathway of stripe order in the superconducting phase of anisotropic superconductors.

Method: Analyzing controlled interfacial disorder in MgO/KTaO3(111) heterostructures to observe the evolution from localized Cooper-pair islands to superconducting puddles and stripes.

Result: Disorder drives a percolative evolution, with the stripe width matching the spin precession length, indicating self-organized modulation governed by spin-orbit coupling and lattice-symmetry breaking.

Conclusion: The findings highlight disorder as both a tuning parameter and a diagnostic probe for emergent superconductivity in two-dimensional quantum materials.

Abstract: The sensitivity of low dimensional superconductors to fluctuations gives rise to emergent behaviors beyond the conventional Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer framework. Anisotropy is one such manifestation, often linked to spatially modulated electronic states and unconventional pairing mechanisms. Pronounced in plane anisotropy recently reported at KTaO3 based oxide interfaces points to the emergence of a stripe order in superconducting phase, yet its microscopic origin and formation pathway remain unresolved. Here, we show that controlled interfacial disorder in MgO/KTaO3(111) heterostructures drives a percolative evolution from localized Cooper-pair islands to superconducting puddles and eventually to stripes. The extracted stripe width matches the spin precession length, suggesting a self organized modulation governed by spin orbit coupling and lattice-symmetry breaking. These findings identify disorder as both a tuning parameter and a diagnostic probe for emergent superconductivity in two dimensional quantum materials.

Result: Achieved a critical current density of 76 uA/um2 with 4 nm ALD TaN, demonstrating stable performance and potential for large-scale superconducting circuits.

Conclusion: This work presents a scalable, CMOS-compatible process for fabricating thermally and environmentally stable Josephson junctions, paving the way for a Superconducting Quantum Process Design Kit and Quantum Foundry.

Abstract: Josephson junctions form the core circuit element in superconducting quantum computing circuits, single flux quantum digital logic circuits, and sensing devices such as SQUIDs. Aluminum oxide has typically been used as the tunnel barrier. Its formation by exposure to low oxygen pressures at room temperature for short periods of time makes it susceptible to aging and limits the thermal budget of downstream processes. In this paper, we report the first demonstration of α-Ta/insulating TaN/a-Ta superconductor/insulator/superconductor Josephson junctions fabricated on 300 mm wafers using CMOS-compatible processes. The junctions were fabricated on high-resistivity silicon substrates using standard processes available at 300 mm scale, including 193 nm optical lithography, ALD of TaN in a cluster tool, and chemical mechanical planarization to enable highly planar interfaces. Junction areas ranging from 0.03 um2 to 9 um2 with ALD TaN thickness between 2 nm and 7 nm were characterized. A critical current density of 76 uA/um2 was observed in junctions using 4 nm ALD TaN in the tunnel barrier. The dependence of Jc on ALD TaN layer thickness is analyzed, and the influence of junction geometry, packaging, and temperature on I-V characteristics is discussed. Junctions were retested after a period of 4 months to quantify junction aging. The potential of this novel material system and a 300 mm superconducting junction process flow to fabricate thermally and environmentally stable junctions is discussed. The vision of a Superconducting Quantum Process Design Kit for a Multi-Project Wafer program to enable rapid development and proliferation of superconducting quantum and digital digital logic systems is presented. This work represents the first step towards establishing such a Quantum Foundry, providing access to high quality qubits and single-flux quantum logic circuits at 300 mm wafer scale.

Motivation: The motivation is to showcase the unique advantages of planar Josephson junctions over traditional overlap junctions, particularly in applications requiring high sensitivity and miniaturization.

Method: The paper highlights the geometric distinction between overlap and planar Josephson junctions and explores the advantages of planar junctions, such as enhanced magnetic field sensitivity and improved impedance matching.

Result: Recent advances include the use of planar junctions in junction-on-cantilever sensors, vortex-based memory cells, and programmable superconducting diodes, demonstrating their versatility and potential.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by discussing the general requirements, future perspectives, and key challenges in the field of superconducting electronics, emphasizing the potential of planar junctions in novel technologies.

Abstract: Josephson junctions are key elements in superconducting electronics. The most common type is the overlap (sandwich-type) junction, formed by vertically stacking two superconducting layers. In contrast, planar junctions are fabricated without overlap, at the edge of two superconducting films within a single plane. This geometric distinction has a significant impact on their physical properties. The planar geometry greatly enhances sensitivity to magnetic fields and improves impedance matching for terahertz (THz) devices. Its two-dimensional structure allows for simple and flexible electronic component design, enabling drastic miniaturization. Here I highlight recent advances in the application of planar junctions for novel technologies, including junction-on-cantilever sensors for super-resolution magnetic imaging, vortex-based memory cells, and programmable superconducting diodes. I will also discuss the general requirements, future perspectives, and key challenges in the evolving field of superconducting electronics.

TL;DR: The paper unifies flux-radius laws, transport costs, and angle balances in branched networks under a single dimensionless index chi, showing their interdependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile previously separate theories (Murray-type, Gilbert-type, Young-Herring) into a cohesive framework for branched networks.

Method: The study employs a quadratic, scale-free ledger framework to unify theories, deriving a two-term form for the ledger and analyzing local optimality conditions.

Result: A unified structure controlled by chi is revealed, connecting flux-radius power laws, Young-Herring vector balance, and Gilbert-type transport costs, with chi serving as an order parameter.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that flux-radius laws, transport costs, and triple-junction angle balances are unified under a single dimensionless index chi, with implications for understanding scale-free branching architectures.

Abstract: Murray-type flux-radius laws, Gilbert-type concave transport costs, and Young-Herring triple-junction angle balances are usually treated as separate theories. This work shows that, within a natural class of quadratic, scale-free ledgers for branched networks, all three are different faces of a single structure controlled by one dimensionless index chi. Each edge carries a flux Q, an effective radius r, and a per-length ledger P(Q,r) encoding transport dissipation and structural burden. Under locality, evenness in Q, linear-response (quadratic) dependence, and an exact homogeneity ansatz in (Q,r), any admissible ledger reduces in the scale-free regime to the two-term form P(Q,r) = a Q^2 r^{-p} + b r^m. Local optimality then implies simultaneously: (i) a flux-radius power law with generalized Murray closures at degree-3 nodes; (ii) a Young-Herring-type vector balance with radius weights r^m and a fixed symmetric Y-junction angle; and (iii) an effective flux-only cost of Gilbert/branched-transport type with exponent beta. The exponents alpha and beta, the symmetric angle, and the split between transport and structural cost are all set by chi = m/(m+p) = beta/2. A rigidity theorem shows conversely that any quadratic ledger that yields power-law optimal radii and power-law flux-only cost on an open scaling cone must belong to this two-term family and obey the same Murray-Gilbert-Young dictionary. Examples for Poiseuille, diffusive, and geophysical trees illustrate how chi can be inferred from geometry and used as a falsifiable order parameter for scale-free branching architectures.

TL;DR: The paper explains the absence of a spin glass transition in 2D via symmetry analysis, contrasting with higher dimensions where spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why no finite temperature transition to a spin glass phase is observed in two dimensions and how it differs from higher dimensions.

Method: The paper leverages renormalization group fixed points and symmetry analysis.

Result: In two dimensions, a continuous internal symmetry prevents the spin glass transition, while in higher dimensions, the symmetry can be broken spontaneously, leading to a continuous spin glass order parameter.

Conclusion: The study explains the absence of a finite temperature spin glass transition in two dimensions due to the enhancement of a one-generator continuous internal symmetry.

Abstract: We recently showed that the two-dimensional Ising spin glass allows for a line of renormalization group fixed points. We observe that this exact result corresponds to enhancement to a one-generator continuous internal symmetry. This finally explains why no finite temperature transition to a spin glass phase is observed in two dimensions. In more than two dimensions, instead, the continuous symmetry can be broken spontaneously and yields a spin glass order parameter which, for fixed temperature and disorder strength, takes continuous values in an interval. Such a feature is shared by the order parameter of the known mean field solution of the model with infinite-range interactions, which corresponds to infinitely many dimensions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation arises from understanding the behavior of the FQHE at filling 5/2 as it transitions into a nematic phase, and exploring the potential role of a pair density wave (PDW) as a precursor state.

Method: The analysis is based on a microscopic description of the pairing phase in the weak-coupling regime, considering the transformation of the FQHE state into a nematic phase under pressure.

Result: The results suggest that the relevant PDW state has a strong-pairing character, and the p-wave paired state may generally be prone to PDW instability.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the PDW state in the FQHE at filling 5/2 exhibits strong-pairing character, and the p-wave paired state may generally be prone to PDW instability due to a single collective mode associated with the order parameter.

Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at filling 5/2, which is usually understood as a $p$-wave paired state of underlying quasiparticles - composite fermions, transforms into a nematic phase under pressure \cite{csathy0, csathy}. A pair density wave (PDW) may be a precursor, underlying state for this behaviour, and such state(s) were proposed that maintain the weak-pairing feature of the uniform paired state \cite{frad}. Based on considerations in the weak-coupling regime of a microscopic description of the pairing phase (to mimic the phase as it gives way to a nematic phase in the experiments), we argue that the ensuing and relevant PDW state has a strong-pairing character. Furthermore, due to the existence of a single collective mode associated with the order parameter in the uniform paired phase, in the weak-coupling regime, the $p$-wave paired state, in general (for example, in the superconducting state of electrons), may be prone to a PDW instability.

Motivation: To address the lack of systematic constructions for nonabelian topological orders, which are central to quantum computing but often rely on case-by-case conceptually involved methods.

Method: Formulating a topological $S[O(2)\times O(2)]$ BF theory, identifying Wilson loops and twist operators with anyons, and constructing a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter.

Result: The topological BF theory reproduces complete anyon data and incorporates Dijkgraaf--Witten twists, and a microscopic model yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase with a direct transition to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase.

Conclusion: The proposal offers a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases, providing an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising applications in synthetic gauge field platforms.

Abstract: Nonabelian topological orders host exotic anyons central to quantum computing, yet established realizations rely on case-by-case constructions that are often conceptually involved. In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further indicates a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.

Motivation: To demonstrate the effectiveness of RBMs in capturing the intricate correlations and constraints of disordered and frustrated magnetic phases.

Method: The study employs Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to model spin configurations in frustrated magnets, benchmarking with the ANNNI model and applying to kagome spin ice systems.

Result: RBMs successfully learned the ground-state manifold of the ANNNI model and the ice rules of kagome spin ice, matching Monte Carlo simulation results. They also accurately modeled the symmetry-breaking in the ice-II phase.

Conclusion: RBMs are versatile generative models capable of accurately learning and reproducing complex magnetic states, including frustrated and disordered phases, with high fidelity.

Abstract: We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a flexible generative framework for modeling spin configurations in disordered yet strongly correlated phases of frustrated magnets. As a benchmark, we first demonstrate that an RBM can learn the zero-temperature ground-state manifold of the one-dimensional ANNNI model at its multiphase point, accurately reproducing its characteristic oscillatory and exponentially decaying correlations. We then apply RBMs to kagome spin ice and show that they successfully learn the local ice rules and short-range correlations of the extensively degenerate ice-I manifold. Correlation functions computed from RBM-generated configurations closely match those from direct Monte Carlo simulations. For the partially ordered ice-II phase -- featuring long-range charge order and broken time-reversal symmetry -- accurate modeling requires RBMs with uniform-sign bias fields, mirroring the underlying symmetry breaking. These results highlight the utility of RBMs as generative models for learning constrained and highly frustrated magnetic states.

Abstract: We study the finite-temperature stability of skyrmion crystals in frustrated magnets by analyzing the momentum-space exchange interaction of a classical Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice. Our analysis identifies two key momentum-space features that play a crucial role in stabilizing the skyrmion crystal phase. The first is the sixfold anisotropy in the momentum-space exchange interaction, which acts as a locking potential favoring triple-$Q$ skyrmion crystals. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that a larger anisotropy tends to enhance the stability region of the skyrmion crystal in the temperature--magnetic-field phase diagram. The second factor is the momentum-space energy related to the uniform spin mode, which correlates with the emergence of the skyrmion crystal phase at finite temperatures. These results provide a further understanding of the stabilization mechanism of the skyrmion crystal phase in frustrated magnets and will be useful for the design of skyrmion-hosting materials.

Motivation: The motivation was to explore whether the gapless phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model, which differs significantly from the gapped phase, could also be disentangled using Clifford circuits. The goal was to enhance computational efficiency and reduce resource requirements for simulations and quantum state preparation.

Method: The authors employed the Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) method to investigate the Kitaev honeycomb model. They focused on the gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase and compared the efficiency of CAMPS with conventional MPS methods.

Result: Approximately two-thirds of the entanglement entropy in the isotropic point of the Kitaev QSL phase arises from Clifford-circuit contributions. CAMPS simulations revealed significant disentanglement, enabling more efficient computations compared to conventional MPS methods. The method was applied to the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, yielding accurate phase boundaries.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that the CAMPS method can significantly disentangle the gapless phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model, revealing that a large portion of the entanglement entropy arises from Clifford-circuit contributions. This enhances classical simulation efficiency and suggests resource reduction for quantum state preparation. The method was successfully applied to the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, providing accurate phase boundaries.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Kitaev honeycomb model employing the recently developed Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) method. While the model in the gapped phase is known to reduce to the toric code model - whose ground state is entirely constructible from Clifford circuits - we demonstrate that the very different gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase can also be significantly disentangled with Clifford circuits. Specifically, CAMPS simulations reveal that approximately two-thirds of the entanglement entropy in the isotropic point arises from Clifford-circuit contributions, enabling dramatically more efficient computations compared to conventional matrix product state (MPS) methods. Crucially, this finding implies that the Kitaev QSL state retains significant Clifford-simulatable structure, even in the gapless phase with non-abelian anyon excitations when time reversal symmetry is broken. This property not only enhances classical simulation efficiency significantly but also suggests substantial resource reduction for preparing such states on quantum devices. As an application, we leverage CAMPS to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model and determine the most accurate phase boundary between the anti-ferromagnetic phase and the Kitaev QSL phase in the model. Our results highlight how Clifford circuits can effectively disentangle the intricate entanglement of Kitaev QSLs, opening avenues for efficiently simulating related and similar strongly correlated models.
