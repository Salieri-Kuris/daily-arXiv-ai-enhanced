Abstract: In recent years, the increasing level of control over van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures has opened new routes to tune the properties of quantum materials. Motivated by these developments, we examine the potential consequences of interfacing a Kitaev honeycomb magnet, such as $α$-RuCl$_3$, with a nearly lattice-matched vdW antiferromagnet. By combining perturbation theory, exact diagonalization, and a classical energy-minimization method, we show that an effective staggered magnetic field originating from the vdW antiferromagnet can drive a monolayer of a Kitaev material into various novel phases, including an antichiral Kitaev spin liquid, a nonmagnetic nematic phase, and different types of skyrmion crystals. We then apply first-principle simulations to assess the prospect of concretely realizing this setup in a heterobilayer of $α$-RuCl$_3$ and the easy-axis antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$.

Abstract: Electron interactions can drive magnetism, superconductivity, and topology. However, the realization of these phases remains limited in van der Waals materials, and the full landscape of strong correlations remains uncharted in any context. While interactions between conduction electrons and localized spins yield a well-known competition between heavy fermions (Kondo hybridization) and magnetic order (RKKY exchange), such spin-driven competition represents only part of the correlated electron phase diagram. Here we demonstrate that a heavy-fermion state can also compete with charge order, such as the charge density wave (CDW) state typical in the van der Waals $4f$ rare-earth tritellurides (RTe$_3$). We exploit the spatially-extended $5f$ orbitals of $β$-UTe$_3$ to enhance Kondo hybridization compared to its isostructural RTe$_3$ cousins. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy on $β$-UTe$_3$ shows Fano resonances characteristic of the heavy fermion state, while our quasiparticle interference imaging reveals the disappearance of Fermi-level nesting and the appearance of flat bands. We extend the tritelluride tight-binding model to include Kondo coupling and quantify the Fermi surface reconstruction. Consistent with the destruction of nesting, we observe no CDW in $β$-UTe$_3$. Our expansion of the Kondo phase diagram beyond spin-mediated competition opens new possibilities for proximity-induced phase engineering in correlated van der Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: Quantum geometry quantifies how the single-particle Bloch wavefunction changes in phase and amplitude across the Brillouin Zone. In multi-orbital systems where bands have strongly mixed orbital composition, quantum geometry plays a vital role in determining the ground state and low-energy properties of interacting electronic systems. In this work, we show that Mott metal-insulator transitions, as well as transitions between different magnetic orders within the Mott insulating phase, can be driven by the quantum geometry of the underlying Bloch band, thereby providing a mechanism complementary to conventional bandwidth-tuned Mott transitions. By studying the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that in in half-filled and topologically-trivial bands, quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states alone can act as a tuning knob for Mott metal-to-insulator and affect the competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. We show that both transitions may be heuristically understood via non-local Coulomb scattering in a basis of exponentially localized Wannier functions. These results highlight the role of quantum geometry beyond topological settings as a governing principle for conventional Mott and magnetic physics in multi-orbital and moiré materials.

Abstract: We study when a density-matching Kohn--Sham (KS) description can reproduce a many-body Berry phase in a correlated insulator, despite the fact that geometric phases are functionals of the wave function. Focusing on the one-dimensional SSH--Hubbard chain on a ring as a controlled interacting topological model, we introduce a $U(1)$ twist $θ$ (flux insertion). The many-body ground state along the full twist cycle is computed by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), while the onsite interaction $U$ is tuned from the noninteracting to the strong-coupling regime. At half filling in the inversion-symmetric gapped regime, our DMRG calculations show that the density remains constant within numerical accuracy over the entire $(θ,U)$ range studied. Thus, the density has no dependence on either the flux $θ$ or the interaction strength $U$. Accordingly, the symmetry-preserving density constraint collapses the KS reference to an SSH-type quadratic representative with $U$-independent geometric diagnostics. Nevertheless, the many-body wave function exhibits a nontrivial geometric response: the quantum metric associated with the $θ$-parametrized ground-state manifold depends on $θ$ at intermediate $U$ and is strongly suppressed at large $U$, consistent with the charge fluctuation freezing. Intriguingly, the KS and many-body Berry phases coincide throughout the gapped regime as $U$ is tuned from weak to strong coupling. We show that this agreement is best understood as symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector matching, rather than as evidence that the density encodes the many-body Berry connection.

Abstract: This work presents a formulation to express and optimize stochastic neural networks as quantum circuits in gate-based quantum computing. Motivated by a classical perceptron, stochastic neurons are introduced and combined into a quantum neural network. The Kiefer-Wolfowitz algorithm in combination with simulated annealing is used for training the network weights. Several topologies and models are presented, including shallow fully connected networks, Hopfield Networks, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Autoencoders and convolutional neural networks. We also demonstrate the combination of our optimized neural networks as an oracle for the Grover algorithm to realize a quantum generative AI model.

Abstract: Quantum state transfer is the primitive of transporting an unknown state on one site of a lattice to another. Using power-law interactions, recent state transfer protocols achieve speedup by utilizing the intermediate ancilla sites. However, these protocols require the ancillas to be in a perfectly initialized state, which, due to noise or imperfect control, may not be the case. In this work we introduce the $\textit{robustness}$ of a state transfer protocol, which quantifies the protocol's tolerance to error in the initial ancilla state. In the Heisenberg picture, state transfer grows operators supported on the final site such that they no longer commute with all operators on the starting site. We prove that this robustness tightly bounds the Schatten $p$-norms of these commutators between initial and final-site operators. This generalizes the known cases of $p=\infty$ and $p=2$, which govern completely state-dependent and state-independent state transfer respectively, demonstrating that intermediate values of $p$ govern partially state-dependent state transfer. In conjunction with existing power-law light cones, our result gives new minimum runtimes for partially state-dependent protocols which, in certain regimes, are parametrically better than existing bounds. We introduce new robust state transfer protocols, charting the landscape between complete state-dependence and state-independence.

Abstract: The study of fermionic quantum field theories is an important problem for realizing the standard model of particle physics on a quantum computer. As a step towards this goal, we consider the massive Thirring and Gross--Neveu models with arbitrary number of fermion flavors, $N_f$, discretized on a spatial one-dimensional lattice of size $L$ in the Hamiltonian formulation. We compute the gate complexity using the higher-order product formula and using block-encoding/qubitization and quantum singular value transformations in the limit of large $N_f$ and $L$. We also prepare the ground states of both models with excellent fidelity for system sizes up to 20 qubits with $N_f = 1,2,3,4$ using the adaptive-variational quantum imaginary time algorithm. In addition, we also classify the dynamical Lie algebras of these relativistic fermionic models and show that they belong to the same isomorphism class. Our work is a concrete step towards the quantum simulation of real-time dynamics of large $N_f$ fermionic quantum field theories models relevant for chiral symmetry breaking, understanding dimensional transmutation, and exploring the conformal window of field theories on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Abstract: We introduce a family of many-body systems of distinguishable continuous-variable particles in which interparticle interactions are set by the adjacency matrix of a graph. The ground-state wavefunction of such systems is of a generalized Jastrow form involving the product of pair-correlation functions over the edge set of the graph. These systems describe quantum fluids when the graph is complete, and the pair function has a well-defined permutation symmetry. In general, they provide the continuous-variable generalization of spin systems on graphs, with broken permutation symmetry. The corresponding parent Hamiltonian is shown to include (a) two-body interactions determined by the graph adjacency matrix and (b) three-body interactions over all possible 2-paths on the graph. Employing elements of graph theory, we chart the landscape of models, recovering known instances in the literature and providing numerous new examples of ground-state solvable models for which the system Hamiltonian, ground-state wavefunction, and corresponding energy eigenvalue are specified.

Abstract: Adiabatic (or reversible) processes are the key concept unifying our understanding of thermodynamics and dynamical systems. Reversibility in the thermodynamic sense is understood as entropy-preserving processes, such as in the idealized Carnot engine, whereas in integrable dynamical systems it is understood as the conservation of the action variables. Between these two idealized limits, however, where the phase space can become mixed, things are much less clear. In this work, we first determine the extent to which reversible processes are even possible in this regime. We then explore how the dissipative losses resulting from rapidly driving these kinds of systems can be fought by approximate counterdiabatic driving. Finally, we argue that much of the phenomenology should be the same for quantum many-body systems with large degeneracy in the presence of integrability breaking perturbations.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables information-theoretic secure communication, yet its ultimate tolerance to noise and achievable transmission distance remain fundamentally constrained. We establish the maximum quantum bit error rate (QBER) compatible with secure QKD and derive corresponding upper bounds on communication distance. Our results follow from a fundamental capacity threshold for qubit Pauli channels and apply to protocols based on two or more mutually unbiased bases, using either single-photon or weak coherent sources. By connecting information-theoretic limits to realistic physical noise models, we obtain universal bounds on achievable distances in fiber and free-space links, including diffraction-limited constraints relevant to deep-space quantum communications. These findings clarify the ultimate noise robustness of QKD and delineate the fundamental boundaries of secure quantum communication.

Abstract: We establish a symmetry-protected correspondence between band topology of coherent Hamiltonians and Liouvillian spectral winding in Lindblad descriptions of open quantum systems. This allows the Hamiltonian topology to act as a knob for controlling Liouvillian topology and corresponding non-equilibrium dynamics, rather than being passively manipulated by system-environment exchanges. In particular, by exactly solving the Liouvillian spectrum in a class of one-dimensional dissipative lattices, we find that the Hamiltonian band topology constrains the Liouvillian spectral winding and determines the Liouvillian skin effect, provided the Hamiltonian and quantum jump operators respect the same chiral symmetry. We further demonstrate that lattice parity controls the associated bulk-boundary correspondence and the coherence properties of the steady state. Our results unveil a symmetry-enforced topological control of spectral and spatial organization in open quantum systems, providing a unified perspective on topology in Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics.

Abstract: Identifying the boundary between classical and quantum computation is a central challenge in quantum information. In multi-qubit systems, entanglement and magic are the key resources underlying genuinely quantum behaviour. While entanglement is well understood, magic -- essential for universal quantum computation -- remains relatively poorly characterised. Here we show that determining membership in the stabilizer polytope, which defines the free states of magic-state resource theory, requires super-exponential time $\exp( n^2)$ in the number of qubits $n$, even approximately. We reduce the problem to solving a $3$-SAT instance on $n^2$ variables and, by invoking the exponential time hypothesis, the result follows. As a consequence, both quantifying and certifying magic are fundamentally intractable: any magic monotone for general states must be super-exponentially hard to compute, and deciding whether an operator is a valid magic witness is equally difficult. As a corollary, we establish the robustness of magic as computationally optimal among monotones. This barrier extends even to classically simulable regimes: deciding whether a state lies in the convex hull of states generated by a logarithmic number of non-Clifford gates is also super-exponentially hard. Together, these results reveal intrinsic computational limits on assessing classical simulability, distilling pathological magic states, and ultimately probing and exploiting magic as a quantum resource.

Abstract: Macroscopic quantum electrodynamics (MQED) provides a unified framework to describe quantum electromagnetic fields in the presence of arbitrary macroscopic environments. Central to this theory is the field correlation, which governs both radiative (e.g., Lamb shifts and the Purcell effect) and mechanical phenomena, such as van der Waals and Casimir forces. In this tutorial, we provide an overview of MQED and its extension to active media, highlighting fluctuation-induced forces as manifestations of gain-modified field correlations.

Abstract: Building a useful quantum computer is a grand science and engineering challenge, currently pursued intensely by teams around the world. In the 1980s, Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin observed independently that computers based on quantum mechanics might enable better simulations of quantum phenomena. Their vision remained an intellectual curiosity until Peter Shor published his famous quantum algorithm for integer factoring, and shortly thereafter a proof that errors in quantum computations can be corrected. Since then, quantum computing R&D has progressed rapidly, from small-scale experiments in university physics laboratories to well-funded industrial efforts and prototypes. Hype notwithstanding, quantum computers have yet to solve scientifically or practically important problems -- a target often called quantum utility. In this article, we describe the capabilities of contemporary quantum computers, compare them to the requirements of quantum utility, and illustrate how to track progress from today to utility. We highlight key science and engineering challenges on the road to quantum utility, touching on relevant aspects of our own research.

Abstract: We study the minimum cut problem in weighted undirected graphs using variational quantum algorithms in which only feasible cut configurations are explored. Although minimum cut admits efficient classical solutions, it is a fundamental component of more complex network optimization problems such as multicut and network interdiction. Our objective is to examine quantum models in which feasibility is preserved by the mixer dynamics, without introducing penalty terms in the cost Hamiltonian. We employ a ring structured XY mixer that restricts the quantum evolution to the subspace of valid cut configurations, ensuring that all sampled states correspond to feasible solutions. To address scalability limitations, we suggest an iterative metaheuristic strategy that decomposes large instances into smaller subproblems solved sequentially using the same quantum model. The results obtained using the mixer indicate that the initial probability distribution can be systematically controlled, thereby enabling the development of warm start techniques within variational quantum based algorithms.

Abstract: The spin nematic phase, characterized by long-range order of spin quadrupole moments in the absence of dipolar magnetism, presents a significant challenge for conventional experimental detection. We propose a novel method to detect this elusive order in quantum magnets with an illustration in the spin-1 triangular lattice Mott insulator. By integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom, we obtain a phase diagram with substantially enlarged regions for the spin-nematic and spin-nematic-supersolid phases. We then demonstrate that through the spin-lattice coupling, the emergence of spin nematic order imprints a distinctive signature onto the phonon spectra, providing a clear spectroscopic signature for the quadrupolar order accessible via Raman or inelastic X-ray scattering. Our formalism offers a direct and powerful method to uncover the hidden spin nematicity, opening a new pathway for diagnosing multipolar orders in quantum magnets.

Abstract: Individual spin defects in solids are promising building blocks for quantum technologies, but their deterministic creation, individual addressability, and operation near surfaces remain major challenges. Two-dimensional materials provide an attractive alternative, as their single-layer thickness enables direct atomic-scale access to defect states. Here, we demonstrate single-spin control of solid-state defects in a two-dimensional semiconductor by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance. We create and manipulate individual sulfur vacancies and carbon substitution defects in monolayer molybdenum disulfide and characterize their spin dynamics, including coherent control, at the single-defect level. Using atomic manipulation, we further engineer and probe spin-spin interactions between defect pairs. Our results demonstrate deterministic creation, addressability, coherent manipulation, and controlled coupling of individual spin defects within a single experimental platform. This establishes atomically engineered spin defects in two-dimensional semiconductors as a versatile class of controllable solid-state quantum systems and opens a route towards tailored quantum sensing experiments.

Abstract: Two anyons encircling each other acquire a quantized braiding phase that is independent of their spatial separation. We show that detecting this phase in a fractional quantum Hall interference experiment results in a quantum Zeno effect: a localized anyon is trapped by constant observation from a stream of anyons supplied by the measurement current. Interferometers with an embedded antidot are ideal for accessing the Zeno regime, where the bare tunneling rate of localized anyons is much lower than the measurement rate. The Zeno-suppressed tunneling rate of the trapped anyon depends on the braiding phase and the transmission of the quantum point contacts. Our primary prediction is that the autocorrelation time of the conductance through the interferometer increases with the bias current. This effect may be used to experimentally control the anyon dynamics, in particular to increase the lifetime of localized anyons.

Abstract: We demonstrate the presence of quantum interference effects in van der Waals heterostructures subject to in-plane electric fields. The in-plane field $F$ accelerates carriers through a hybridized band edge, and interlayer Zener tunneling occurs by distinct pathways, resulting in a solid-state quantum interferometer with imprints in transport observables. For parabolic-band bilayers, we identify two characteristic signatures which are observable in lateral conductance: Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg oscillations in the band-overlap regime periodic in $1/F$ at small fields, resembling electric-field induced quantum oscillations, and a pronounced resonance at $F\propto T_0^{3/2}$ set by the interlayer tunneling $T_0$. These features provide a directly accessible probe of coherent interferometric dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures, and could be harnessed for more precise engineering and characterization.

Abstract: Entropy governs molecular self-assembly, phase transitions, and material stability, yet remains challenging to quantify and directly control in molecular systems. Here, we demonstrate that the computable information density (CID), a data compression-based information theoretic metric, provides an instantaneous general measure of configurational entropy in molecular dynamics simulations, reflecting both local and long-range structural organization. We validate the CID across systems of increasing complexity, beginning with single-component Lennard-Jones melting before examining binary phase separation, polymer condensation and dispersion, and assembly of amorphous carbon networks at multiple densities. Unlike conventional order parameters, CID requires no a priori knowledge of relevant structural features and captures entropic signatures across a variety of molecular systems and discretization resolutions. By establishing entropy as a directly accessible structural metric, this framework lays a foundation for future entropy-driven materials design and optimization strategies.

Abstract: We investigate thermalization in a tight-binding chain with an on-site defect subject to local dephasing noise implemented as random phase kicks. For a single linear defect of strength $ε$, we obtain an exact analytical description of the system spectrum and formulate the dephasing-induced dynamics in the eigenstate basis. We derive an approximate kinetic equation for mode populations that describes a continuous-time random walk in action space. The walk transition rates are defined by the overlap matrix encoding the spatial structure of eigenstates that can be computed exactly. Analyzing the spectral properties of the equation, we show that defect-induced localized modes act as bottlenecks that strongly slow down relaxation, with rates scaling as $ε^{-2}$ for strong defects. Using large-deviation theory, we characterize rare dynamical trajectories and identify distinct relaxation pathways associated with low- and high-activity regimes in action space. We provide numerical evidence that the large-deviation function exhibits a dynamical phase transition in the limit $ε\to \infty$. We then extend our analysis to the nonlinear case, considering a single nonlinear defect embedded in either a linear or a fully nonlinear discrete Schrödinger equation. Numerical simulations reveal a qualitatively faster approach to equilibrium driven by the amplitude-dependent weakening of the defect. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding thermalization, rare fluctuations, and relaxation pathways in stochastic tight-binding systems.

Abstract: We derive a thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) under quantum continuous measurement and feedback control. By incorporating the quantum-classical-transfer entropy, which quantifies the information gained by continuous measurement, we show that the precision of currents is constrained by information-thermodynamic costs such as the entropy production and information gain. Our result shows that information gain has the potential to enhance the precision of currents beyond the bounds set by the conventional TUR. We illustrate the bound with a driven two-level system under continuous measurement and feedback, demonstrating that feedback achieves higher precision of currents while suppressing the entropy production.

Here we focus on the $q$-TASEP in either continuous or discrete time. Each particle on $\mathbb{Z}$ jumps independently by $+1$ with a rate (or probability) depending on the gap to the next particle on its right. We consider initial conditions (either step or random) which are empty of particles on $\mathbb{Z}^+$, and focus on the dynamics of the $N$ rightmost particles. In the limit $q \to 1$ and at large time (and large gaps) we identify a new intermediate "mesoscopic" (i.e. finite $N$) regime which corresponds to weak noise. In that regime Poisson noise remains important. We obtain the large deviations of the position of a given particle by two methods. The first derives asymptotics of $q$-TASEP Fredholm determinant formula. The second maps the weak noise limit to a system of semi-discrete or fully discrete, non linear differential equations. These are obtained as saddle point classical equations of a dynamical field theory, and their solutions represent the optimal configurations in the large deviation regime. We show the classical integrability of these two systems, and exhibit their explicit Lax pair. In the case of the continuous time $q$-TASEP it provides the first instance of classical integrability arising in a stochastic system, with signatures of the Poisson noise persisting in the weak noise limit. For this model, we solve the scattering problem associated to its Lax pair and fully characterize the large deviations associated to the weak noise theory. Finally, we supplement this work with an Appendix on the first cumulant method to obtain the large deviations of several lattice polymer models (Strict Weak, Log Gamma, Beta).

Abstract: We investigate superconductivity in KTaO$_3$ (KTO)-based two-dimensional electron gases for the (001), (110), and (111) crystallographic orientations within a unified microscopic framework. Using a self-consistent tight-binding slab model, we determine the confinement potential, electronic structure, and orbital composition for each orientation, explicitly including inversion-symmetry-induced orbital Rashba couplings. Using a local spin-singlet s-wave pairing interaction, we find that the pronounced orientation dependence of the superconducting critical temperature primarily originates from differences in the spatial extent of the two-dimensional electron gas and the associated redistribution of the density of states at the Fermi level, rather than from changes in the pairing interaction. Our results provide a microscopic explanation for the experimentally observed orientation dependence of superconductivity at KTO-based interfaces.

Abstract: Atomic-scale disorder is conventionally regarded as detrimental to superconductivity; however, under specific conditions, it can enhance superconducting properties. Here, we investigate the role of substitutional disorder in Remeika-type quasiskutterudites $R_3M_4$Sn$_{13}$ and $R_5M_6$Sn$_{18}$ ($R=$ Y, La, Lu; $M=$ Co, Rh, Ru) by combining measurements of magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity with microscopic modeling. We demonstrate that increasing disorder leads to the emergence of locally superconducting regions characterized by an enhanced critical temperature $T_c^{\ast}$, exceeding the bulk transition temperature $T_c$.
  Both $T_c^\ast$ and $T_c$ exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on dopant concentration and show a strong correlation with entropy isotherms measured as a function of disorder. The pronounced entropy maxima coincide with the largest separation between $T_c^{\ast}$ and $T_c$, establishing disorder as a thermodynamically controlled parameter governing superconductivity in these materials. Measurements of the upper critical field reveal distinct $H_{c2}(T)$ branches associated with the bulk and locally superconducting phases, providing direct experimental evidence for a percolative superconducting state.
  To interpret these observations, we propose a microscopic model that captures the interplay between the impurity-induced enhancement of local pairing and the disorder-driven suppression of global superconducting coherence. The model reproduces the experimentally observed nonmonotonic evolution of $T_c^{\ast}$ with disorder and supports a percolation-based interpretation of the superconducting transition. Our results demonstrate that controlled atomic disorder can serve as an effective materials-design parameter for tuning superconductivity in complex correlated systems.

Abstract: Cooper-pair density modulation (CPDM) states are superconducting phases in which the order parameter varies periodically in real space without breaking translational symmetry. Recently, moire superlattices in layered materials have emerged as powerful platforms for engineering charge density with tunable lattice symmetry, offering a new route to creating and controlling CPDM states. In this work, we demonstrate moire-induced CPDM states in a bilayer heterostructure formed by epitaxially stacking one quintuple layer (1 QL) of topological insulator Sb2Te3 on a six-unit-cell (6 UC) antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) measurements reveal a moiré superlattice formed between the hexagonal Te lattice of Sb2Te3 and the square Te lattice of FeTe, which spatially modulates the two superconducting gaps of the 1 QL Sb2Te3/6 UC FeTe bilayer. Our Josephson STM/S measurements provide direct real-space imaging of the CPDM states with a wavelength corresponding to the periodicity of the moire superlattice. By substituting Sb2Te3 with Bi2Te3, we achieve control over both the periodicity and magnitude of the CPDM states. Our work demonstrates an epitaxial strategy for synthesizing moire superlattices from materials with different crystal symmetries and reveals a new mechanism for engineering CPDM states in designer bilayer heterostructures.

Abstract: Altermagnets emerge as a novel platform for realizing unconventional superconductivity through their exotic momentum-dependent spin-splitting of electronic band structures. Recent experiments have uncovered a novel form of altermagnetism with distinctive $g$-wave symmetry in CrSb. However, the potential for unconventional superconductivity arising from $g$-wave altermagnetism in such systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we discover the emergence of chiral superconducting states in three-dimensional $g$-wave altermagnetic metals. Through systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with $g$-wave altermagnetic exchange fields in a three-dimensional hexagonal lattice, as observed in CrSb, we find that the altermagnetic spin splitting of Fermi surfaces favors chiral $p$-wave states as the dominant pairing channel under strong altermagnetic fields and high electron densities, while chiral $d$-wave states become predominant under weak altermagnetic fields and intermediate electron densities. Conversely, at weak altermagnetic fields and typical electron densities, non-chiral $s$-, extended $s$-, or $f$-wave states become stabilized. We also showcase the possible experimental detection using the quasiparticle energy dispersions and the density of states to distinguish different pairing symmetries. These findings underscore the potential of $g$-wave altermagnets to host sought-after chiral and gapless superconductivity.

Abstract: Employing a renormalization group analysis that allows for an unbiased treatment of competing physical ingredients, we systematically trace how the interplay between Cooper pairing and disorder scatterings governs the emergence or suppression of Cooper instability in the low-energy regime of fractional Dirac semimetals.In the clean limit, we find that the emergence of Cooper instability requires surpassing a finite interaction threshold $|λ_c|$, and depends sensitively on both the fractional exponent $α$ and the transfer momentum $\mathbf{Q}=(Q,φ)$. Specifically, bigger values of $α$ enhance the tendency toward BCS instability. For $α\in(0.001,0.61)$, the $(Q,φ)$ parameter space separates into two distinct regions: Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}, where Cooper instability is suppressed, and Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}, where it is allowed. In the presence of disorders, we demonstrate that they can either promote or suppress Cooper instability. Disorder of type $Δ_1$ or $Δ_2$ enhances superconductivity by reducing the critical interaction threshold $|λ_c|$ and expanding the superconducting phase space (Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}). In sharp contrast, either $Δ_0$ or $Δ_3$ suppresses Cooper pairing by increasing $|λ_c|$ and shrinking the available phase space (Zone-\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}). Although Cooper instability can be enhanced when promotive disorders ($Δ_1$, $Δ_2$) coexist with a single suppressive disorder ($Δ_0$ or $Δ_3$), the suppressive influence of $Δ_{0,3}$ generally dominates the promotive effects of $Δ_{1,2}$ in the presence of all sorts of disorders. These results would be helpful for further studies of fractional Dirac semimetals and alike materials.

Abstract: Quantum interference phenomena in superconductors, such as Josephson interference and Little-Parks oscillations, serve as powerful probes of phase coherence, symmetry breaking and vortex dynamics. However, they are typically observed in well-defined mesoscopic structures, and their behavior in the two-dimensional limit remains largely unexplored. Here, we report periodic magnetoresistance oscillations, superconducting interference patterns, and interfering diode effect in unpatterned few-layer NbSe2. These phenomena emerge exclusively within the superconducting fluctuation regime of thin samples, consistent with the enhanced anomalous metallic behavior of atomically thin NbSe2. The non-monotonic temperature dependence of both the oscillation amplitude and the diode efficiency can be captured by a model in which thermally activated vortices traverse intrinsic supercurrent loops. Our results reveal that the observed interference phenomena originate from the lost of global phase coherence, providing a new route to accessing interference effects in unpatterned superconductors.
