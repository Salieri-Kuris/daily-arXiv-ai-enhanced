Here, we present a high-resolution, time- and angle-resolved photoemission study of the near-antinodal region of optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\u03b4}$. For a sufficiently high excitation fluence, we disrupt superconductivity and drive a transient change from a symmetric superconducting-like to an asymmetric pseudogap-like density of states, for electronic temperatures well below the equilibrium superconducting critical temperature. Conversely, when the superconductivity is fully restored, the pseudogap is suppressed, as signaled by a fully particle-hole symmetric density of states. A unique aspect of our experiments is that the pseudogap coexists with superconducting features at intermediate times or at intermediate fluence. Our findings challenge the paradigm that superconductivity emerges by establishing phase coherence in the pseudogap.

By quantifying how fluctuations at distinct spatial or temporal points are related, correlation functions reveal the structural organization of complex systems. Here, we revisit the theoretical foundations of these correlations in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions, with emphasis on the Ising model extended to non-integer spatial dimensions. Starting from the classical framework introduced by Fisher, we discuss how the standard Euclidean treatment, restricted to integer dimensions, necessitates the introduction of the critical exponent $\u03b7$ to capture the spatial decay of correlations at $T=T_c$. We suppose that, at criticality, the equilibrium dynamics become effectively confined to the fractal edge of spin clusters. Within this framework, the fractal dimension that governs the correlations in that subspace is directly related to Fisher exponent, which quantifies the singular behavior of the correlation function near criticality. Importantly, this correlation fractal dimension is distinct from the fractal dimension associated with the order parameter. We further derive an explicit geometrical relation connecting the two fractal dimensions, thereby linking spatial self-similarity to the observed scaling behavior at criticality. This treatment naturally extends to non-integer spatial dimensions, which remain valid below the upper critical dimension and produce the correct value of Fisher exponent $\u03b7$ for a continuous space dimension.

This theoretical prediction typically relies on an oversimplified model, where both the nanowire and the superconductor are idealized as one-dimensional systems. In reality, heterostructures have finite sizes that deviate from this idealization-and as a result, smoking-gun evidence confirming the existence of these zero modes remains elusive. Here, we investigate the finite-size effects of both the nanowire and the superconductor, and optimize their sizes to ensure that only one Majorana fermion exists at each end of the heterostructure. It is discovered that the optimal transverse sizes of the nanowire are less than 100nm in width and approximately 1nm in thickness. For the superconductor layer, its optimal thickness (a key aspect of its size) must exceed its coherence length.

Using an Aer-based emulator calibrated with ibm_fez device parameters, Aurora-DD achieves substantial reductions in mean-squared error of the measured expectation value <Z>, yielding 68-97% improvement across phase settings phi = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 over n=30 randomized trials. These large-n emulator results provide statistically stable evidence that the combined effect of XY8 and Delta phi* suppresses both dephasing and systematic phase bias. On real superconducting hardware (ibm_fez), we perform a small-sample (n=3) multi-phase validation campaign. Aurora-DD yields point estimates corresponding to approximately 99.2-99.6% reduction in absolute error relative to a no-DD baseline across all tested phase points. These hardware numbers are reported transparently as feasibility evidence under tight queue and credit constraints. In contrast, the auxiliary Aurora+ZNE branch exhibits instability: shallow two-point ZNE occasionally amplifies calibration inconsistencies and produces large error outliers. We therefore relegate ZNE analysis to the Appendix and position Aurora-DD (without ZNE) as the primary contribution.

Beginning with a static nudged elastic band path, PCCANN extracts a committor-consistent string to represent the reactive ensemble. We illustrate the power of this methodology through two representative applications. First, we investigate an SNAr reaction using MACE trained at hybrid DFT level with implicit solvent. The mechanism is found to be concerted, and the dynamic approach reveals a lower barrier than static treatments. Second, we apply the same protocol to the isomerization of protonated isobutanol to protonated 2-butanol, yielding a quantitatively accurate free-energy landscape.

For methods that characterize electromagnetic effects, these numerical methods are referred to as computational electromagnetics (CEM) methods.

The design of superconducting circuit quantum devices falls in this category due to the unconventional material properties and important features of the devices covering nanometer to centimeter scales. Such multiscale devices can stress the fundamental properties of CEM tools which can lead to an increase in simulation times, a loss in accuracy, or even cause no solution to be reliably found. While these challenges are being investigated by CEM researchers, knowledge about them is limited in the broader community of users of these CEM tools. This review is meant to serve as a practical introduction to the fundamental aspects of the major CEM techniques that a researcher may need to choose between to model a device, as well as provide insight into what steps they may take to alleviate some of their challenges. Our focus is on highlighting the main concepts without rigorously deriving all the details, which can be found in many textbooks and articles.

We develop a pipeline for compiling logical algorithms to physical circuits implementing lattice surgery on the surface code, and use this pipeline to identify the requirements for achieving algorithmic break-even -- where quantum error correction improves the performance of a quantum algorithm -- for two prominent quantum algorithms: the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum phase estimation (QPE).

A major challenge, however, lies in their inherently substantial sampling cost, primarily due to the individual measurement of each term in the Hamiltonian. While various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, the sampling overhead remains a significant bottleneck, especially for practical large-scale electronic structure problems. In this work, we introduce an alternative method, dubbed mirror subspace diagonalization (MSD), which approaches the theoretical lower bound of the sampling cost for quantum Krylov algorithms. MSD leverages a finite-difference formula to express the Hamiltonian operator as a linear combination of time-evolution unitaries with symmetrically shifted timesteps, enabling efficient estimation of the Hamiltonian matrix within the Krylov subspace. In this scheme, the finite difference and statistical errors are simultaneously minimized by optimizing the timestep parameter and shifting the energy spectrum. Consequently, MSD attains the lower bound of the sampling cost of the quantum Krylov algorithms up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, we employ classical post-processing to infer Hamiltonian moments, which are used to mitigate the ground state energy error based on the Lanczos scheme. Through theoretical analysis of the sampling cost, we demonstrate that MSD is particularly effective when the spectral norm of the Hamiltonian is significantly smaller than its 1-norm. Such a situation arises, for example, in high-accuracy simulations of molecules using large basis sets that incorporate strong electronic correlations.

Recent advances in quantum computing offer a promising alternative, leveraging quantum algorithms to efficiently explore complex solution spaces and potentially outperform classical methods in high-dimensional settings. However, conventional quantum approaches typically assume a one-to-one correspondence between qubits and variables (e.g. financial assets), which severely limits the applicability of gate-based quantum systems due to current hardware constraints. As a result, only quantum annealing-like methods have been used in realistic scenarios. In this work, we show how a gate-based variational quantum algorithm can be applied to a real-world portfolio optimization problem by assigning multiple variables per qubit. Specifically, we address a problem involving over 250 variables, where the market graph representing a real stock market is iteratively partitioned into sub-portfolios of highly correlated assets. This approach enables improved scalability compared to traditional variational methods and opens new possibilities for quantum-enhanced financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u95e8\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0e\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u95e8\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5e02\u573a\u56fe\u8fed\u4ee3\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b50\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5bf9\u5e94\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d89\u53ca250\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u53d8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u95e8\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u5206\u914d\u591a\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the stability of the superradiant phase in the presence of a weak spin relaxation. We find that even a weak spin relaxation can render the superradiant phase to a superradiant metastable phase, in which symmetry-breaking states are stable only for a finite time. This arises because each spin-jump induced by relaxation applies as a strong perturbation to the system, potentially driving the system from a symmetry-breaking state to the symmetry-preserving saddle point with finite probability, before it eventually relaxes back to a symmetry-breaking state. Such dynamical processes lead to a finite lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states and restore the symmetry in the steady state. To substantiate these results, we combine mean-field and cumulant expansion analyses with exact numerical simulations. The lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states are analyzed in finite-size systems, and the conclusions are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit via finite-size scaling. Our findings establish the metastable nature of the symmetry-breaking states in the dissipative quantum Rabi model and reveal the complexity of the dissipative phase transition beyond their equilibrium counterpart. The mechanisms uncovered here can be generalized to a broad class of open quantum systems, highlighting fundamental distinctions between equilibrium phase transitions and steady-state phase transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "The dissipative quantum Rabi model shows metastable symmetry-breaking states under weak spin relaxation, revealing complex dynamics beyond equilibrium phase transitions.", "motivation": "To understand the stability of the superradiant phase in the dissipative quantum Rabi model under weak spin relaxation and explore its dynamical processes.", "method": "Mean-field and cumulant expansion analyses combined with exact numerical simulations were used to investigate the system.

The central innovation is a conserved coherence current operator constructed from the Noether mass current via operator-level coarse-graining. This current vanishes for classical matter distributions but is nonzero for spatial superpositions and entangled states, yielding a gauge interaction that is dormant in classical regimes but activated by quantum coherence. The framework predicts three distinctive signatures: (i) interferometric phase shifts scaling linearly with fringe visibility, (ii) decoherence rates with characteristic m^2 scaling and spatial dependence distinct from collapse models, and (iii) entanglement-selective forces between distant massive qubits. The theory maintains full gauge invariance, causality, and positive time evolution. We show that state-of-the-art atom interferometers and levitated nanoparticles can place first constraints on this interaction class, complementary to classical fifth-force searches. This approach provides a novel theoretical framework for probing coherence-selective fundamental interactions and their potential role in the quantum-classical transition. To make this more concrete, we also spell out a simple benchmark latent-field model and work out, in detail, how a representative large-momentum-transfer atom interferometer constrains the corresponding coupling strength.", "AI": {"tldr": "A hidden U(1) gauge interaction selectively activates for quantum coherence in massive systems, with unique signatures detectable via interferometry and entanglement.", "motivation": "The motivation is to explore a hidden U(1) gauge interaction that selectively couples to quantum coherence in massive systems, distinguishing classical and quantum regimes.", "method": "The method involves constructing a conserved coherence current operator from the Noether mass current via operator-level coarse-graining.
