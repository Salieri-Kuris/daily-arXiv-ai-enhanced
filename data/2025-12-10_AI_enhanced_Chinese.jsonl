Submitted to Physica C: Superconductivity and its Applications (2025)", "summary": "In contrast to the extensive literature on thin tunnel junctions and traditional SQUID geometries, there is almost no quantitative experimental data on magnetic control of the Josephson phase in thick SNS weak links. The standard view is that in such compact structures without macroscopic loops the local magnetic coupling to the phase is negligibly small, which in practice forces one to use bulky SQUID devices for phase control. We show that this view is overly restrictive. We consider a thick SNS bridge with an on-chip microcoil placed directly above it, which controls the Josephson phase via strong phase-flux coupling enhanced near the Josephson plasma resonance. In the proposed configuration realistic thick SNS weak links, with normal-layer thickness d of order xi, can achieve phase-flux efficiencies of order 30-60 percent of an ideal dc SQUID. Within a standard RSJ/RCSJ model and linear circuit theory we show that this unexpectedly strong coupling arises from the combination of a large kinetic inductance of the thick SNS bridge and resonant amplification of about 15-35 dB, rather than from any exotic microphysics. The proposed experiment, a comparative analysis of Shapiro steps driven by a direct RF signal and by the magnetic field of the same microcoil, provides a direct and quantitative method to measure the phase-flux response of a thick SNS junction. If confirmed experimentally, such structures may become compact phase elements capable of locally controlling the Josephson phase without a macroscopic loop and enabling dense, locally addressable phase control in superconducting quantum circuits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Thick SNS junctions exhibit strong phase-flux coupling, potentially enabling compact phase control in superconducting circuits.", "motivation": "To address the lack of quantitative experimental data on magnetic control of the Josephson phase in thick SNS weak links, contrary to the belief that such control is negligibly small in compact structures.", "method": "The study uses a thick SNS bridge with an on-chip microcoil and analyzes phase-flux coupling near the Josephson plasma resonance within a standard RSJ/RCSJ model and linear circuit theory.", "result": "Thick SNS weak links achieve phase-flux efficiencies of 30-60% of an ideal dc SQUID, driven by large kinetic inductance and resonant amplification (15-35 dB), without exotic microphysics.", "conclusion": "If confirmed experimentally, thick SNS junctions may become compact phase elements for dense, locally addressable phase control in superconducting quantum circuits."}}

By analyzing some experiments and performing calculations, we provide a full interpretation of their properties; from the undoped insulator to the overdoped metallic compounds. The variation of the anomalous Hall coefficient ($R_{\\rm H}(T)$) with temperature at half-filling ($n = 1$) and, combinations of undoped ($p = 0$) insulators and metallic films, which, among other things, are indicative of a thermodynamic transition. On the overdoped side, recent experiments near the superconducting-to-metal transition detecting superconducting puddles and a considerable degree of charge disorder, suggest that a similar thermodynamic transition operates at all doping levels. We propose a spinodal or charge-separation transition starting near the pseudogap temperature $T^*(p)$, which among other things generates the CDW domains with a typical double-well Landau free-energy functional. Thus, from the half-filled to the overdoped region, the free energy forms an array of wells with $n = 1$ {\\it static} holes. With doping, {\\it mobile} holes tend to occupy these wells with alternating high and low densities, generating the CDW pattern. The confined holes in small regions develop local superconducting amplitudes, giving rise to a mesoscopic granular superconductor. Similar to the XY model, the grains develop correlation effects mediated by Josephson coupling, which is proportional to the local superfluid density. This approach yields a unified theory of cuprate superconductors.", "AI": {"tldr": "A unified theory for cuprate superconductors explains CDW domains and granular superconductivity via a thermodynamic transition linked to the pseudogap.", "motivation": "To address the lack of a complete theory for cuprate superconductors despite years of research and discoveries like the pseudogap and charge density waves.", "method": "Analysis of experiments and calculations focusing on the anomalous Hall coefficient, undoped insulators, metallic films, and superconducting puddles.", "result": "A thermodynamic transition starting near the pseudogap temperature generates CDW domains and local superconducting amplitudes, forming a mesoscopic granular superconductor.", "conclusion": "The paper proposes a unified theory of cuprate superconductors, suggesting that a spinodal or charge-separation transition generates CDW domains and leads to mesoscopic granular superconductivity mediated by Josephson coupling."}}

A prominent negative magnetoresistivity is observed at low magnetic field with preserved mirror symmetry and disappears at high magnetic field, which is correlated to the chiral anomaly and its annihilation of Weyl nodal ring, respectively.

This is possible because the tunneling current under the tip is an extremely localized electrical excitation source. However, in most STML applications, the spatial distribution of the emission relative to the excitation point is unresolved. Yet this distribution contains key information about how the interaction of excitons with injected charge carriers affects the luminescence of these materials, and about exciton transport. Resolving this spatial distribution at the nanoscale is relevant both for a fundamental understanding of exciton physics and for device applications; yet it remains a significant challenge. In this work, we resolve the spatial distribution of the emission beyond the diffraction limit of light by deconvolving real-space optical microscopy images of the STML using an iterative algorithm, i.e., Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution. To showcase this technique, we apply it to the STML of monolayer tungsten diselenide ($\\mathrm{WSe_2}$) and tungsten disulfide ($\\mathrm{WS_2}$). Thus, we highlight hitherto ignored or misunderstood aspects of STML on 2D semiconductors related to exciton and charge carrier transport, namely the dependence of the spatial distribution of emission on the tunnel current setpoint and the origin of the emission from hot spots located micrometers from the excitation source.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528RL\u53bb\u5377\u79ef\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u67902D\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53STML\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6fc0\u5b50\u4e0e\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSTML\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5bf9\u6fc0\u5b50\u4e0e\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u6fc0\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Richardson-Lucy (RL) \u53bb\u5377\u79ef\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9STML\u7684\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149\u5b66\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u4e86\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5355\u5c42WSe2\u548cWS2\u5728STML\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53d1\u5c04\u70ed\u70b9\u4e0e\u96a7\u9053\u7535\u6d41\u8bbe\u5b9a\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fdc\u79bb\u6fc0\u53d1\u6e90\u7684\u53d1\u5149\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7RL\u53bb\u5377\u79ef\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u6790\u4e862D\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53STML\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6fc0\u5b50\u548c\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

For any representation of a finite group, we produce a quantum code with a code space invariant under the group action, providing passive error mitigation against errors belonging to the image of the representation. Furthermore, errors outside this scope are detected and diagnosed by performing a projective measurement onto the isotypic components corresponding to irreducible representations of the chosen group, effectively generalizing syndrome extraction to symmetry-resolved quantum measurements.

They are free-fermionic ($N=2$) and free-parafermionic ($N\\geq 2$) quantum chains. The essential ingredient that implies the free-particle spectra is the fact that these Hamiltonians are expressed in terms of generators of a $Z(N)$ exchange algebra. In all these known quantum chains the number of spins in all the multispin interactions (range of interactions) is the same and therefore, the models have homogeneous interacting range. In this paper we extend the $Z(N)$ exchange algebra, by introducing new models with a free-particle spectra, where the interaction ranges of the multispin interactions are not uniform anymore and depends on the lattice sites (non-homogeneous interacting range).

The entire temporal evolution is then solved as a single large linear system using the history state method, which avoids the measurement bottleneck of conventional time-marching schemes and fully leverages the advantages of quantum linear system algorithms. To extract the quantity of interest from the resulting quantum state, we develop an efficient algorithm to measure the statistical moments of the PDF, bypassing the need for costly full-state tomography.

SM: 39 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Active systems across scales, ranging from molecular machines to human crowds, are usually modeled as assemblies of self-propelled particles driven by internally generated forces. However, these models often assume memoryless dynamics and no coupling of internal active forces to the environment. Here, guided by the example of living cells, which have recently been shown to display multi-timescale memory effects, we introduce a general theoretical framework that goes beyond this paradigm by incorporating internal state dynamics and environmental sensing into active particle models. We show that when the self-propulsion of an agent depends on internal variables with their own complex dynamics - modulated by local environmental cues - environmental memory spontaneously emerges and gives rise to new classes of behaviours.

Single-qubit control and readout have been demonstrated recently using SFQ circuits coupled to superconducting qubits. Experiments where the SFQ electronics are co-located with the qubit have suffered from excess decoherence and loss due to quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit. A previous experiment by our group showed that moving the control electronics to the 3 K stage of the dilution refrigerator avoided this source of decoherence in a high-coherence 3D transmon geometry. In this paper, we also generate the pulses at the 3 K stage but have optimized the qubit design and control lines for scalable 2D transmon devices. We directly compare the qubit lifetime $T_1$, coherence time $T_2^*$ and gate fidelity when the qubit is controlled by the Josephson pulse generator (JPG) circuit versus the TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations for $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, and agreement to within 10% for randomized benchmarking. We also performed interleaved randomized benchmarking on individual JPG gates demonstrating an average error per gate of $0.46$% showing good agreement with what is expected based on the qubit coherence and higher-state leakage.

While this phenomenon has so far been studied in two-photon systems, exchange symmetries and interference effects in multi-photon scenarios remain largely unexplored. In this work, we show that multi-photon states uncover a rich landscape of exchange symmetries. With three photons already, multiple pairwise combinations are possible, where each pair of photons can exhibit either bosonic, fermionic, or anyonic exchange symmetry. This gives rise to mixed symmetry systems that are not possible to achieve with two photon alone.

For over a century, this question has been explored through examining violations of the empirical ``rectilinear diameter law'' for the subcritical coexistence curve, where asymmetry could generate singular corrections. Here, we extend this investigation to the supercritical regime. We propose a supercritical-subcritical correspondence, drawing a formal analogy between the subcritical coexistence curve and recently defined supercritical boundary lines ($L^\\pm$ lines).

While this enables studies of many-body physics, it limits the flexibility and tunability of the system as a quantum platform. Here, we demonstrate an array of trapped ions in individual trapping sites whose motional modes can be controllably coupled and decoupled by tuning the local applied confining potential for each ion. We show that a single motional quantum, or phonon, can be coherently shared among two or three ions confined at the vertices of an equilateral triangle 30 $\u03bc$m on a side. We can adiabatically tune the ion participation in the motional modes around a closed contour in configuration space, observing that the single-phonon wavefunction acquires a topological Berry phase if the contour encircles a conical intersection of motional eigenvalue surfaces. We observe this phase by single-phonon interference and study its breakdown as the motional mode tuning becomes non-adiabiatic.

While the mathematical theory underpinning quantum correlations between spacelike separated systems has been well-established since the 1930s, the mathematical theory for correlations between non-spacelike separated systems is much less developed. In this work, we develop the theory of what we refer to as \"local-density operators\", which we view as joint states for possibly non-spacelike separated quantum systems. Local-density operators are unit trace operators whose marginals are genuine density operators, which we show not only subsumes the notion of density operator, but also several extensions of the notion of density operator into the spatiotemporal domain, such as pseudo-density operators and quantum states over time. More importantly, we prove a result which establishes a one-to-one correspondence between local-density operators and what we refer to as \"Dirac measures\", which are complex-valued measures on the space of separable projectors associated with two quantum systems. In the case that one of the systems is the trivial quantum system with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, our result recovers the fundamental result known as Gleason's Theorem, which implies that the Born rule from quantum theory is the only way in which one may assign probabilities to the outcomes of measurements performed on quantum systems in a non-contextual manner.

As the community broadens its focus from the initial sampling task to possible real-world applications, it becomes crucial to quantify the performance cost associated with reducing non-Gaussian resources and to benchmark sampling platforms that employ different input states.\n  To address this need, we introduce the Paderborn Quantum Sampler (PaQS), a hybrid platform capable of performing sampling experiments with eight Gaussian or non-Gaussian input states in a 12-mode interferometer within a single experimental run.

These purely syntactic requirements define a minimal descriptive cost, interpretable as a smoothed minimal program length, that is additive over local segments. First, any continuous local additive cost whose stationary sector coincides with the empirically identified classical variational sector is forced into a unique Euler--Lagrange equivalence class. Hence the universal form of an action is fixed by descriptional structure alone, while the specific microscopic Lagrangian and couplings remain system-dependent semantic input. Second, independently of microscopic stochasticity, finite prefix-free languages exhibit exponential redundancy: many distinct programs encode the same coarse history, and this redundancy induces a universal exponential multiplicity weight on histories.

The setup consists of a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere, which in turn are hybridized with a vibrational mechanical mode through magnetostrictive interaction. In the Hermitian regime, strong photon-magnon coupling generates a single transparency window in the cavity transmission, which splits into a doublet when the magnon is coherently hybridized with the mechanical mode via magnomechanical coupling. This establishes a versatile platform in which the transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response using experimentally accessible, scaled magnomechanical interactions. When a non-Hermitian coupling is introduced, the system enters a parity-time-broken regime in which the transparency ceases to be purely passive and becomes gain assisted, leading to asymmetric transmission with amplification on one side of the resonance and enhanced absorption on the other. By tuning the cavity detuning, we convert magnomechanical transparency into Fano-type line shapes with strongly non-Lorentzian phase dispersion and map their deformation into asymmetric, gain-assisted Fano ridges in the joint space of probe and magnon detunings. Finally, we analyze the associated group delay and show that both slow- and fast-light behavior can be widely tuned by varying the photon-magnon and magnomechanical couplings together with the non-Hermitian strength, highlighting parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a promising platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Magnomechanical transparency in parity-time-symmetric systems enables tunable multi-window response and asymmetric transmission, useful for quantum signal processing.", "motivation": "To explore the potential of magnomechanical systems in quantum signal processing and sensing by investigating magnomechanically induced transparency and its tunability in parity-time-symmetric regimes.", "method": "The setup involves a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a yttrium iron garnet sphere, hybridized with a mechanical mode via magnetostrictive interaction.
