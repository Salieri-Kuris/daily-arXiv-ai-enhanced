Standard Wiseman--Milburn feedback offers only modest improvement because it acts on a single measured quadrature and its corrective drive is degraded by loop delay.

A Lindblad treatment yields closed-form effective decay rates: the ancilla suppresses the emission channel by a cooperativity factor, while the predictor further suppresses the residual decay in proportion to forecast quality.

We analyze a fluctuating harmonic potential in which return trajectories are forcibly terminated the moment the particle reaches the origin, ensuring that all outward (diffusive) trajectories begin from the same point. This is implemented through instantaneous positional information: a feedback signal that shortens the return phase without incurring additional mechanical energetic cost. We examine several search protocols built on this controlled return mechanism and determine their mean first-passage times (MFPTs).

While surface codes are well understood in terms of their logical operators and boundary behavior, much less is known about tile codes. In this work, we establish a natural and precise description of their logical operator space. We prove that, under mild assumptions, any tile code admits a canonical symplectic basis of logical operators supported along lattice boundaries, which can be generated efficiently by a simple cellular automaton with the number of update rules only depending on the non-locality of the tile code. Further, we develop algebraic and algebro-geometric frameworks for tile codes, by resolving them by translationally invariant Pauli stabilizer models and showing that they arise as derived sections of a Koszul complex on $\\mathbb{P}^1 \\times \\mathbb{P}^1$. Finally, we introduce the concept of derived automorphisms for quantum codes. These are automorphism-like operations that can exist even for codes that do not have symmetries. We explain how derived automorphisms can be implemented for tile codes in a low-overhead and fault-tolerant manner by extending the lattice on one side and shrinking it on the other.
