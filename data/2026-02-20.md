Abstract: Magnetization dynamics is commonly described by the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. On picosecond timescales, inertial and open-system extensions of the LLG equation are necessary to interpret recent experiments. We show analytically and numerically that the standard LLG equation exhibits strictly positive entropy production rates, while inertial and open-system LLG dynamics display temporarily negative entropy production rates indicating non-Markovianity. Here we quantify the degree of non-Markovianity using established measures. Our numerical calculations show that the open-system LLG equation consistently exhibits the highest magnitude of non-Markovianity for different initial conditions and magnetic field orientations.

Abstract: We revisit the construction of the fermionic path-integral representation of overdamped scalar Langevin processes with multiplicative white noise, focusing on the covariance of the generating functional under non-linear changes of variables. We identify the transformations of the auxiliary (commuting and anticommuting) variables that ensure covariance under such transformations. The subtleties induced by the non-differentiable trajectories of the stochastic dynamics are encoded in the fermionic statistics. Upon integrating out the auxiliary variables, we derive the Onsager-Machlup formulation, which agrees with the one recently obtained using a higher-order discretization scheme. In contrast to the latter, the construction proposed here is formulated directly in continuous time.

Abstract: Matrix-product operators (MPOs) appear throughout the study of integrable lattice models, notably as the transfer matrices. They can also be used as transformations to construct dualities between such models, both invertible (including unitary) and non-invertible (including discrete gauging). We analyse how the local Yang--Baxter integrable structures are modified under such dualities. We see that the $\check{R}$-matrix, that appears in the baxterization approach to integrability, transforms in a simple manner. We further show for a broad class of MPOs that the usual Yang--Baxter $R$-matrix satisfies a modified algebra, previously identified in the unitary case, that gives a local integrable structure underlying the commuting transfer matrices of the dual model. We illustrate these results with two case studies, analysing an invertible unitary MPO and a non-invertible MPO both applied to the canonical XXZ spin chain. The former is the cluster entangler, arising in the study of symmetry-protected topological phases, while the latter is the Kramers--Wannier duality. We show several results for MPOs with exact MPO inverses that are of independent interest.

Abstract: Recent experimental investigations have demonstrated that doping a semiconductor is a route to increase the thermal boundary conductance at metal/semiconductor interfaces. In this work, the influence of the electrical properties on heat transfer across metal/doped semiconductor junctions is investigated. Specifically, thermal boundary conductance at the interfaces between p- and n-doped silicon and titanium is measured by employing frequency-domain photothermal radiometry under varying external conditions. The influence of the doping level of the semiconductor, the barrier height, and the space charge area is analyzed. In particular, a 40% increase in the interface thermal conductance with the application of a current at n-doped silicon/titanium interfaces is reported. The enhancement of the thermal boundary conductance is explained by the shrinking of the surface charga area induced by the electric current. This study opens the way to modulating interfacial heat transfer at metal/semiconductor interfaces through fine tuning of electrical effects.

Abstract: Hydrodynamic electrons in high-mobility graphene devices have demonstrated great potential in establishing an electronic analogue of relativistic quantum fluid in solid-state systems. One of the key requirements for observing viscous electron flow in an electronic channel is a large momentum-relaxation path, a process primarily limited by electron-impurity/phonon scattering in graphene. Over the past decade, multiple complex device geometries have been successfully employed to suppress momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms; however, experimental observations have been found to be sensitive to the device fabrication process and architecture, raising questions about the signature of electron hydrodynamics itself. Here, we present a study on multiple ultra-clean graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) in a simple, rectangular four-terminal device architecture. Using electrical transport measurements, we have characterised the pristine quality of the graphene FETs and examined the variation of electrical resistance in the doped regime as a function of carrier density and temperature. Our results reveal strong device-dependent variability even in the most simple architecture that we attribute to competing momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms, as well as coupling to contacts. Further, we have proposed a phenomenological method for analysing the results, which yields transport parameters in accordance with recent experiments. This simple experimental strategy and analysis can serve as an efficient tool for extracting the viscous electronic contribution in state-of-the-art high-mobility graphene FETs.

Abstract: Pinning magnetization in a ferromagnetic thin film is commonly realized through exchange biasing with an adjacent antiferromagnet. Field-cooling from above the Néel temperature is a reliable yet slow re-pinning method in exchange-biased systems. For on-demand reprogrammable devices, localized and rapid exchange bias repinning methods are essential. Recent work has shown that femtosecond laser pulses enable field-free reversal of exchange bias in tailored multilayer stacks. Contrary to field-cooling, our experiments with ultrafast excitation reach hitherto unexplored regimes in the exchange bias setting process. Here, we unravel these observations by considering both ultrafast magnetization dynamics on the femto- to picosecond timescale and slow heat-driven dynamics on millisecond timescales and upwards. We develop a microscopic framework of exchange bias setting in a polycrystalline antiferromagnetic thin film like IrMn that provides a complete description of the observations in our present experiments and those found in literature. We expand the use of our model by identifying material platforms and stack designs that lead to optimized performance, aiding further development of optically reprogrammable devices.

Abstract: The maturity of the chemical vapor deposition graphene-based device processing has increased from chip level demonstrations to wafer-scale fabrication in the past few years. Due to this wafer-scale, electrical characterization and analysis of the fabricated devices has become increasingly important to enable extraction of multiple parameters with minimal number of measurements for the quality control purposes critical for industrial uptake of 2D materials-based devices. As a crucial step, we demonstrate optimization of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) fabrication and analysis including the gate stack, bottom contact, graphene patterning and encapsulation process steps. The analysis methods include atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and most importantly electrical characterization. The electrical characterization focuses on comparing different test structures and extraction methods for mobility, contact resistance, IV-curve hysteresis and doping parameters. The comparison shows that the selected measurement test structures and analysis methods can have a large impact on the extracted values and should thus be considered when comparing data sets between different sources. The analysis shows that the optimized process offers high device yield of 98 % with good doping uniformity, contact resistance and mobility as well as low IV-curve hysteresis values on 200 mm wafers.

Abstract: Reconstructing complex magnetization textures from nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry stray-field measurements presents a challenging inverse problem. In this work, we introduce a physics-informed method that addresses this by incorporating the full micromagnetic energy directly into the variational formulation. Built on a PyTorch backend, our forward model integrates an auto-differentiable finite-differences micromagnetic framework with FFT-based stray-field calculations and Fourier-space upward continuation. This enables efficient gradient-based optimization via the adjoint method and allows the sensor-sample distance to be treated as an optimization parameter. By doing so, we eliminate the experimental uncertainty arising from unknown NV implantation depths and surface oxidation layers. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates high-fidelity reconstruction of spin textures and precise sensor height estimation. Furthermore, when applied to NV measurements of the van der Waals ferromagnet $Fe_{3-x}GaTe_2$, the method reconstructs the previously unknown NV-sample distance and physically plausible magnetization textures, which accurately reproduce the experimental observations.

Abstract: The current-induced vibrational dynamics is a key factor determining the stability of molecular nanojunctions. Beyond conventional Joule heating, a different mechanism caused by nonconservative current-induced forces has been predicted for models with multiple vibrational modes, leading to vibrational instabilities already at low bias voltages. So far, this mechanism has only been investigated in models with harmonic nuclear potentials. Consequently, a natural question is whether this effect can also be observed in more realistic models containing anharmonic nuclear potentials, and, if so, whether it has a measurable impact on observables such as the junction dissociation probability. In this work, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to various anharmonic two-mode systems. By performing Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics, we investigate the influence of anharmonicity on instabilities arising from nonconservative forces and the corresponding dissociation dynamics of the junction, as well as steady-state observables, such as the electronic current.

Abstract: Interfacial orbital transport remains far less understood than its bulk counterpart despite its central role in orbitronic experiments. Here, we theoretically investigate the transmission and conversion of orbital angular momentum across a metallic interface using a model Hamiltonian incorporating crystal-field effects. We show that an injected orbital dipole moment undergoes pronounced oscillations driven by the crystal field and generates characteristic quadrupole moments determined by the orbital orientation relative to the interface. Unlike spin precession, the dipole relaxes toward a finite value away from the interface. We further quantify interfacial orbital memory loss and demonstrate that orbital absorption produces a sizable mechanical torque obtained from the orbital continuity equation.

Abstract: Moiré semiconductors built on angle-aligned transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterobilayers provide a physical realization of the Kondo lattice model, in which one TMD layer is prepared in a Mott insulating state supporting a lattice of local magnetic moments and the other layer in a metallic state supporting itinerant carriers. The artificial Kondo lattice enables the exploration of exotic states of matter near a continuously tunable Kondo breakdown. Here we report the emergence of a symmetry-broken Chern insulator at a moiré hole filling factor 4/3 in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers, which realize a chiral Kondo lattice. The symmetry-broken Chern insulator, which exhibits integer quantized Hall conductance at a fractional moiré filling, breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice spontaneously; it also appears only near a magnetic field-induced Kondo breakdown in the mixed-valence regime of the material. We further demonstrate that the magnetic field required to induce the Kondo breakdown and to stabilize the symmetry-broken Chern insulator is twist angle dependent. The results present new opportunities for exploring the subtle interplay between topology and Kondo interactions in moiré semiconductors.

Abstract: We investigate charge and energy transport in monolayer graphene with smooth finite-range disorder, modeled by soft impurity potentials. Using a continuum Dirac model, we go beyond the Born approximation by computing the exact scattering matrix for individual impurities. This captures the full nonperturbative physics of smooth disorder. From the exact scattering data, we evaluate transport coefficients by solving the Boltzmann equation with energy-resolved phase shifts. We analyze electrical and electronic thermal conductivities versus carrier density and temperature, including deviations from the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results reveal that finite-range disorder nontrivially modifies charge and heat currents, especially at low energies where perturbative methods fail. These findings provide a more accurate transport characterization for disordered Dirac materials and clarify how smooth disorder governs energy flow in graphene.

Abstract: We propose a strategy to obtain conducting organic materials with fully spin-polarized Fermi surface, lying at a singular flat band, with antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic moments that reside in pi-orbitals of nanographenes. We consider a honeycomb crystal whose unit cell combines two different molecules with S=1/2: an Aza-3-Triangulene, a molecule with orbital degeneracy, and a 2-Triangulene. The analyzed system is half-metallic with a ferrimagnetic order, presenting a zero net total magnetic moment per unit cell. We combine density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard model Hamiltonian to compute the magnetic interactions, the bands, the intrinsic Anomalous Hall effect, and the collective spin excitations. We obtain very large intermolecular exchange couplings, in the range of 50 meV, which ensures room temperature stability. When the magnetization is off-plane, intrinsic spin orbit coupling in graphene opens up a topological gap that, despite being very small, leads to a quantized Hall conductance in the tens of mK range. Above 1 Kelvin, the system will behave like a half-metal with fully compensated magnetic moments, thereby combining two characteristics that make it ideal for spintronics applications.

Abstract: We introduce millimeter-wave silicon photonic crystal cavities as a versatile platform for the perturbative sensing of nanoscale materials. This dielectric-based platform is compatible with strong magnetic fields, opening avenues for studying quantum materials in extreme environments where superconducting cavities cannot operate. To establish the platform's performance, we cryogenically characterize a silicon photonic crystal cavity at 4.3 K, achieving a total quality factor exceeding $10^5$ for a 96 GHz mode. As a proof-of-concept for its sensing capabilities, we position a hexagonal boron nitride-multilayer graphene (hBN-MLG) heterostructure at an electric-field antinode of the cavity and measure the perturbative response at room temperature. The heterostructure induces a significant change in the cavity's resonance, from which we extract a total sample conductivity of approximately $5.1\times10^6$~S/m. These results establish silicon photonic crystal cavities as a promising platform for sensitive, on-chip spectroscopy of nanoscale materials at millimeter-wave frequencies.

Abstract: We characterize a singularity in the equal-time three-point density correlations that is generic to two-dimensional interacting Fermi liquids. In momentum space where the three-point correlation is determined by two wavevectors $\mathbf{q}_1$ and $\mathbf{q}_2$, the singularity takes the form $|\mathbf{q}_1\times\mathbf{q}_2|$. We explain how this singularity is sharply defined in a long-wavelength collinear limit. For a non-interacting Fermi gas, the coefficient of this singularity is given by the quantized Euler characteristic of the Fermi sea, and it implies a long-range real space correlation favoring collinear configurations. We show that this singularity persists in interacting Fermi liquids, and express the renormalization of the coefficient of singularity in terms of Landau parameters, for both spinless and spinful Fermi liquids. Implications for quantum gas experiments are discussed.

Abstract: We show that the concept of coherent phonon generation by second order response to incident electric laser fields, which is a hallmark of pump-probe spectroscopy on conventional solids, can be expanded to include frustrated quantum magnets. For that purpose, we analyze the Raman force on the shear phonons of a frustrated magnetoelectric bilayer spin system. The bilayer is a stacked triangular magnet, motivated by recently emerging type-II van der Waals multiferroic transition metal dihalides and comprises a spin system which allows for incommensurate spiral order. The magnon excitations are treated by linear spin wave theory. In the spiral state, a finite electric polarization is obtained from the spin-current interaction which induces a coupling of the magnons to the electric field. Scattering of the bilayer shear phonons from the magnons is derived from a magnetoelastic energy. In this scenario, a mixed three-point response function for the Raman force is evaluated. We find it to be strongly anisotropic and very sensitive to the magnon lifetime.

Abstract: We investigate superconductivity emerging in the photodoped Mott insulating Hubbard model using steady-state dynamical mean-field theory implemented on the real-frequency axis. By employing high-order strong-coupling impurity solvers, we obtain the nonequilibrium phase diagram for photoinduced $η$-pairing superconductivity with a remarkably high effective critical temperature. We further identify a superconducting gap in the momentum-resolved spectral function and optical conductivity, providing spectroscopic signatures accessible to experiments. Our results highlight a route to a controllable form of high-temperature superconductivity in nonequilibrium strongly correlated systems, fundamentally distinct from the equilibrium $s$-wave pairing state in the attractive Hubbard model or cuprate-like $d$-wave superconductors.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between lattice symmetry, phonons, and magnetism in the quasi-one-dimensional ladder compound BaFe$_2$S$_3$ by combining polarized synchrotron infrared spectroscopy, hybrid-functional density functional theory calculations, and inelastic neutron scattering. Lattice-dynamics analysis reveals that the crystal symmetry is lower than previously proposed and is consistent with a $P1$ space group at low temperature. Several infrared-active phonon modes exhibit pronounced anomalies at both the structural transition temperature $T_S \approx 125$--$130$~K and the Néel temperature $T_N \approx 95$~K. First-principles calculations show that the modes affected at $T_S$ predominantly involve displacements that modulate magnetic exchange pathways. Neutron scattering demonstrates that below $T_N$ the magnetic order is three-dimensional, long-ranged, and static. Between $T_N$ and $T_S$, the system displays three-dimensional short-range dynamic magnetic correlations, which disappear above $T_S$. The structural transition thus coincides with the onset of magnetic fluctuations rather than with static magnetic order. Our results indicate that short-range, dynamical magnetic correlations are sufficient to drive a static structural instability, providing a magnetically driven mechanism reminiscent of the iron-pnictide 122 family, yet realized here in a quasi-one-dimensional Mott system. These findings highlight the central role of magnetoelastic coupling in iron-based superconductors beyond the itinerant regime.

Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum phase transitions in a (1+1)-dimensional field theory composed of $N$ copies of the Ising conformal field theory interacting via competing relevant perturbations. The field theory governs the competition between a mass term and an interaction involving the product of $N$ order-parameter fields, which is realized, e.g. in coupled Ising chains, two-leg spin ladders, and SO($N$)-symmetric spin chains. By combining a perturbative renormalization group analysis and large-scale matrix-product state simulations, we systematically determine the nature of the phase transition as a function of $N$. For $N=2$ and $N=3$, we confirm that the transition is continuous, belonging to the Ising and four-state Potts universality classes, respectively. In contrast, for $N \ge 4$, our results provide compelling evidence that the transition becomes first order. We further apply these findings to specific lattice models with SO($N$) symmetry, including spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ two-leg ladders, that realize a direct transition between an SO($N$) symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase. Our results refine a recent conjecture regarding the criticality of transitions between SPT phases.

Abstract: We review the hallmarks of orbital loop currents in various correlated electron materials and how they have been evidenced using polarized neutron diffraction. Over the last 20 years, loop current signatures have been observed in high temperature copper oxide superconductors, iridates, copper oxides spin ladders and recently kagome vanadate superconductors. Such currents induce orbital magnetic moments within the unit cell of these quantum materials that can be detected through their interaction with the neutron spin. In addition to the usual description of orbital moments using point-like local magnetic moments, we here show an alternative description of the neutron magnetic cross-section involving the microscopic currents running between different atomic orbitals. We discuss the corresponding magnetic structure factors and the resulting quantitative differences between both approaches.

Abstract: Phenomenological rules play a central role in the design of chemical reactions and materials with targeted properties. Typically, these are formulated heuristically in terms of non-interacting orbitals and bands, yet show remarkable accuracy in predicting the complex behavior of intrinsically interacting many-body systems. While their non-interacting formulation makes them easy to interpret, it potentially hinders the development of new rules for systems governed by strong correlation, such as transition metal-based materials. In this work, we present a rigorous framework that allows bridging between fully interacting, even strongly correlated, systems and an effective one-body picture in terms of quasiparticles. Further, we present a computational strategy to efficiently and accurately access the main components of such a description: the embedding approximation of the ghost Gutzwiller Ansatz. We illustrate the capabilities of this quasiparticle formulation on the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, and apply their reformulated version to toy ``reactions'' which exemplify the main scenarios covered by them.

Abstract: We develop a hybrid Monte Carlo method to efficiently compute the physical observables from the samplings of the Laughlin and the Moore-Read wave functions of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems. With the advancements in methodology, including global updates and double stereographic projection on spherical geometry, our hybrid Monte Carlo simulation is significantly faster than the widely used Metropolis Monte Carlo scheme. As a result, we can readily simulate systems with electron numbers $N > 1000$ on both disk and sphere geometries. We apply this method to investigating the topological shift obtained from the edge dipole moment, computed from the density of the wave function on the disk. We also numerically computed the non-Abelian braiding matrices for different braiding schemes of the Moore-Read quasiholes on the sphere. Results with much better quality compared with previous works have been achieved. With the thermodynamic limit results obtained at ease, we also discuss the future usage of our method to clarify the questions on the instability of fractional quantum Hall states in an ideal Chern band setting or under quantum decoherence.

Abstract: The local equilibration time $τ_{\rm eq}$ of quantum many-body systems is conjectured to be bounded below by the Planckian time $\hbar /T$. We formalize this conjecture by defining $τ_{\rm eq}$ as the time scale at which a hydrodynamic description emerges for conserved densities. Drawing on analytic properties of real time thermal correlators, we establish a rigorous lower bound $τ_{\rm eq} \geq α\hbar /T$ on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in a `regulated' thermal two-point function. The dimensionless coefficient $α$ depends only on dimensionality and the type of hydrodynamic or diffusive behavior that emerges, and is independent of the thermalization mechanism or other microscopic details. This bound applies universally to local quantum many-body systems, with or without a quasiparticle description, including in the presence of inelastic scattering.

Abstract: Owing to the power-law anisotropy in the quasiparticle dispersion, yielding an enhanced density of states, the effects of long range Coulomb interaction get amplified in three-dimensional generalized Weyl semimetals, characterized by integer monopole charge $n>1$ of the underlying Weyl nodes. Using a Wilsonian renormalization group approach controlled by a large-$N$ expansion with $N$ as the number of Weyl fermion flavors and a gauge-consistent regularization fixed by the Ward-Takahashi identity, we uncover for $n\ge 2$ an extended interaction-dominated scaling regime with intrinsically anisotropic dynamic Coulomb screening, a finite fermionic anomalous dimension, and a power-law suppression of the quasiparticle residue, yielding an \emph{anisotropic} marginal non-Fermi liquid at intermediate energies. Ultimately, the effective fine structure constant flows to zero, albeit only logarithmically slowly, so the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology emerges as a broad crossover, controlled by a slowly running coupling. By contrast, for $n=1$ the system retains an isotropic marginal Weyl-liquid character. These predictions can be tested via scaling in thermodynamics (specific heat and compressibility), direction-dependent optical conductivity, and by anisotropic broadening of the single-particle spectral function in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.

Abstract: Lanthanum-based compounds are cornerstones of superconductivity research, yet the La-5d orbitals typically remain empty spectator states far above the Fermi level (EF). While superconductivity has been induced in LaO up to 5.37 K in tensile epitaxy films, the intrinsic ground state of the bulk phase has remained controversial mostly due to synthetic challenges, with early reports suggesting a metallic nature. Here we report the high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis of pure bulk rock-salt LaO and unveil its intrinsic type-II superconductivity with a transition temperature (TC) of ~6 K at ambient pressure. The bulk TC is further enhanced to 6.9 K in La1-xYxO at x = 0.10, where Y doping leads to lattice contraction (chemical pressing) and a remarkable increase in electron carrier concentration. Strikingly, applying physical pressure further enhances the TC to a maximum of 12.7 K at 20 GPa, the highest TC in lanthanum monochalcogenides LaX (X = S, Se, Te, and O) to date. This pressure dependence is diametrically opposed to the behavior observed in films, and occurs despite a pressure-induced reduction in the density of states at EF - a trend that sharply contradicts the conventional phonon-mediated BCS mechanism. Our first-principles calculations reveal that compressive strain modifies the crystal field splitting to enhance La-5d/O-2p hybridization, fostering a three-dimensional multi-pocket Fermi surface favorable for spin/orbital fluctuation-mediated pairing. This work clarifies the intrinsic superconductivity of bulk LaO and provides a foundation for designing new rare-earth-based superconductors with higher TC

Abstract: The spin-ladder compounds of the BaFe2X3 (X = chalcogen) family may be viewed as dimensional reductions (along stripe-like motifs) of the two-dimensional iron-based pnictide planes extensively studied since 2006. Remarkably, despite their reduced dimensionality, these materials retain the capacity for unconventional ground states, exemplified by the emergence of superconductivity in \bfse\ under applied pressure beyond 10 GPa, following a structural phase transition at 4 GPa. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation combining high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations, which together elucidate the true crystallographic nature of this pressure-induced superconducting phase. While X-ray diffraction alone reveals a symmetry lowering from the widely accepted orthorhombic Cmcm group to a monoclinic structure, it lacks sufficient sensitivity to resolve the precise space group. By integrating vibrational spectroscopy with density functional theory, we provide unambiguous evidence that the high-pressure phase is non-centrosymmetric, adopting the polar space group P2_1. These findings not only revise the structural assignment of \bfse\ in its superconducting state but also establish its non-centrosymmetric character (an essential ingredient for potential unconventional pairing mechanisms- thereby opening new perspectives on the interplay between lattice symmetry, dimensionality, and superconductivity in iron-based materials.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Superconducting waveguides are a promising platform for ultralow-loss transmission in the millimeter-wave to terahertz band under cryogenic conditions, with potential applications in astronomical instrumentation and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a framework, based on microscopic superconductivity theory, to evaluate the power-flow attenuation constant $α$ of superconducting rectangular waveguides in the $100~\mathrm{GHz}$--THz range, applicable to arbitrary electronic mean free paths $\ell$ from the dirty limit $\ell\llξ_0$ to the clean limit $\ell\ggξ_0$. We also derive an analytical expression for two-level-system (TLS)-induced attenuation $α_{\rm TLS}$ in thin native oxide layers within the standard TLS model. Using this framework, we perform numerical evaluations of $α$ for representative materials over standard waveguide sizes from WR15 to WR1. In the high-frequency regime $f \gtrsim 0.5 Δ/h$, low attenuation favors the clean regime $\ell\gtrsimξ_0$, indicating that high-purity materials can achieve very low attenuation below their gap frequency. For the TLS contribution, using parameter values representative of native Nb oxides, we find that $α_{\rm TLS}$ can become relevant at sufficiently low temperatures $T/T_c\lesssim 0.1$-0.2, where quasiparticle dissipation is exponentially suppressed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the strong-excitation regime using a recently developed nonlinear-response theory within the Keldysh--Usadel framework of nonequilibrium superconductivity and show that nonlinear dissipation produces a Higgs-mode peak in $α$ near $f\simeq Δ/h$ via a Kerr-type nonlinearity of the dissipative conductivity. This peak provides a distinct hallmark of the Higgs mode that has been largely overlooked so far.

Abstract: We study the orbital magnetic moment of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors with the semiclassical approach. We derive the orbital magnetic moment of a quasiparticle wavepacket by considering the energy correction of the wavepacket to the linear order of the magnetic field. The semiclassical result is further verified by a linear response calculation with a full quantum mechanical method. From the analytical expression we find that nontrivial structure in the superconducting pairing gap alone is unable to produce quasiparticle orbital magnetic moment, which is in sharp contrast to the behavior of quasiparticle Berry curvatures. We apply the formula to study a tight-binding model with chiral $d$-wave superconducting gap, and show the influence of orbital magnetic moment on the energy spectrum and local density of states. We also calculate the orbital Nernst effect driven by the interplay between the orbital magnetic moment and the Berry curvature of Bogoliubov quasiparticles.

Abstract: We perform a theoretical investigation of the nature of vortices in chiral $d+id$ superconductors on the kagome lattice. The study is motivated by recent experimental developments reporting evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting state of kagome metals. Using self-consistent microscopic calculations that incorporate the characteristics of the band structure of the kagome lattice, we find that fractional vortices permeate the ground state condensate in the presence of an external field. Each fractional vortex carries one third of the superconducting flux quantum and exhibits a characteristic signature related to one of the three sublattice degrees of freedom of the kagome lattice. We discuss the relevance of these results to recent experimental studies of kagome superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field.

Abstract: We study the parametric amplifier Hamiltonian within the framework of the Dunkl formalism. We introduce the Dunkl creation and annihilation operators and show that their quadratic combinations generate an $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra. The spectral problem is solved exactly using two algebraic methods: the $su(1,1)$ tilting transformation and the generalized Bogoliubov transformation. The exact energy spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions are obtained in terms of the Dunkl number coherent states. Furthermore, we compute the Mandel $Q$ parameter and the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ to analyze the statistical properties of the Dunkl squeezed states. We show that, for the squeezed vacuum, the Mandel parameter remains independent of the Dunkl deformation, whereas the correlation function exhibits an explicit dependence on the Dunkl parameter $μ$, which modifies the photon bunching effects. Finally, we show that our results reduce to the standard parametric amplifier case in the limit of vanishing Dunkl deformation parameter.

Abstract: Mapping finite-temperature dynamical phase diagrams of quantum many-body models is a necessary step towards establishing a framework of far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body universality. However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems. Finally, we propose a quantum simulation experiment on state-of-the-art digital quantum hardware to directly probe the predicted dynamical phases and their real-time formation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Many quantum phases, from topological orders to superfluids, are destabilized at finite temperature by the proliferation and motion of topological defects such as anyons or vortices. Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes. We propose an experimental setup for entropic toric code using dual species Rydberg arrays with dressing.

Abstract: We have reproducibly grown near-single-domain superconducting aluminum (Al) films on GaAs(111)A wafers using molecular beam epitaxy. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed twin-domain ratios of 0.00005 and 0.0003 for 19.4-nm- and 9.6-nm-thick films, respectively-the lowest reported for Al on any substrate and long considered unattainable for practical device platforms. Azimuthal scans across off-normal Al{$11\bar{1}$} reflections exhibit narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) values down to $0.55^\circ$, unmatched by epi-Al grown by any other method. Normal scans showed a well-defined (111) orientation with pronounced Pendellösung fringes, and $θ$-rocking-curve FWHM values down to $0.018^\circ$; the former indicates abrupt film-substrate and oxide-film interfaces. Electron backscatter diffraction mapping confirms macroscopic in-plane uniformity and the absence of $Σ$3 twin domains. Atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed atomically smooth surfaces and abrupt heterointerfaces. The films exhibit critical temperatures approaching bulk values, establishing a materials platform for scalable, high-coherence superconducting qubits.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique spectral properties, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, often influenced by boundary conditions. The modulation of these phenomena by generalized boundary conditions remains unexplored and not understood. Here, we analyze the Hatano-Nelson model with generalized boundary conditions induced by complex hopping amplitudes at the boundary. Using similarity transformations, we determine the conditions yielding real energy spectra and skin effect, and identify the emergence of exceptional points where spectra transition from real to complex. We demonstrate that tuning the boundary hopping amplitudes precisely controls the non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of eigenmodes at the lattice edges. These findings reveal the sensitivity of spectral and localization properties to boundary conditions, providing a framework for engineering quantum lattice models with tailored spectral and localization features, with potential applications in quantum devices.

Abstract: Equilibrium statistical ensembles impose stringent constraints on phases of quantum matter. For example, the Mermin-Wagner theorem prohibits long-range order in low-dimensional systems beyond the ground state. Here, we show that quantum circuits can learn states of matter with long-range order that are inaccessible in equilibrium. We construct variational quantum circuits that generate symmetry-broken and symmetry-protected topological states with long-range order in one-dimensional systems at finite energy density, where equilibrium states are typically featureless. Importantly, the learned states can exhibit unconventional features with enhanced metrological properties such as a quantum Fisher information close to a GHZ state, but robust against local measurements. Our work establishes coherent quantum dynamics as a powerful resource for engineering nonequilibrium phases of matter, opening a path toward a broader dynamical scope of quantum order beyond the constraints of equilibrium ensembles.

Abstract: Dissipation is commonly regarded as an obstacle to quantum control, as it induces decoherence and irreversibility. Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability. These results establish dissipation as a powerful tool for engineering dynamical phases, restoring quantum coherence, and controlling the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling.

Abstract: Moiré systems have emerged as an exciting tunable platform for engineering and probing quantum matter. A large number of exotic states have been observed, stimulating intense efforts in experiment, theory, and simulation. Utilizing a neural-network-based quantum Monte Carlo approach, we discover a new ground state of the two-dimensional electron gas in a honeycomb moire potential at a filling factor of $ν_m =1/4$ (one electron every four moiré minima). In this state, two opposite-spin electrons pair to form a singlet-like valence bond state which restores local $C_6$ symmetry in hexagonal molecules each spanning $6$ moiré minima. These molecules of pairs then form a molecular Wigner crystal, leaving one quarter of the moiré minima mostly depleted. The formation of such a paired Wigner crystal, absent any confining potential or attractive interaction to facilitate "pre-assembling" the molecule, provides a fascinating case of collective phenomena in strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, and opportunities to engineer exotic properties.

Abstract: Based on our experimental findings, we propose the following decision framework for practitioners. Quantum annealing is recommended when the problem formulation QUBO exhibits a high gradient variance (greater than 0.3) and the energy landscape contains numerous thin barriers characterized by sharp peaks and narrow valleys. Additionally, quantum approaches are particularly suitable when classical methods are observed to get trapped in local minima, the problem size is manageable given hardware constraints (less than 5000 variables for pure quantum annealing), and the time overhead of approximately 10 seconds is acceptable for the application.
  In contrast, classical methods are recommended when the gradient variance is low (less than 0.2), indicating smooth landscapes where quantum tunneling provides little advantage. Classical approaches are also preferable when the problem size is small and classical solvers can provide nearly instantaneous results, when solution quality requirements are modest and local optima suffice, or when hardware access or cost is a limiting factor.
  For problems that exceed pure quantum capacity but possess a favorable landscape structure, hybrid approaches combining quantum and classical techniques are recommended. Such hybrid methods are particularly effective when decomposition quality can be verified and both solution quality and scalability are important considerations.

Abstract: The classical Mpemba effect is the counterintuitive phenomenon where hotter water freezes faster than colder water due to the breakdown of Newton's law of cooling after a sudden temperature quench. The genuine nonequilibrium post-quench dynamics allows the system to evolve along effective shortcuts absent in the quasi-static regime. When the time needed for preparing the (classical or quantum) system in the hotter initial state is included, we encounter so-called Pontus-Mpemba effects. We here investigate multi-step Pontus-Mpemba protocols for open quantum systems whose dynamics is governed by time-inhomogeneous Lindblad master equations. In the limit of infinitely many steps, one arrives at continuous Pontus-Mpemba protocols. We study the crossover between the quasi-static and the sudden-quench regime, showing the presence of dynamically generated shortcuts achieved for time-dependent dissipation rates. Time-dependent rates can also cause non-Markovian behavior, highlighting the existence of rich dynamical regimes accessible beyond the Markovian framework.

Abstract: Accurate in situ calibration of microwave attenuation and amplification-chain noise is essential for superconducting quantum circuits. We demonstrate a compact, self-calibrating cryogenic noise source based on an on-chip chromium attenuator that can be resistively heated with nanowatt-level power and directly integrated into a coaxial microwave line at the mixing-chamber stage. By comparing Johnson-Nyquist noise generated by Joule and microwave heating, measured through the amplification chain, the attenuation of the input line, and hence the gain of the chain, is determined without requiring knowledge of the attenuator temperature. The device exhibits millisecond-scale response times and negligible heating of the cryostat base plate. Using this approach, we determine the gain and added noise of a cryogenic amplification chain over the 4-8 GHz band. Our results provide a simple and accurate method to characterize near-quantum-limited parametric amplifiers used in superconducting-qubit readout.

Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of a three-level ensemble under the Dicke limit, revealing a unified connection between superradiant emission and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Our results show that the transient superradiant burst exhibits the expected peak intensity scaling $I_{\max}\!\sim\! N^2$, with a universal finite-size correction $|ξ(N)-2|\!\sim\! 1/\ln N$ that governs the apparent scaling exponent in realistic ensembles. In the stationary regime, collective broadening modifies the EIT response: although it typically enhances absorption, it counterintuitively increases the group velocity, leading to a relative scaling $v_g\!\propto\! N^2$, even while $v_g\!\ll\! c$. This effect suggests that cooperative interactions fundamentally limit the achievable slow-light delay in dense media. To achieve these results, we derive a representative-atom master equation that quantitatively reproduces both the superradiant and EIT regimes, in excellent agreement with the exact symmetric-subspace dynamics and correctly incorporating collective feedback and $N$-dependent broadening. This unified framework bridges transient superradiant emission and steady-state quantum interference, with direct implications for slow light, quantum memories, and precision metrology.

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for simulating many-body systems in the NISQ era. Its effectiveness, however, depends on the faithful preparation of eigenstates, which becomes challenging in degenerate and strongly entangled regimes. We study this problem using the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with periodic boundary conditions in one, two, and three dimensions, considering systems of up to 27 qubits. We employ different ansatzes: the hardware-efficient EfficientSU2 from Qiskit, the physics-inspired Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) and HVA with symmetry breaking, and benchmark their performance using energy variance, entanglement entropy, spin correlations, and magnetization.

Abstract: Quantum computing improves substantially on known classical algorithms for various important problems, but the nature of the relationship between quantum and classical computing is not yet fully understood. This relationship can be clarified by free models, that add to classical computing just enough physical principles to represent quantum computing and no more. Here we develop an axiomatisation of quantum computing that replaces the standard continuous postulates with a small number of discrete equations, as well as a free model that replaces the standard linear-algebraic model with a category-theoretical one. The axioms and model are based on reversible classical computing, isolate quantum advantage in the ability to take certain well-behaved square roots, and link to various quantum computing hardware platforms. This approach allows combinatorial optimisation, including brute force computer search, to optimise quantum computations. The free model may be interpreted as a programming language for quantum computers, that has the same expressivity and computational universality as the standard model, but additionally allows automated verification and reasoning.

Abstract: In his late piece 'La nouvelle cuisine' (Bell 1990), John Bell describes the steps from an intuitive, informal principle of locality to a mathematical rule called Factorizability. This rule stipulates that when possible past causes are held fixed, the joint probabilities of outcomes of spacelike separated measurements, conditional on measurement settings, be the product of the local conditional probabilities individually. Bell shows that Factorizability conflicts with predictions of QM, predictions since confirmed in many experiments. However, Bell warns his readers that the steps leading to Factorizability should 'be viewed with the utmost suspicion'. He says that 'it is precisely in cleaning up intuitive ideas for mathematics that one is likely to throw the baby out with the bathwater' (1990, 239). Bell's suspicions were well-founded, for he himself misses an important baby. Here we retrieve and identify it: it is selection bias. We explain how failure of Factorizability may be regarded as a selection artefact, requiring no violation of locality in the intuitive, conceptual sense with which Bell begins his analysis. The argument begins with a central principle of causal discovery, Reichenbach's Principle of Common Cause (PCC). It is well known that correlations due to selection bias are not subject to PCC. Several writers have proposed that EPR-Bell correlations are also an exception to PCC, but it has not been noticed that they fall under this well-known exclusion. The point is relevant not only to the status of Bell nonlocality, but also for statistics and causal modeling. For these fields, the news is that selection effects play a ubiquitous role in quantum phenomena, in a form akin to collider bias.

Abstract: Harnessing dipolar spin environments as controllable quantum resources is a central challenge in solid-state quantum technologies. Here, we report the observation of a coherent mesoscopic spin state in a disordered ensemble of substitutional nitrogen (P1) centers in diamond. An iterative Hartmann-Hahn protocol transfers polarization from dense nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to a P1 ensemble, yielding a 740-fold enhancement over room-temperature thermal equilibrium as revealed by differential readout. The resulting mesoscopic P1 spin ensemble exhibits collective Rabi oscillations and long-lived spin-lock and Hahn-echo coherences. We identify a crossover in the saturation polarization arising from the competition between coherent driving and local disorder, providing a quantitative measure of the system's intrinsic disorder. These results establish a foundation for utilizing dark electron spin ensembles as robust resources for quantum sensing and quantum many-body simulation.

Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors have attracted considerable interest for integration into emerging quantum photonic networks. Strain engineering of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) enables the tuning of light-matter interactions and associated optoelectronic properties, and generates new functionalities, including the formation of quantum dots (QDs). Here, we combine spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence ($μ$-PL) spectroscopy from cryogenic (4$\text{-}$94 K) to room temperature with micro-Raman spectroscopy at room temperature to investigate the strain-dependent emission energies of thousands of individual QDs in ML-WS$_2$ and ML-WSe$_2$, integrated across multiple heterostructures and a piezoelectric device. Compared with delocalized excitons, QDs in both materials exhibit enhanced strain sensitivities of their emission energies $-$ approximately fourfold in WS$_2$ and twofold in WSe$_2$ $-$ leading to pronounced broadening of the ensemble emission linewidth. Temperature-dependent $μ$-PL spectroscopy combined with dynamic strain tuning experiments further reveal that the enhanced strain sensitivity of individual QDs originates from strengthened interactions with low-energy phonons induced by quantum confinement. Our results demonstrate a versatile strain-engineering approach with potential for spectral matching across solid-state, atomic, and hybrid quantum photonic networks, and provide new insights into phonon-QD interactions in two-dimensional semiconductors.

Abstract: Quantum communication holds the potential to revolutionize information transmission by enabling secure data exchange that exceeds the limits of classical systems. One of the key performance metrics in quantum information theory, namely the Holevo bound, quantifies the amount of classical information that can be transmitted reliably over a quantum channel. However, computing and optimizing the Holevo bound remains a challenging task due to its dependence on both the quantum input ensemble and the quantum channel. In order to maximize the Holevo bound, we propose a unified projected gradient ascent algorithm to optimize the quantum channel given a fixed input ensemble. We provide a detailed complexity analysis for the proposed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quantum channel optimization yields higher Holevo bounds than input ensemble optimization.

Abstract: We investigate autonomous dissipative charging mechanisms for lattice quantum batteries within the framework of open quantum systems. Focusing on engineered Markovian dissipation, we show that appropriately designed Lindblad jump operators can drive tight-binding systems into highly excited band-edge states, resulting in steady states with large ergotropy. We illustrate this mechanism in a one-dimensional tight-binding chain and in a two-dimensional graphene lattice. We find that disorder enhances the charging power, indicating that dissipation-assisted localization effects can be beneficial for energy storage. Moreover, the dissipative charging process remains robust against additional local dephasing noise. Our results establish bond dissipation as an effective and physically transparent mechanism for charging lattice quantum batteries in realistic open-system settings.

Abstract: We explore the operation of quantum batteries in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, when they are charged either through a sudden quench in the magnetic field strength or by coupling them to a bosonic oscillator bath. Through initializing the battery in either the symmetric or broken symmetry phases of the LMG model we analyze how the different spectral properties can affect the performance of both the charging and discharging of the battery. In particular, we show that by quenching the magnetic field strength from the symmetric phase to the broken phase, we can achieve a significant enhancement in stored energy, as well as stable and efficient ergotropy extraction. Similar observations can be made when introducing weak coupling between the battery with the bosonic bath, while the amount of stored work and ergotropy saturate at strong coupling. These findings emphasize the importance of the magnetic field dynamics and environmental coupling in optimizing charging performance, which could lead to practical applications in quantum energy storage.

Abstract: We present an AI-assisted framework for predicting individual runs of complex quantum experiments, including contextuality and causality (adaptive measurements), within our long-term programme of discovering a local hidden-variable theory that extends quantum theory. In order to circumvent impossibility theorems, we replace the assumption of free choice (measurement independence and parameter independence) with a weaker, compatibilistic version called contingent free choice.
  Our framework is based on interpreting complex quantum experiments as a Chess-like game between observers and the universe, which is seen as an economic agent minimizing action. The game structures corresponding to generic experiments such as fixed-causal-order process matrices or causal contextuality scenarios, together with a deterministic non-Nashian resolution algorithm that abandons unilateral deviation assumptions (free choice) and assumes Perfect Prediction instead, were described in previous work.
  In this new research, we learn the reward functions of the game, which contain a hidden variable, using neural networks. The cost function is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the frequency histograms obtained through many deterministic runs of the game and the predictions of the extended Born rule.
  Using our framework on the specific case of the EPR 2-2-2 experiment acts as a proof-of-concept and a toy local-realist hidden-variable model that non-Nashian quantum theory is a promising avenue towards a local hidden-variable theory. Our framework constitutes a solid foundation, which can be further expanded in order to fully discover a complete quantum theory.

Abstract: An industrial-scale adoption of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) requires the development of practical, stable, resilient and cost-effective hardware that can be manufactured at large scales. In this work we present a high-speed (1.25GHz), field-deployable QKD prototype based on integrated photonics, that is consolidated into standard 19-inch rack compatible units. Through integrated photonics, the system prioritizes autonomous long-term stability in metropolitan settings. The architecture is further simplified by removing the need for chromatic dispersion compensation over metropolitan distances (below 100km). We demonstrate continuous key exchange over more than 4 km of metropolitan optical fiber, where the prototype maintained stable, uninterrupted operation across a measurement spanning more than 12 day-night cycles without manual intervention.

Abstract: Quantum generative modeling, where the Born rule naturally defines probability distributions through measurement of parameterized quantum states, is a promising near-term application of quantum computing. We propose a Quantum Scrambling Born Machine in which a fixed entangling unitary -- acting as a scrambling reservoir -- provides multi-qubit entanglement, while only single-qubit rotations are optimized. We consider three entangling unitaries -- a Haar random unitary and two physically realizable approximations, a finite-depth brickwork random circuit and analog time evolution under nearest-neighbor spin-chain Hamiltonians -- and show that, for the benchmark distributions and system sizes considered, once the entangler produces near-Haar-typical entanglement the model learns the target distribution with weak sensitivity to the scrambler's microscopic origin. Finally, promoting the Hamiltonian couplings to trainable parameters casts the generative task as a variational Hamiltonian problem, with performance competitive with representative classical generative models at matched parameter count.

Abstract: Neural post-processing has been proposed as a lightweight route to enhance variational quantum eigensolvers by learning how to reweight measurement outcomes. In this work, we identify three general desiderata for such data-driven neural post-processing -- (i) self-contained training without prior knowledge, (ii) polynomial resources, and (iii) variational consistency -- and show that current approaches, such as diagonal non-unitary post-processing (DNP), cannot satisfy these requirements simultaneously. The obstruction is intrinsic: with finite sampling, normalization becomes a statistical bottleneck, and support mismatch between numerator and denominator estimators can render the empirical objective ill-conditioned and even sub-variational. Moreover, to reproduce the ground state with constant-depth ansatzes or with linear-depth circuits forming unitary 2-designs, the required reweighting range (and hence the sampling cost) grows exponentially with the number of qubits. Motivated by this no-go result, we develop a normalization-free alternative, the unitary variational quantum-neural hybrid eigensolver (U-VQNHE). U-VQNHE retains the practical appeal of a learnable diagonal post-processing layer while guaranteeing variational safety, and numerical experiments on transverse-field Ising models demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness over both VQE and DNP-based variants.

Abstract: Quantum teleportation between polarized single-photon and phase-opposite coherent states is studied using a hybrid entangled resource and entangled coherent states. The polarized single-photon qubit represents a discrete-variable (DV) quantum system, whereas the phase-opposite coherent-state qubit constitutes a continuous-variable (CV) system. While teleportation from CV to DV can be achieved with near-unit success probability, the reverse process is usually limited to a maximum success probability of $1/2$. We demonstrate that, by employing cross-Kerr nonlinearity together with passive linear optical components such as polarizing beam splitters, beam splitters, and phase shifters, almost perfect teleportation from DV to CV encodings can also be achieved.

Abstract: The characterization of collective behavior and nonequilibrium phase transitions in quantum systems is typically rooted in the analysis of suitable system observables, so-called order parameters. These observables might not be known a priori, but they may in principle be identified through analyzing the quantum state of the system. Experimentally, this can be particularly demanding as estimating quantum states and expectation values of quantum observables requires a large number of projective measurements. However, open quantum systems can be probed in situ by monitoring their output, e.g. via heterodyne-detection or photon-counting experiments, which provide space-time resolved information about their dynamics. Building on this, we present a machine-learning approach to detect nonequilibrium phase transitions from the measurement time-records of continuously-monitored quantum systems. We benchmark our method using the quantum contact process, a model featuring an absorbing-state phase transition, which constitutes a particularly challenging test case for the quantum simulation of nonequilibrium processes.

Abstract: Estimating the quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a crucial yet challenging task with widespread applications across quantum science and technologies. The recently proposed Krylov shadow tomography (KST) opens a new avenue for this task by introducing a series of Krylov bounds on the QFI. In this work, we address the practical applicability of the KST, unveiling that the Krylov bounds of low orders already enable efficient and accurate estimation of the QFI. We show that the Krylov bounds converge to the QFI exponentially fast with increasing order and can surpass the state-of-the-art polynomial lower bounds known to date. Moreover, we show that certain low-order Krylov bound can already match the QFI exactly for low-rank states prevalent in practical settings. Such exact match is beyond the reach of polynomial lower bounds proposed previously. These theoretical findings, solidified by extensive numerical simulations, demonstrate practical advantages over existing polynomial approaches, holding promise for fully unlocking the effectiveness of QFI-based applications.

Abstract: When increasing the dimensionality of quantum systems, high-dimensional quantum state certification becomes important in quantum information science and technology. However, how to certify ensembles of high-dimensional quantum states in a black-box scenario remains a challenging task. In this work, we report an experimental test of certifying ensembles of high-dimensional quantum states based on prepare-and-measure experiments with \textit{independent devices}, where the state preparation device and the measurement device have no shared randomness. In our experiment, the prepared quantum states are high-dimensional orbital angular momentum states of single photons, and both the preparation fidelity and the measurement fidelity are about 99.0$\%$ for the six-dimensional quantum states. We also measure the crosstalk matrices and calculate the similarity parameter for up to ten dimensions. We not only experimentally certify the ensemble of high-dimensional quantum states in a semi-device-independent manner, but also experimentally investigate the effect of atmospheric turbulent noise on high-dimensional quantum state certification. Our experimental results clearly show that the certification of high-dimensional quantum states can still be achieved even under the influence of atmospheric turbulent noise. Our findings have potential implications in quantum certification and quantum random number generation.

Abstract: The development of single-photon sources has been nothing but rapid in recent years, with quantum emitter-based systems showing especially impressive progress. In this article, we give an overview of the developments in single-photon sources based on single molecules. We will introduce polycyclic hydrocarbons as the most commonly used emitter systems for the realization of an organic solid-state single-photon source. At cryogenic temperatures this special class of fluorescent molecules demonstrates remarkable optical properties such as negligible dephasing, indefinite photostability, and high photon rates, which make them attractive as fundamental building blocks in emerging quantum technologies. To better understand the general properties and limitations of these molecules, we discuss sample preparation, light collection strategies and relevant emitter parameters such as absorption and emission spectra, lifetime, and dephasing. We will also give an overview of light extraction strategies as a crucial part of a single-photon source. Finally, we conclude with a look into the future, displaying current challenges and possible solutions.

Abstract: Quantum information decoupling is a fundamental primitive in quantum information theory, underlying various applications in quantum physics. We prove a novel one-shot decoupling theorem formulated in terms of quantum relative entropy distance, with the decoupling error bounded by two sandwiched Rényi conditional entropies. In the asymptotic i.i.d. setting of standard information decoupling via partial trace, we show that this bound is ensemble-tight in quantum relative entropy distance and thereby yields a characterization of the associated decoupling error exponent in the low-cost-rate regime.
  Leveraging this framework, we derive several operational applications formulated in terms of purified distance: (i) a single-letter expression for the exact error exponent of quantum state merging in terms of Petz-Rényi conditional entropies, and (ii) regularized expressions for the achievable error exponent of entanglement distillation and quantum channel coding in terms of Petz-Rényi coherent informations. We further prove that these achievable bounds are tight for maximally correlated states and generalized dephasing channels, respectively, for the high distillation-rate/coding-rate regimes.

Abstract: Preparing high-fidelity logical states is a central challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing, yet existing approaches struggle to balance control complexity against resource overhead. Here, we present a complete framework for the fault-tolerant preparation of arbitrary logical states encoded in the four-legged cat code. This framework is engineered to suppress the dominant incoherent errors, including excitation decay and dephasing in both the bosonic mode and the ancilla via error detection. Numerical simulations with experimentally realistic parameters on a 3D superconducting cavity platform yield logical infidelities on the order of $10^{-4}$. A scaling analysis confirms that the logical error rate grows nearly quadratically with the physical error rate, confirming that all first-order errors are fully suppressed. Our protocol is compatible with current hardware and is scalable to multiple bosonic modes, providing a resource-efficient foundation for magic state preparation and higher-level concatenated quantum error correction.

Abstract: We study a continuum Hatano--Nelson model with a saturating nonlinear nonreciprocity and analyze its stationary states via the associated phase-space flow. We uncover a global scenario controlled by a subcritical Hopf bifurcation and a saddle-node of limit cycles, which together generate a finite coexistence window. In this window, skin modes and extended states are both stable at a fixed energy $E$, separated by a nonlinear basin separatrix in phase space rather than a spectral (mobility-edge) mechanism in a linear system. An averaged amplitude equation yields closed-form predictions for the limit-cycle branches and the SNLC threshold. Building on the basin geometry, we introduce a basin-fraction order parameter that exhibits a first-order-like jump at SNLC. Intriguing physical phenomena in the coexistence window are also revealed, such as separatrix-induced long-lived spatial transients and hysteresis. Overall, our findings highlight that, beyond linear spectral concepts, global attractor-basin geometry provides a powerful and complementary lens for understanding stationary states in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems.

Abstract: Feedback-driven quantum reservoir computing has so far been studied primarily in gate-based architectures, motivating alternative scalable, hardware-friendly physical platforms. Here we investigate a linear-optical quantum reservoir architecture for time-series processing based on multiphoton interference in a reconfigurable interferometer network equipped with threshold detectors and measurement-conditioned feedback. The reservoir state is constructed from coarse-grained coincidence features, and the feedback updates only a structured, budgeted subset of programmable phases, enabling recurrence without training internal weights. By sweeping the feedback strength, we identify three dynamical regimes and find that memory performance peaks near the stability boundary. We quantify temporal processing via linear memory capacity and validate nonlinear forecasting on benchmarks, namely Mackey-Glass series, NARMA$-n$ and non-integrable Ising dynamics. The proposed architecture is compatible with current photonic technology and lowers the experimental barrier to feedback-driven QRC for time-series analysis with competitive accuracy.

Abstract: This paper investigates the motion of a single photon in a two-dimensional plane under closed and open boundary conditions. We employ two methods to construct the Hilbert space: Method A, based on the standard second-quantization formalism, and Method B, based on a non-standard approach. By eliminating redundant quantum states, we obtain a reduced Hilbert space with significantly lower dimensionality, thereby improving the efficiency of numerical simulations. In a closed system, the two methods are equivalent, and their unitary evolution results are identical. The probability distribution diffuses outward from the center and exhibits a significant rebound after reaching the boundary. In an open system, Method B, by incorporating more dissipation channels, provides a more accurate description of the photon escape process at the boundary. The probability curves obtained from the two methods completely overlap before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, a slight difference appears, but this difference does not amplify with evolution and tends to converge in the later stage. Method B yields a slightly higher dissipative-state probability, indicating that the photon escapes faster. Visualization of the two-dimensional probability distribution shows that the three scenarios (closed system, open system with Method A, and open system with Method B) exhibit identical probability distributions before reaching the boundary. After the boundary is reached, the open systems exhibit significant probability loss, which increases rapidly with evolution. The probability distribution patterns of the two open systems are highly similar, exhibiting synchronized evolution.

Abstract: Superposition is the core feature that sets quantum theory apart from classical physics. Here, we investigate whether sets of quantum measurements can be modelled by using only devices that are operationally classical, in the sense that they have no superposition properties. This leads us to propose classical measurement models, which we show to be stronger than commutative measurements but weaker than joint measurability. We determine both the exact depolarisation noise rate and the measurement loss rate at which the all projective measurements in $d$-dimensional quantum theory admit a classical model. For finite sets of quantum measurements we develop methods both for constructing classical models and for falsifying the existence of such model via prepare-and-measure setups. Furthermore, we show that this concept also has operational implications. For that, we consider whether quantum measurements with classical side-information can be implemented in sequence without causing a disturbance and we show that classical models imply an affirmative answer. Our work sheds light on superposition as a resource for quantum measurement devices.

Abstract: Quantum optimization has gained increasing attention as advances in quantum hardware enable the exploration of problem instances approaching real-world scale. Among existing approaches, variational quantum algorithms and quantum annealing dominate current research; however, both typically rely on one-hot encodings that severely limit scalability. Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) was recently introduced as an alternative paradigm that reduces qubit requirements by embedding problem variables into Pauli correlations. Despite its promise, PCE has not yet been studied in the context of constrained optimization. In this work, we extend the PCE framework to constrained combinatorial optimization problems and evaluate its performance across multiple problem sizes. Our results show that the standard PCE formulation struggles to reliably enforce constraints, which motivates the introduction of the Iterative-$α$ PCE. This iterative strategy significantly improves solution quality, achieving consistent constraint satisfaction while yielding better cut sizes across a wide range of instances. These findings highlight both the limitations of current PCE formulations for constrained problems and the effectiveness of iterative strategies for advancing quantum optimization in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Quantum phase transition is interpreted as an evolution, at the end of which a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian $H(g)$ loses its observability. In the language of mathematics, such a quantum catastrophe occurs at an exceptional point of order $N$ (EPN). Although the Hamiltonian $H(g)$ itself becomes unphysical in the limit of $g \to g^{EPN}$, it is shown that it can play the role of an unperturbed operator in a perturbation-approximation analysis of the vicinity of the EPN singularity. Such an analysis is elementary at $N\leq 3$ and numerical at $N\geq 5$, so we pick up $N=4$. We demonstrate that the specific EP4 degeneracy becomes accessible via a unitary evolution process realizable inside a parametric domain ${\cal D}_{\rm physical}$, the boundaries of which are determined non-numerically. Possible relevance of such a mathematical result in the context of non-Hermitian photonics is emphasized.

Abstract: We analyze the modification of entanglement dynamics in the Grover algorithm when the qubits are subjected to single-qubit amplitude-damping or phase-flip noise. We compare quantum trajectories with full density-matrix simulations, analyzing the dynamics of averaged trajectory entanglement (TE) and operator entanglement (OE), in the respective state representation. Although not a genuine entanglement measure, both TE and OE are connected to the efficiency of matrix product state simulations and thus of fundamental interest. As in many quantum algorithms, at the end of the Grover circuit entanglement decreases as the system converges towards the target product state. While we find that this is well captured in the OE dynamics, quantum trajectories rarely follow paths of reducing entanglement. Optimized unraveling schemes can lower TE slightly, however we show that deep in the circuit OE is generally smaller than TE. This implies that matrix product density operator (MPDO) simulations of quantum circuits can in general be more efficient than quantum trajectories. In addition, we investigate the noise-rate scaling of success probabilities for both amplitude-damping and phase-flip noise in Grover's algorithm.

Abstract: We consider rectilinear free-space propagation of electromagnetic wavepackets using electromagnetic field theory, scalar wavepacket propagation, and quantum-mechanical formalism. We demonstrate that spatially localized wavepackets are inherently characterized by a subluminal group velocity and a superluminal phase velocity, whose product equals $c^2$. These velocities are also known as the 'energy' and 'momentum' velocities, introduced by K. Milton and J. Schwinger. We illustrate general conclusions by explicit calculations for Gaussian beams and wavepackets, and also highlight subtleties of the quantum-mechanical description based on the 'photon wavefunction'.

Abstract: The simple harmonic oscillator has a well-known normalizable, positive energy, bound state spectrum. We show that degenerate with each such positive energy eigenvalue there is a non-normalizable positive energy eigenstate whose eigenfunction is orthogonal to that of the standard energy eigenfunction. This class of states is not built on the vacuum that $a$ annihilates, but is instead built on the vacuum that $a^{\dagger} a$ annihilates. These non-normalizable but nonetheless stationary energy eigenstates are accompanied by yet another set of non-normalizable states, states whose wave functions however are not stationary but instead grow linearly in time. With these states not being energy eigenstates, the eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian is incomplete; with the full Hilbert space containing states that are not energy eigenstates. Thus each energy eigenvalue of the harmonic oscillator is an exceptional point at which the Hamiltonian becomes of non-diagonalizable, and thus manifestly non-Hermitian, Jordan-block form. Such non-Hermitian structures occur for Hamiltonians that have an antilinear $PT$ symmetry. As is characteristic of such systems, one can construct a probability conserving inner product that despite the linear in time growth is nonetheless time independent, and not only that, it leads to states with zero norm. In addition, as is again characteristic of $PT$ symmetry, these non-normalizable states can be made normalizable by a continuation into a so-called Stokes wedge domain in the complex plane. In this domain one has a completely consistent quantum theory, one that lives alongside the standard normalizable energy eigenspectrum sector. This thus not quite so simple harmonic oscillator provides an explicit realization of our general contention that antilinearity is more basic to quantum theory than Hermiticity.

Abstract: Modern precision experiments often probe unknown classical fields with bosonic sensors in quantum-noise-limited regimes where vacuum fluctuations limit conventional readout. We introduce Quantum Signal Learning (QSL), a sensing framework that extends metrology to a broader property-learning setting, and propose a quantum-enhanced protocol that simultaneously estimates many properties of a classical signal with shot noise suppressed below the vacuum level. Our scheme requires only two-mode squeezing, passive optics, and static homodyne measurements, and enables post-hoc classical estimation of many properties from the same experimental dataset. We prove that our protocol enables a quantum speedup for common classical sensing tasks, including measuring electromagnetic correlations, real-time feedback control of interferometric cavities, and Fourier-domain matched filtering. To establish these separations, we introduce an optimal-transport conditioning method, and show both worst-case exponential separations from all entanglement-free strategies and practical speedups over homodyne and heterodyne baselines. We further show that when squeezing is treated as a resource, a protocol with squeezed light can sense a structured classical background exponentially faster than any coherent classical probe.

Abstract: Stabilizer states hold a special place in quantum information science due to their connection with quantum error correction and quantum circuit simulation. In the context of classical simulations of many-body physics, they are an example of states that can be both highly entangled and efficiently represented and transformed under Clifford operators. Recently, Clifford operators have been discussed in the context of fermionic quantum computation through their extension, the Majorana Clifford group. Here, we document the phase-sensitive form of the corresponding Majorana stabilizer states, as well as the algorithms for computing their amplitudes, their inner products, and update rules for transforming Majorana stabilizer states under Majorana Clifford gates.

Abstract: We study an adiabatic variant of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) in which VQE is performed iteratively for a sequence of Hamiltonians along an adiabatic path. We derive the conditions under which gradient-based optimization successfully prepares the adiabatic ground states. These conditions show that the barren plateau problem and local optima can be avoided. Additionally, we propose using energy-standard-deviation measurements at runtime to certify eigenstate accuracy and verify convergence to the global optimum.

Abstract: While ground-state preparation is expected to be a primary application of quantum computers, it is also an essential subroutine for many fault-tolerant algorithms. In early fault-tolerant regimes, logical measurements remain costly, motivating adaptive, shot-frugal state-preparation strategies that efficiently utilize each measurement. We introduce the Shadow Enhanced Greedy Quantum Eigensolver (SEGQE) as a greedy, shadow-assisted framework for measurement-efficient ground-state preparation. SEGQE uses classical shadows to evaluate, in parallel and entirely in classical post-processing, the energy reduction induced by large collections of local candidate gates, greedily selecting at each step the gate with the largest estimated energy decrease. We derive rigorous worst-case per-iteration sample-complexity bounds for SEGQE, exhibiting logarithmic dependence on the number of candidate gates. Numerical benchmarks on finite transverse-field Ising models and ensembles of random local Hamiltonians demonstrate convergence in a number of iterations that scales approximately linearly with system size, while maintaining high-fidelity ground-state approximations and competitive energy estimates. Together, our empirical scaling laws and rigorous per-iteration guarantees establish SEGQE as a measurement-efficient state-preparation primitive well suited to early fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures.

Abstract: The theory of open quantum systems served as a tool to prepare entanglement at the beginning stage of quantum technology and more recently provides an important tool for state preparation. Dynamics given by time dependent Lindbladians are Markovian and lead to decoherence, decay of correlation and convergence to equilibrium. In contrast Non-Markovian evolutions can outperform their Markovian counterparts by enhancing memory. In this letter we compare the trajectories of Markovian and Non-Markovian evolutions starting from a fixed initial value. It turns out that under mild assumptions every trajectory can be obtained from a family of time dependent Lindbladians. Hence Non-Markovianity is invisible if single trajectories are concerned.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of pseudo-deterministic quantum algorithms. These are quantum algorithms that, for any input, output a canonical solution with high probability. Focusing on the query complexity model, our main contributions include the following complexity separations, which require new lower bound techniques specifically tailored to pseudo-determinism:
  - We exhibit a problem, Avoid One Encrypted String (AOES), whose classical randomized query complexity is $O(1)$ but is maximally hard for pseudo-deterministic quantum algorithms ($Ω(N)$ query complexity).
  - We exhibit a problem, Quantum-Locked Estimation (QL-Estimation), for which pseudo-deterministic quantum algorithms admit an exponential speed-up over classical pseudo-deterministic algorithms ($O(\log(N))$ vs. $Θ(\sqrt{N})$), while the randomized query complexity is $O(1)$.
  Complementing these separations, we show that for any total problem $R$, pseudo-deterministic quantum algorithms admit at most a quintic advantage over deterministic algorithms, i.e., $D(R) = \tilde O(psQ(R)^5)$.
  On the algorithmic side, we identify a class of quantum search problems that can be made pseudo-deterministic with small overhead, including Grover search, element distinctness, triangle finding, $k$-sum, and graph collision.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Simultaneously estimating multiple parameters at the ultimate limit is a central challenge in quantum metrology, often hindered by inherent incompatibilities in optimal estimation strategies. At its most extreme, this incompatibility culminates in a fundamental impossibility when the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) becomes singular, rendering joint estimation unattainable. This is the case for a canonical problem: estimating the amplitude and frequency of an AC magnetic field, where the generators are parallel to each other. Here, we introduce a quantum control protocol that resolves this singularity. Our control protocol strategically engineers the sensor's time evolution so the generators for the two parameters become orthogonal. It not only removes the singularity but also restores the optimal scaling of precision with interrogation time for both parameters simultaneously. We experimentally validate this protocol using a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond at room temperature, demonstrating the concurrent achievement of the optimal scaling for both parameters under realistic conditions.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of light interacting with a near-resonant atomic medium using the truncated Wigner and positive P phase-space representations. The atomic degrees of freedom are described using the Jordan-Schwinger mapping. The dynamics is first analyzed under unitary evolution and subsequently in the presence of an optical reservoir. While both approaches capture the main features of the light-matter dynamics, we find that the truncated Wigner approximation exhibits noticeable deviations for stronger interaction strengths and when reservoir-induced noise becomes significant.
