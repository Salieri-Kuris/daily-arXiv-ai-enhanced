### [1] [Josephson scanning tunneling spectroscopy in superconducting phases coexisting with pair-, charge- and spin-density-waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02191)
*Alyson Laskowski,Jasmin Bedow,Dirk K. Morr*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: Spatial oscillations in superconductors align with density-wave phases, imaged via Josephson current, showing distinct phase shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if observed spatial oscillations in various superconductors are consistent with pair-, charge-, or spin-density-wave phases.

Method: Josephson scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments to measure critical Josephson current and analyze spatial oscillations.

Result: Spatial oscillations of superconducting order parameter and density waves show distinct phase shifts (Δφ=0 or π for charge-density wave, Δφ=π/2 for spin-density wave).

Conclusion: The spatial oscillations of the superconducting order parameter and density waves can be imaged via critical Josephson current measurements, revealing phase shifts that distinguish charge- and spin-density waves.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the recent observations of spatial oscillations in the energy position of the superconducting coherence peaks in the cuprate, transition metal dichalcogenide, iron-based and heavy-fermion superconductors are consistent with the possible presence of a pair-, charge- or spin-density-wave phase. We show that for all three cases, the spatial oscillations of the superconducting order parameter, $Δ({\bf r})$ can be imaged via the critical Josephson current, $I_c({\bf r})$ measured in Josephson scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments. Finally, we show that the spatial oscillations of the density waves and of $Δ({\bf r})$ exhibit relative phase shifts of $Δφ= 0$ or $π$ for a charge-density wave, and $Δφ=π/2$ for the spin-density wave.

*Jung-Shen Kao*

TL;DR: A method combining differentiable TDGL and SBI with NRE accurately infers interband Josephson coupling from vortex patterns in Type-1.5 superconductors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inferring microscopic couplings in multi-component superconductors from vortex configurations is challenging due to complex, glassy vortex patterns and high metastability in Type-1.5 systems.

Method: Combines a differentiable Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) solver with Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), using Neural Ratio Estimation (NRE) to approximate the likelihood-to-evidence ratio for Bayesian inference of the interband Josephson coupling.

Result: The method effectively quantifies the intractability of the problem through the Hessian spectrum analysis and overcomes it by leveraging SBI and NRE for accurate parameter recovery.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully recovers the interband Josephson coupling from vortex density fields with calibrated uncertainty, demonstrating its reliability on synthetic data.

Abstract: Inferring microscopic couplings in multi-component superconductors directly from vortex configurations is a challenging inverse problem. In Type-1.5 systems, Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) dynamics generate complex, glassy vortex patterns with high metastability. We explicitly quantify this intractability by analyzing the Hessian spectrum of the energy landscape, revealing a proliferation of soft modes that hinders traditional sampling. We address this challenge by combining a differentiable TDGL solver with Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). Our approach treats the solver as a stochastic forward model mapping physical parameters (θ = (η, B, ν)) to vortex density fields. Using Neural Ratio Estimation (NRE), we train a classifier to approximate the likelihood-to-evidence ratio and perform Bayesian inference for the interband Josephson coupling from vortex density fields. On synthetic data, the proposed method reliably recovers the coupling with calibrated uncertainty.

### [3] [Translational symmetry breaking in the electronic nematic phase of BaFe2As2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02488)
*K. Koshiishi,L. Liu,K. Okazaki,H. Suzuki,J. Xu,M. Horio,H. Kumigashira,K. Ono,M. Nakajima,S. Ishida,K. Kihou,C. H. Lee,A. Iyo,H. Eisaki,S. Uchida,A. Fujimori*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: The study shows that the nematic phase in BaFe2As2 exhibits an antiferroic order similar to the AFO phase, likely due to an antiferro-orbital order involving the d_xy orbital.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the controversial relationship between nematicity, stripe-type spin-density-wave order, and orthorhombic lattice distortion in iron-based superconductors.

Method: Temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) was used to study the electronic structure of BaFe2As2 across the AFO, nematic, and paramagnetic phases.

Result: The Dirac cone feature observed in the AFO phase persists in the nematic phase, indicating a similar antiferroic order. This supports the idea of an antiferro-orbital order involving the d_xy orbital.

Conclusion: The persistence of the Dirac cone feature in the nematic phase suggests that an antiferroic order with the same periodicity as the AFO phase exists, likely driven by an antiferro-orbital order involving the d_xy and other orbitals.

Abstract: The microscopic origin of the nematicity, namely, four-fold rotational symmetry breaking in iron-based superconductors has been controversial since its discovery. In particular, its relationship with the stripe-type spin-density-wave order and the orthorhombic lattice distortion in the antiferromagnetic orthorhombic (AFO) phase, which exists at temperatures below the electronic nematic phase, has been highly debated. Here, we report on the temperature evolution of angle-resolved photoemission spectra of the parent compound BaFe2As2, ranging from the AFO to nematic to paramagnetic phases. The Dirac cone feature, which is formed in the AFO phase, is found to persist in the nematic phase, suggesting that an antiferroic order of the same periodicity as the AFO phase persists in the nematic phase. Considering the relatively shallow d_xy orbital in BaFe2As2, we propose that an antiferro-orbital order involving the d_xy and other orbitals takes place in the nematic phase.

Abstract: Nonreciprocal dissipationless transport has long been sought for applications in superconducting technologies. Recently, it has been implemented by the so called superconducting diode effect. Such effect arises from an imbalance in critical supercurrents flowing in opposite directions. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate how the superconducting diode effect emerges in the quantum spin Hall phase when brought into full proximity with a superconductor. We explore two regimes: large and narrow quantum wells. In the former geometry, we show that the superconducting diode effect can be externally controlled using both magnetic and electric fields, achieving unit efficiency. In the latter regime, where tunneling between opposite edges may occur, we propose a mechanism for an intrinsic superconducting diode effect driven by edge reconstruction, which does not require external magnetic fields.

### [5] [Higgs physics in superconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02637)
*Hao Chu,Haotian Zhang,Zhili Zhang*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: The paper explores the Higgs mode in superconductors, linking it to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism and reviewing recent advances in spectroscopic detection, with implications for future research in high-Tc superconductivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation of the paper is to provide a deeper understanding of superconductivity by exploring the Higgs mode, drawing parallels between superconductors and particle physics, and leveraging recent advancements in ultrafast spectroscopic techniques.

Method: The paper reviews the conceptual similarities between the Anderson-Higgs mechanism in superconductors and particle physics, particularly focusing on the role of the Higgs mode. It also discusses the use of nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy as an effective approach to study the Higgs mode.

Result: The paper summarizes the historical development and conceptual foundations of the Higgs mode in superconductors, emphasizing recent progress in its spectroscopic detection through nonlinear terahertz techniques.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting the significance of the Higgs mode in understanding superconductivity and its potential implications for future research in high-Tc superconductivity and correlated materials.

Abstract: As pointed out by Nambu-Goldstone, continuous symmetry breaking gives rise to gapless bosonic excitation. In superconductors, continuous local U(1) gauge symmetry is broken. The gapless excitation thus created is the collective phase mode of a superconductor. In 1962, Anderson pointed out that Coulomb interaction lifts this gapless mode to the superconducting plasma frequency. Therefore, in a superconducting fluid there are no bosonic excitations below the Cooper pair binding energy. Anderson mechanism also implies that the massless photon becomes massive in a superconductor. It provides a microscopic theory for dissipationless charge transport (with Landau criterion for superfluidity) and the Meissner effect in a superconductor. Jumping to particle physics, to explain why the gauge bosons for electroweak interaction are massive, Higgs, Englert, Kibble et al. proposed the existence of the Higgs field. This matter field couples to the massless W, Z bosons and generates mass via the Higgs mechanism. Due to their conceptual similarities, these two mechanisms are referred to as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. In 2013, the detection of the Higgs boson provided the final proof for the Higgs hypothesis decades after its conception. The amplitude mode of a superconductor, which corresponds to the Higgs boson in the above analogy, is referred to as the Higgs mode. Its spectroscopic detection has also remained elusive for decades. In recent years, the development of ultrafast techniques enabled an effective approach for studying the mode. Here, we introduce the Higgs mode from a perspective of why superconductors superconduct and review the recent development in Higgs spectroscopy, particularly in the field of nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy. We discuss the novel insights that may be learnt from these studies for future high-Tc superconductivity and correlated materials research in general.

### [6] [Phase-sensitive non-reciprocal transport in high-temperature superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02752)
*Guo-Liang Guo,Xin Liu*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: A planar Josephson junction with s-wave/d-wave/s-wave structure enables the superconducting diode effect, probing d-wave pairing symmetry in high-Tc superconductors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To directly and phase-sensitively probe the d-wave pairing function in high-Tc superconductors and explore nonreciprocal Josephson transport.

Method: Proposing a planar s-wave/d-wave/s-wave Josephson junction to probe the d-wave pairing function, leveraging asymmetric interface coupling to break inversion and time-reversal symmetry.

Result: The SDE emerges with controllable polarity and efficiency by adjusting the d-wave crystallographic orientation or perturbing its intrinsic C4 symmetry.

Conclusion: The study establishes the superconducting diode effect (SDE) as a robust diagnostic tool for high-Tc superconductors and a tunable component for superconducting electronics.

Abstract: We propose the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in a planar s-wave/d-wave/s-wave Josephson junction as a direct phase-sensitive probe of the d-wave pairing function in high-Tc superconductors. Asymmetric interface coupling breaks inversion symmetry and induces a spontaneous Pi/2 phase difference, thereby breaking time-reversal symmetry without a magnetic field. In this TRS-broken state, the SDE emerges when single-Cooper-pair tunneling is enabled at the s-d interfaces, with its polarity and efficiency controllable by rotating the d-wave crystallographic orientation or perturbing its intrinsic C4 symmetry. Our results reveal a robust link between nonreciprocal Josephson transport and pairing symmetry, establishing the SDE as a powerful diagnostic tool for high-Tc superconductors and a tunable element for superconducting electronics.

### [7] [Intrinsic Second-Order Topological Superconductors with Tunable Majorana Zero Modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02775)
*Xiao-Jiao Wang,Yijie Mo,Zhi Wang,Zhigang Wu,Zhongbo Yan*

Main category: cond-mat.supr-con

TL;DR: The paper shows that nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals can host controllable Majorana modes through topological superconductivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate superconductivity in nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals and explore their potential for realizing intrinsic topological superconductivity.

Method: Self-consistent mean-field theory was used to determine the ground-state pairing symmetry in a two-dimensional, square-lattice nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal under on-site repulsive and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions.

Result: An even-parity, spin-singlet $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing was found to be favored, leading to a fully gapped superconducting state and the emergence of Majorana zero modes at the system's boundaries.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals are a promising platform for realizing and manipulating Majorana modes due to their controllable topological superconductivity.

Abstract: Dirac semimetals, with their protected Dirac points, present an ideal platform for realizing intrinsic topological superconductivity. In this work, we investigate superconductivity in a two-dimensional, square-lattice nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal. In the normal state near half-filling, the Fermi surface consists of two distinct pockets, each enclosing a Dirac point at a time-reversal invariant momentum ($\textbf{X}=(π,0)$ and $\textbf{Y}=(0,π)$). Considering an on-site repulsive and nearest-neighbor attractive interaction, we use self-consistent mean-field theory to determine the ground-state pairing symmetry. We find that an even-parity, spin-singlet $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing is favored as it gives rise to a fully gapped superconducting state. Since the pairing amplitude has opposite signs on the two Dirac Fermi pockets, the superconducting state is identified as a second-order topological superconductor. The hallmark of this topological phase is the emergence of Majorana zero modes at the system's boundaries. Notably, the positions of these Majorana modes are highly controllable and can be manipulated simply by tailoring the boundary sublattice terminations. Our results highlight the promise of nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals for realizing and manipulating Majorana modes.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive theoretical comparison between absorption-based and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-based atomic gradient sensing in a four-level tripod system. Both methods were evaluated under identical and optimized physical conditions to ensure a fair and unbiased comparison. The analysis demonstrates that EIT, driven by its steep dispersion response, consistently outperforms conventional absorption detection across a wide range of super-Gaussian beam profiles. Under optimal detuning, EIT achieved up to an order-of-magnitude enhancement in gradient sensitivity and maintained a twofold advantage even under identical detuning. Both approaches reached sub-diffraction spatial resolution in the range of 0.29lambda-0.40lambda, with EIT exhibiting sharper edge contrast and higher localization accuracy. These results confirm EIT as a fundamentally superior approach for precision atomic gradient sensing and sub-wavelength localization, offering clear guidance for the design of next-generation optical and quantum metrology systems.

Result: Simulations show the VQC achieves high prediction accuracy and generalizes well, improving transient response by reducing frequency fluctuations and settling time.

Conclusion: The proposed pure variational quantum circuit (VQC) for secondary frequency control demonstrates high accuracy (over 90%) and generalization ability, significantly improving transient response in power systems.

Abstract: Frequency control in power systems is critical to maintaining stability and preventing blackouts. Traditional methods like meta-heuristic algorithms and machine learning face limitations in real-time applicability and scalability. This paper introduces a novel approach using a pure variational quantum circuit (VQC) for real-time secondary frequency control in diesel generators. Unlike hybrid classical-quantum models, the proposed VQC operates independently during execution, eliminating latency from classical-quantum data exchange. The VQC is trained via supervised learning to map historical frequency deviations to optimal Proportional-Integral (PI) controller parameters using a pre-computed lookup table. Simulations demonstrate that the VQC achieves high prediction accuracy (over 90%) with sufficient quantum measurement shots and generalizes well across diverse test events. The quantum-optimized PI parameters significantly improve transient response, reducing frequency fluctuations and settling time.

TL;DR: Hybrid Quantum-Classical CNNs improve medical image classification accuracy by combining classical and quantum feature extraction, validated by statistical significance tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of quantum machine learning for enhancing feature extraction and classification in high-dimensional data domains, specifically for medical imaging tasks like distinguishing benign and malignant breast tumors.

Method: A hybrid QCNN architecture was developed, integrating classical convolutional feature extraction with two quantum circuits (amplitude-encoding and angle-encoding VQCs). The model was parameter-matched to a classical CNN and trained under identical conditions using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

Result: The hybrid QCNN outperformed the classical CNN, achieving statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy (validated by a one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test, p = 0.03125, and Cohen's d = 2.14).

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) can significantly improve classification accuracy in medical imaging tasks by leveraging quantum entanglement and feature fusion. The work also establishes a framework for evaluating hybrid quantum models in biomedical applications and outlines pathways for future scaling.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve feature extraction and classification tasks in high-dimensional data domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we present a hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) architecture designed for the binary classification of the BreastMNIST dataset, a standardized benchmark for distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tumors. Our architecture integrates classical convolutional feature extraction with two distinct quantum circuits: an amplitude-encoding variational quantum circuit (VQC) and an angle-encoding VQC circuit with circular entanglement, both implemented on four qubits. These circuits generate quantum feature embeddings that are fused with classical features to form a joint feature space, which is subsequently processed by a fully connected classifier. To ensure fairness, the hybrid QCNN is parameter-matched against a baseline classical CNN, allowing us to isolate the contribution of quantum layers. Both models are trained under identical conditions using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Experimental evaluation in five independent runs demonstrates that the hybrid QCNN achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to the classical CNN, as validated by a one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test (p = 0.03125) and supported by large effect size of Cohen's d = 2.14. Our results indicate that hybrid QCNN architectures can leverage entanglement and quantum feature fusion to enhance medical image classification tasks. This work establishes a statistical validation framework for assessing hybrid quantum models in biomedical applications and highlights pathways for scaling to larger datasets and deployment on near-term quantum hardware.

### [12] [From Betti Numbers to Persistence Diagrams: A Hybrid Quantum Algorithm for Topological Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02081)
*Dong Liu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum-classical hybrid algorithm bridges the gap between Betti number computation and persistence diagram acquisition, enhancing practicality and maintaining quantum speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantum topological algorithms like the LGZ algorithm only compute summary statistics (e.g., Betti numbers) and fail to provide practical persistence diagram information, limiting their real-world utility.

Method: The algorithm uses the LGZ quantum algorithm as a feature extractor, mines harmonic form eigenvectors and Betti numbers, constructs topological kernel functions to train a QSVM, and learns the mapping from quantum topological features to persistence diagrams.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves the leap from 'quantum computation of Betti numbers' to 'quantum acquisition of practical persistence diagrams,' maintaining quantum speedup while expanding application scope.

Conclusion: This paper proposes a novel quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that elevates quantum topological computation from statistical summaries to pattern recognition, expanding its practical application value.

Abstract: Persistence diagrams serve as a core tool in topological data analysis, playing a crucial role in pathological monitoring, drug discovery, and materials design. However, existing quantum topological algorithms, such as the LGZ algorithm, can only efficiently compute summary statistics like Betti numbers, failing to provide persistence diagram information that tracks the lifecycle of individual topological features, severely limiting their practical value. This paper proposes a novel quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that achieves, for the first time, the leap from "quantum computation of Betti numbers" to "quantum acquisition of practical persistence diagrams." The algorithm leverages the LGZ quantum algorithm as an efficient feature extractor, mining the harmonic form eigenvectors of the combinatorial Laplacian as well as Betti numbers, constructing specialized topological kernel functions to train a quantum support vector machine (QSVM), and learning the mapping from quantum topological features to persistence diagrams. The core contributions of this algorithm are: (1) elevating quantum topological computation from statistical summaries to pattern recognition, greatly expanding its application value; (2) obtaining more practical topological information in the form of persistence diagrams for real-world applications while maintaining the exponential speedup advantage of quantum computation; (3) proposing a novel hybrid paradigm of "classical precision guiding quantum efficiency." This method provides a feasible pathway for the practical implementation of quantum topological data analysis.

Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism quantifies defect formation during adiabatic passage across a continuous phase transition, providing key insights into universality in quantum many-body systems. We explore counting statistics of defects in adiabatic passage experiments on long 1D Rydberg atom chains. The experiments reveal an anomaly in the defect number distribution at long ramp times, challenging the hypothesis of defect formation through independent domain mergers. Numerical simulations confirm the anomaly and suggest its link to non-critical coarsening dynamics, which we suppress in prepare-and-hold experiments.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A two-step theoretical framework using data complexity and network theory to classify quantum states from snapshots, with applications in 1D systems showing links between algorithmic and computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between quantum snapshots (from projective measurements) and many-body collective properties, and to develop a theoretical framework for classifying quantum states in an interpretable manner.

Method: The method involves a two-step approach: first, applying Occam's razor principle to identify a minimal-complexity measurement basis by analyzing snapshot compressibility; second, using network theory to analyze correlations and build a wave-function network from the minimal-complexity basis data.

Result: The framework successfully links quantum phases of matter to snapshots through data complexity and network theory, enabling stochastic classification of quantum computer outputs. It was applied to 1D translational invariant systems, revealing an interplay between algorithmic and computational complexity.

Conclusion: The framework developed in this paper bridges the gap between quantum snapshots and many-body collective properties, providing a method to classify quantum states without assumptions on the underlying dynamics. It has immediate experimental relevance and potential for further extensions in both mathematical complexity and physical applications.

Abstract: Quantum computers and simulators offer unparalleled capabilities of probing quantum many-body states, by obtaining snapshots of the many-body wave function via collective projective measurements. The probability distribution obtained by such snapshots (which are fundamentally limited to a negligible fraction of the Hilbert space) is of fundamental importance to determine the power of quantum computations. However, its relation to many-body collective properties is poorly understood. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to link quantum phases of matter to their snapshots, based on a combination of data complexity and network theory analyses. The first step in our scheme consists of applying Occam's razor principle to quantum sampling: given snapshots of a wave function, we identify a minimal-complexity measurement basis by analyzing the information compressibility of snapshots over different measurement bases. The second step consists of analyzing arbitrary correlations using network theory, building a wave-function network from the minimal-complexity basis data. This approach allows us to stochastically classify the output of quantum computers and simulations, with no assumptions on the underlying dynamics, and in a fully interpretable manner. We apply this method to quantum states of matter in one-dimensional translational invariant systems, where such classification is exhaustive, and where it reveals an interesting interplay between algorithmic and computational complexity for many-body states. Our framework is of immediate experimental relevance, and can be further extended both in terms of more advanced network mathematics, including discrete homology, as well as in terms of applications to physical phenomena, such as time-dependent dynamics and gauge theories.

### [15] [Quantum Advantage in Resource Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02131)
*William A. Simon,Peter J. Love*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum algorithm for measuring simulation errors shows potential for quantum advantage by significantly reducing computation runtimes, feasible for near-term quantum computers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid progress in quantum hardware, there is a lack of useful applications feasible for near-term quantum computers. The paper aims to identify a practical problem where quantum computers can outperform classical ones.

Method: A quantum algorithm is introduced to measure simulation errors of Trotter-based algorithms, significantly reducing runtimes for quantum computations.

Result: The method reduces runtime by approximately three orders of magnitude for 100-qubit systems, with further reductions predicted for larger systems. The computations involved are infeasible for classical computers, suggesting a practical quantum advantage.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum algorithm for measuring simulation errors demonstrates a significant potential for practical quantum advantage, as it requires relatively few qubits and operations and could be feasible for the next generation of quantum computers.

Abstract: Quantum computing promises the ability to compute properties of quantum systems exponentially faster than classical computers. Quantum advantage is achieved when a practical problem is solved more efficiently on a quantum computer than on a classical computer. Demonstrating quantum advantage requires a powerful quantum computer with low error rates and an efficient quantum algorithm that has a useful application. Despite rapid progress in hardware development, we still lack useful applications that are feasible for the next generation of quantum computers. Here we argue that an exponential quantum advantage exists in producing numerical resource estimates of larger quantum algorithms by accurately measuring simulation errors. We provide a quantum algorithm for measuring simulation errors of Trotter-based algorithms. Our results indicate that this method will reduce runtimes of quantum algorithms by approximately three orders of magnitude for one-hundred qubit systems. We also predict that these reductions will increase with system size. The methods we propose require relatively few qubits and operations, meaning the next generation of quantum computers could compute simulation errors for classically intractable systems. Since the underlying computations that lead to reduced resource estimates are infeasible for classical computers, this task is a candidate for demonstrating practical quantum advantage.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore the potential observable effects of the ER = EPR conjecture, specifically how entangled particles connected by quantum wormholes might influence the properties of the hydrogen atom.

Method: The paper examines the consequences of the ER = EPR conjecture by assuming that some of the electric field from an entangled charged particle leaks into a quantum wormhole, leading to modifications in the hyperfine structure and total charge of the hydrogen atom.

Result: The results indicate that the hyperfine structure of the hydrogen atom would be modified, and if the quantum wormholes are non-traversable, the hydrogen atom would exhibit a non-zero total effective charge.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the ER = EPR conjecture, if valid, would have observable effects on the hyperfine structure and total effective charge of the hydrogen atom, providing constraints on the amplitude of this effect based on high-precision measurements.

Abstract: According to the ER = EPR conjecture, entangled particles are connected by quantum wormholes. Under the assumption that some of the electric field surrounding an entangled charged particle leaks into the wormhole, we show that this effect will modify the hyperfine structure of the hydrogen atom. In addition, if the quantum wormholes are non-traversable, this will also lead to a non-zero total effective charge for the hydrogen atom. These effects provide strong constraints on the amplitude of this potential ER = EPR effect, given high-precision measurements of the hydrogen atom's hyperfine structure and total charge.

TL;DR: The paper examines two senses of completeness in physical theories, linking them to (neo-)Everettian and (neo-)Bohrian interpretations of quantum mechanics, and explores the differences between classical and quantum descriptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the completeness of physical theories, particularly quantum mechanics, by distinguishing two senses of completeness and comparing the (neo-)Everettian and (neo-)Bohrian interpretations.

Method: The paper distinguishes two senses of completeness in physical theories and analyzes how (neo-)Everettian and (neo-)Bohrian approaches align with these senses. It also compares classical and quantum descriptions.

Result: The paper identifies two visions of physics (metaphysical realism and methodological realism) that motivate the two senses of completeness and discusses their implications for quantum and classical descriptions.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that while (neo-)Everett and (neo-)Bohr interpretations of quantum mechanics are diametrically opposed, they can be seen as mutually supporting from their respective perspectives, highlighting the differences between quantum and classical descriptions.

Abstract: I distinguish two senses in which one can take a given physical theory to be `complete'. On the first, a complete physical theory is one that, in principle, completely describes physical reality. On the second, a complete physical theory is one that provides all of the conceptual resources one needs to describe any (in general probabilistic) physical phenomenon to any level of detail one likes, in principle. I argue that while the (neo-)Everettian approach to interpreting quantum mechanics aims to show that it is complete in the first sense, the (neo-)Bohrian approach begins from an understanding of quantum mechanics as being complete in the second sense. I then discuss some of the essential differences between how classical and quantum theory describe phenomena, and the way in which the quantum description can be thought of as a ``natural generalisation'' (to use Bohr's phrase) of the classical description. Finally, I elaborate upon the two visions of physics from which one can motivate the first and the second sense of completeness, respectively: \emph{metaphysical realism}, on the one hand, and what I will call \emph{methodological realism}, on the other -- and discuss what one can say about the significance of the differences between quantum and classical description from each of these points of view. I suggest that there is a sense in which the views of (neo-)Everett and the views of (neo-)Bohr can be understood to be mutually supporting positions, from their respective perspectives, even though they are diametrically opposed.

Abstract: We investigate state estimation in discrete-time quantum walks with a single absorbing boundary. Using a spectral approach, we obtain closed expressions for the escape probability as a function of the coin state and the boundary position, and their corresponding classical Fisher information for a simple absorption readout. Comparing with the single-copy quantum Fisher information shows a clear complementarity: near boundaries carry broad information about the population angle of the coin, whereas moderate or distant boundaries reveal phase-sensitive regions. Because a single boundary probes only one information direction, combining two boundary placements yields a full-rank Fisher matrix and tight joint Cramér--Rao bounds, while retaining a binary, tomography-free measurement. We outline an integrated-photonics implementation in which an on-chip sink realizes the absorber and estimate a substantial reduction in configuration count compared to mode-resolved qubit tomography. These results identify absorption in quantum walks as a simple and scalable primitive for coin-state metrology.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement offers powerful opportunities for enhancing measurement sensitivity beyond classical limits, with optical atomic clocks serving as a leading platform for such advances. This chapter introduces the principles of entanglement-enhanced quantum metrology and explores their applications to timekeeping. We review the theoretical framework of quantum phase estimation, comparing frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and discuss paradigmatic entangled states such as spin-squeezed and GHZ states. Particular emphasis is placed on the challenges posed by decoherence, which constrain the practical advantages that can be realized in large-scale devices. The discussion then turns to frequency estimation in atomic clocks, highlighting how experimental constraints shape the translation of abstract quantum limits into real performance gains. Finally, we outline emerging directions of contemporary quantum metrology. Together, these developments underscore the increasingly close interplay between quantum information processing and precision metrology.

### [20] [Enhanced readout contrast of V2 ensembles in 4H-SiC through resonant optical excitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02235)
*Infiter Tathfif,Samuel G. Carter*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Resonant excitation at cryogenic temperatures boosts ODMR contrast in V2 defects, offering 100x improvement and enhanced sensitivity for quantum sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the promising properties of the V2 silicon vacancy defect in 4H-SiC for quantum technologies, its low ODMR readout contrast at room temperature (<1%) poses a challenge. The study aims to address this limitation.

Method: The researchers used resonant excitation at cryogenic temperatures on V2 ensembles in 4H-SiC, comparing the results with off-resonant excitation. They measured ODMR contrast and sensitivity under varying laser powers and temperatures.

Result: A maximum ODMR contrast of 50% was achieved with 2 μW of resonant laser power, a 100 times improvement over off-resonant excitation. The contrast decreased with temperature, reverting to non-resonant levels by 60 K. A sensitivity of 100 nT/√Hz was achieved with 300 μW of resonant power.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that resonant excitation at cryogenic temperatures significantly enhances the ODMR contrast of V2 silicon vacancy defects in 4H-SiC, achieving a 100-fold improvement. This approach also improves magnetic field sensitivity, making the V2 defect a more viable candidate for quantum sensing applications.

Abstract: The V2 silicon vacancy defect in 4H-SiC has emerged as a promising system for quantum technologies due to its favorable optical and spin properties and the advantages of the SiC host. However, the readout contrast - an important benchmark for quantum sensing - of V2 ensembles for optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is relatively low, usually <1$\%$ at room temperature. To overcome this challenge, we resonantly excite the V2 ensembles at cryogenic temperatures and compare the results with the off-resonant case. We report a maximum ODMR contrast of 50$\%$ with only 2 $μ$W of resonant laser power, almost 100 times improvement over off-resonant excitation. We attribute this high readout contrast to a subset of V2 centers that have one spin-selective optical transition resonant with the laser. The ODMR contrast decreases with temperature, approaching the non-resonant contrast by 60 K, likely due to broadening of the optical transition linewidths. We achieve a maximum sensitivity of 100 nT/$\sqrt{Hz}$ with a resonant laser power of 300 $μ$W, while 100 times more non-resonant excitation power is needed to achieve comparable sensitivity.

Abstract: A particle initially in a pure state but interacting with some environment evolves into a discrete ensemble of pure states, the eigenstates of its reduced density operator, with ensemble probabilities given by the corresponding eigenvalues. In this work, we use numerics to present explicit results for the time-dependence of these eigenvalues and eigenstates for simple scattering experiments in one and two dimensions. This provides a time-resolved picture of the scattering process, showing in detail how an initial state described entirely in terms of continuous parameters evolves into a discrete set of possible outcomes, each with an associated probability and time-evolving wavefunction. We find that for scattering of Gaussian wavepackets in one dimension, the late time spectrum is dominated by two large eigenvalues nearly equal to the transmission and reflection probabilities associated with the central value of momentum. The corresponding eigenstates appear as single-peaked reflected or transmitted wavepackets. The remaining smaller eigenvalues, which increase to a maximum during scattering and then decrease to small values, correspond to reflected or transmitted wavepackets with multiple spatially separated parts. In this case and also for two-dimensional scattering, we find that successively smaller eigenvalues correspond to probability distributions with successively more peaks. These multi-peaked states correspond to outcomes of the scattering experiment where a particle initially in a single wavepacket ends up in a superposition of separated wavepackets after scattering.

Abstract: Circulators are nonreciprocal devices that enable directional signal routing. Nonreciprocity, which requires time-reversal symmetry breaking, can be produced in waveguides in which the propagation medium moves relative to the waveguide at a moderate fraction of the wave speed. Motivated by this effect, here we propose a design for nonreciprocal microwave transmission based on an extended, annular Josephson junction, in which the propagation medium consists of a train of moving fluxons. We show how to harness this to build a high-quality resonant microwave circulator, and we theoretically evaluate the anticipated performance of such a device.

Abstract: The prevailing view is that quantum phenomena can be harnessed to tackle certain problems beyond the reach of classical approaches. Quantifying this capability as a quantum-classical separation and demonstrating it on current quantum processors has remained elusive. Using a superconducting qubit processor, we show that quantum contextuality enables certain tasks to be performed with success probabilities beyond classical limits. With a few qubits, we illustrate quantum contextuality with the magic square game, as well as quantify it through a Kochen--Specker--Bell inequality violation. To examine many-body contextuality, we implement the N-player GHZ game and separately solve a 2D hidden linear function problem, exceeding classical success rate in both. Our work proposes novel ways to benchmark quantum processors using contextuality-based algorithms.

Conclusion: The study unifies equilibrium and non-equilibrium frameworks in quantum metrology for many-body systems, providing upper bounds for the quantum Fisher information in thermal probe states and demonstrating their applicability across different models.

Abstract: This work unifies the equilibrium and non-equilibrium frameworks of quantum metrology within the context of many-body systems. We investigate dynamic sensing schemes to derive an upper bound on the quantum Fisher information for probe states in thermal equilibrium with their environment. We establish that the dynamic quantum Fisher information for a thermal probe state is upper bounded by the degree of non-commutation between the transformed local generator and the Hamiltonian for the thermal state. Furthermore, we show that this upper bound scales as the square of the product of the inverse temperature and the evolution time. In the low-temperature limit, we establish an additional upper bound expressed as the seminorm of the commutator divided by the energy gap. We apply this thermal dynamic sensing scheme to various models, demonstrating that the dynamic quantum Fisher information satisfies the established upper bounds.

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) holds the promise of enhancing machine learning modeling in terms of both complexity and accuracy. A key challenge in this domain is the encoding of input data, which plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of QML models. In this work, we tackle a largely unaddressed aspect of encoding that is unique to QML modeling -- rather than adjusting the ansatz used for encoding, we consider adjusting how data is conveyed to the ansatz. We specifically implement QML pipelines that leverage classical data manipulation (i.e., ordering, selecting, and weighting features) as a preprocessing step, and evaluate if these aspects of encoding can have a significant impact on QML model performance, and if they can be effectively optimized to improve performance. Our experimental results, applied across a wide variety of data sets, ansatz, and circuit sizes, with a representative QML approach, demonstrate that by optimizing how features are encoded in an ansatz we can substantially and consistently improve the performance of QML models, making a compelling case for integrating these techniques in future QML applications. Finally we demonstrate the practical feasibility of this approach by running it using real quantum hardware with 100 qubit circuits and successfully achieving improved QML modeling performance in this case as well.

TL;DR: Non-unitary quantum dynamics with specific spectral properties exhibit exponentially slow purification, linking eigenvalue distribution patterns to quantum chaos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how purification dynamics in non-unitary quantum systems relate to spectral properties and quantum chaos, particularly focusing on the delayed purification effect.

Method: The research employs the analysis of eigenvalue distributions in the complex plane for systems with fixed, non-unitary evolution operators involving global Haar random unitary operators and non-unitary single-qubit operations. Spectral form factor calculations were also performed.

Result: Exponentially slow purification is linked to a ring-shaped eigenvalue distribution with sharp edges, where the eigenvalue density is exponentially large near these edges. Level attraction along the radial direction and repulsion azimuthally are observed.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that exponentially slow purification in non-unitary quantum dynamics arises from specific spectral properties of the evolution operator, connecting this behavior to quantum chaos and sensitivity to initial conditions.

Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics generated by the repeated action of a non-unitary evolution operator on a system of qubits. Breaking unitarity can lead to the purification of mixed initial states, which corresponds to the loss of sensitivity to initial conditions, and hence the absence of a key signature of dynamical chaos. However, the scrambling of quantum information can delay purification to times that are exponential in system size. Here we study purification in systems whose evolution operators are fixed in time, where all aspects of the dynamics are in principle encoded in spectral properties of the evolution operator for a single time step. The operators that we study consist of global Haar random unitary operators and non-unitary single-qubit operations. We show that exponentially slow purification arises from a distribution of eigenvalues in the complex plane that forms a ring with sharp edges at large radii, with the eigenvalue density exponentially large near these edges. We argue that the sharp edges of the eigenvalue distribution arise from level attraction along the radial direction in the complex plane. By calculating the spectral form factor we also show that there is level repulsion around the azimuthal direction, even close to the outer edge of the ring of eigenvalues. Our results connect this spectral signature of quantum chaos to the sensitivity of the system to its initial conditions.

*Ronit Shah*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Classical dits are as effective as qudits for message guessing without entanglement; sharp bounds for mixed-state discrimination are derived.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the limitations and advantages of quantum communication (qudits) compared to classical communication (classical dits) in scenarios where the goal is to maximize the probability of correct message guessing.

Method: The paper employs mathematical proofs and analysis, focusing on quantum information theory. It examines scenarios where Alice sends a qudit to Bob and compares it to classical communication.

Result: No advantage is found in using qudits over classical dits for message guessing without prior entanglement. A sharp upper bound for discriminating mixed quantum states is also established.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that sending a classical dit is equally effective as sending a qudit in maximizing Bob's guessing probability, without prior entanglement. The study also extends this finding to mixed states, providing a sharp upper bound for discrimination success.

Abstract: We consider the following simple scenario: Alice has one of many possible messages, drawn from a known distribution, and wants to maximize the probability that Bob guesses her message correctly. We prove that if Alice can send only a qudit to Bob, without preshared entanglement, there is never any advantage over sending him a classical dit. This result was previously known only for a uniform distribution.
  We also prove a mixed-state generalization of this result in the form of an upper bound on the success probability of discriminating between mixed quantum states with a single measurement. This bound is based solely on the dimension, probability distribution, and eigenvalues of the states and is sharp among such bounds.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate and classify the steady-state phases of $ℤ_2$-symmetric monitored, open quantum dynamics, focusing on information retention, leakage, and observer learning.

Method: The study employs information-theoretic diagnostics, symmetry-breaking analysis, and path integral techniques to describe the phases. Numerical evidence is obtained through tensor network simulations of the doubled state.

Result: The study identifies distinct phases: a completely broken phase (information retained), a strong-to-weak broken phase (information leaked), and an unbroken phase (information learned by the observer). The path integral analysis reveals connections to the classical 2d random-bond Ising model, with critical behavior observed at a self-dual point.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the steady-state phases in $ℤ_2$-symmetric monitored, open quantum dynamics, highlighting the interplay between information retention, leakage, and observer learning. The path integral framework and numerical simulations validate the proposed phases and critical behavior.

Abstract: We investigate the steady-state phases of generic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric monitored, open quantum dynamics. We describe the phases systematically in terms of both information-theoretic diagnostics and spontaneous breaking of strong and weak symmetries of the dynamics. We find a completely broken phase where information is retained by the quantum system, a strong-to-weak broken phase where information is leaked to the environment, and an unbroken phase where information is learned by the observer. We find that weak measurement and dephasing alone constitute a minimal model for generic open systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, but we also explore perturbations by unitary gates. For a 1d set of qubits, we examine information-theoretic and symmetry-breaking observables in the path integral of the doubled state. This path integral reduces to the standard classical 2d random-bond Ising model in certain limits but generically involves negative weights, enabling a special self-dual random-bond Ising model at the critical point when only measurements are present. We obtain numerical evidence for the steady-state phases using efficient tensor network simulations of the doubled state.

Motivation: To address the internal inconsistency and structural incompleteness in the prevailing framework for superchannels, which lacks representations analogous to those in channel theory.

Method: Combines tensor-network methods with a generalized Occam's razor to establish a unified foundation for superchannels, including connections between Choi formulations and developing Kraus, Stinespring, and Liouville representations.

Result: Develops a unified framework for superchannels, establishes connections between competing Choi formulations, and provides tools to characterize superchannels that affect quantum correlations or causal structure.

Conclusion: The paper resolves the inconsistencies and incompleteness in the superchannel framework, providing a unified foundation and enabling characterizations of superchannels affecting quantum correlations or causal structure, which advances the understanding of non-Markovian quantum dynamics.

Abstract: Quantum channels function as the operational primitives of quantum theory, while superchannels describe the most general transformations acting upon them. Yet the prevailing framework for superchannels is both internally inconsistent, owing to the coexistence of distinct Choi operator constructions, and structurally incomplete, lacking the analogue of representations that ground channel theory. We resolve these issues by combining tensor-network methods with a generalized Occam's razor introduced here, establishing a unified foundation for superchannels. Our framework establishes the connections between competing Choi formulations, develops the Kraus, Stinespring, and Liouville representations for superchannels, and provides a simplified derivation of the realization theorem that identifies the minimal memory required to implement a given transformation. These structural tools also enable characterizations of superchannels that destroy quantum correlations or causal structure, opening a systematic route to non-Markovian quantum dynamics.

TL;DR: A single atom-based quantum jump photodetector (QJPD) detects photon-level signals in strong sunlight, validated by a rate-equation model, with applications in LIDAR and optical communications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting few-photon signals in a broadband background, particularly in strong sunlight, for applications such as daytime LIDAR and remote magnetometry.

Method: A single rubidium atom is used as a quantum jump photodetector to count narrow-band laser photons embedded in strong sunlight. A rate-equation model for the atom's internal-state dynamics is derived and validated experimentally.

Result: The QJPD achieves a channel capacity of 0.5 bits per symbol for weak coherent states in the presence of sunlight, with quantitative agreement between the derived model and experimental results.

Conclusion: The QJPD approach, demonstrated using a single rubidium atom, effectively detects photon-level signals in strong sunlight, showing potential for applications like LIDAR, magnetometry, and optical communications.

Abstract: The detection of few-photon signals in a broadband background is an extreme challenge for photon counting, requiring filtering that accepts a narrow range of optical frequencies while strongly rejecting all others. Recent work [Zarraoa et. al, Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033338 (2024)] demonstrated that trapped single atoms can act as low dark-count narrow-band photodetectors. Here we show that this ``quantum jump photodetector'' (QJPD) approach can also detect photon-level signals embedded in strong sunlight. Using a single rubidium atom as a QJPD, we count arrivals of individual narrow-band laser photons embedded in sunlight powers of order $10^{10}$ photons/s. We derive a rate-equation model for the atom's internal-state dynamics in sunlight, and find quantitative agreement with experiment. Using this model, we calculate the channel capacity over a noisy communication channel when sending weak coherent states and detecting them in the presence of sunlight, achieving a representative rate of 0.5 bits per symbol when sending 150 probe photons per 10 ms time-bin, embedded in 1 nW of sunlight (of order $10^{10}$ photons/s in the visible and near-infrared bands). The demonstration may benefit background-limited applications such as daytime light detection and ranging (LIDAR), remote magnetometry, and free-space classical and quantum optical communications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the time-domain dynamics of magnon-photon systems with remote coupling and demonstrate level attraction mediated by an auxiliary mode.

Method: Frequency-domain and time-domain ring-down measurements were used to observe the temporal evolution and confirm level attraction in dissipatively coupled cavity-magnon modes.

Result: Direct observation of dissipative coupling dynamics and confirmation of predicted level attraction in frequency-domain measurements.

Conclusion: The study provides a versatile platform for exploring tunable, non-Hermitian physics, with in situ control over dissipative coupling strength.

Abstract: Evidence of non-hermitian behavior has been recently demonstrated in cavity magnonics, including the emergence of mode level attraction and exceptional points in spectroscopic measurements. This work demonstrates experimental evidence of time-domain dynamics of magnon-photon systems that are coupled through a long-range interaction (i.e. remote coupling) exhibiting level attraction mediated by an auxiliary mode. We directly observe the temporal evolution of dissipatively coupled cavity-magnon modes, where heavily damped transmission line modes mediate the interaction. Our frequency-domain measurements confirm the predicted level attraction, while time-domain ring-down measurements reveal the characteristic signatures of dissipative coupling dynamics. Our approach offers in situ tunability over the dissipative coupling strength, including complete suppression, without requiring physical modifications to the experimental setup, providing a versatile platform for exploring tunable, non-Hermitian physics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the importance of dispersive readout in quantum technology and its measurement information.

Method: A full-counting-statistics framework for dispersive readout and a generalized mean-field approach for non-unitary dynamics are developed.

Result: The Fisher information shows exponential dependence on the squeezing parameter and robustness against residual nonlinearity, approaching the quantum Fisher information.

Conclusion: The study introduces a streamlined and computationally efficient framework for continuous quantum measurements, enhancing its applicability in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Motivated by the importance of dispersive readout in quantum technology, we study a prototypical dispersive readout setup that is probed by a squeezed vacuum in a time-reversal-symmetric fashion. To this end, we develop a full-counting-statistics framework for dispersive readout and analyze its measurement information, accompanied by a generalized mean-field approach suitable to deal with non-unitary dynamics. Distinct from conventional input-output theory, our full-counting-statistics approach enables the direct calculation of arbitrary-order cumulants for the measured cumulative (i.e., time-integrated) photonic distribution while maintaining applicability to nonlinear systems. The corresponding Fisher information exhibits an exponential dependence on the squeezing parameter and a robustness against residual nonlinearity, which can even approach the quantum Fisher information, setting an upper limit. This work introduces a conceptually streamlined and computationally efficient framework for continuous quantum measurements, making it well suited for widespread adoption in quantum technologies.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: CODA is a scalable, optimization-based scheduler for FTQC, reducing undecoded sequences by 74% while bypassing combinatorial explosion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The resource shortage in large-scale FTQC systems due to the limited number of decoders compared to logical qubits necessitates efficient scheduling policies like CODA.

Method: CODA, an optimization-based scheduling algorithm, is introduced to minimize the longest undecoded sequence length by considering global circuit structure.

Result: CODA achieves a 74% average reduction in the longest undecoded sequence length across 19 benchmark circuits and scales linearly with the number of qubits.

Conclusion: The proposed CODA algorithm effectively addresses the limitations of the MLS heuristic by leveraging global circuit structure, resulting in a 74% reduction in the longest undecoded sequence length. It ensures scalability and efficiency in large-scale FTQC systems.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) requires fast and accurate decoding of Quantum Error Correction (QEC) syndromes. However, in large-scale systems, the number of available decoders is much smaller than the number of logical qubits, leading to a fundamental resource shortage. To address this limitation, Virtualized Quantum Decoder (VQD) architectures have been proposed to share a limited pool of decoders across multiple qubits. While the Minimize Longest Undecoded Sequence (MLS) heuristic has been introduced as an effective scheduling policy within the VQD framework, its locally greedy decision-making structure limits its ability to consider global circuit structure, causing inefficiencies in resource balancing and limited scalability. In this work, we propose Constraint-Optimal Driven Allocation (CODA), an optimization-based scheduling algorithm that leverages global circuit structure to minimize the longest undecoded sequence length. Across 19 benchmark circuits, CODA achieves an average 74\% reduction in the longest undecoded sequence length. Crucially, while the theoretical search space scales exponentially with circuit size, CODA effectively bypasses this combinatorial explosion. Our evaluation confirms that the scheduling time scales linearly with the number of qubits, determined by physical resource constraints rather than the combinatorial search space, ensuring robust scalability for large-scale FTQC systems. These results demonstrate that CODA provides a global optimization-based, scalable scheduling solution that enables efficient decoder virtualization in large-scale FTQC systems.

Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: The Phononic Casimir effect between planar objects is investigated by deriving a formalism from the quantum partition function of the system following multiscattering approach. This fluctuation-induced coupling is mediated by phonons modeled as an effective elastic medium. We find that excitations with three types of polarizations arise from the resolved boundary conditions, however the coupling is dominated by only one of these degrees of freedom due to exponential suppression effects in the other two. The obtained scaling laws and dependence on materials properties and temperature suggest effective pathways of interaction control. Scenarios of materials combinations are envisioned where the Phononic Casimir effect is of similar order as the standard Casimir interaction mediated by electromagnetic fluctuations.

Conclusion: 引言创造了一个可扩展、实验可行的光学平台，统一了量子通信、计量和计算所需的状态资源。

Abstract: Quantum technologies, encompassing communication, computation, and metrology, rely on the generation and control of non-Gaussian states of light. These states enable secure quantum communication, fault-tolerant quantum computation, and precision sensing beyond classical limits, yet their practical realisation remains a major challenge due to reliance on high-photon-number Fock states or strong non-linearities. Here we introduce a unified optical framework that removes this constraint, using only Gaussian inputs, optical parametric amplification, and heralded photon detection. Within a single architecture, we demonstrate the generation of photon-added squeezed states with near unit fidelity, cubic-phase-like states with strong non-linearities and fidelities above 98.5%, and squeezed-cat states exceeding 99% fidelity that can be iteratively bred into GKP grid states surpassing the 9.75 dB fault-tolerance threshold. Operating entirely below 3 dB of input squeezing, the approach provides a scalable, experimentally accessible platform that unites the state resources required for quantum communication, metrology, and computation within one coherent optical framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the sensitivity of high-harmonic generation in organic molecular crystals to laser polarization and intermolecular coupling, building on previous findings by Wiechmann et al.

Method: The research employs a two-dimensional tight-binding system modeling a molecular dimer to examine the effects of laser polarization angle and intermolecular interaction on harmonic yield.

Result: Lower harmonic orders maximize for laser polarization along molecular axes, while higher harmonics show the strongest yield along intermolecular axes. The flip in maximum yield direction depends on intermolecular coupling strength.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the harmonic yield in organic molecular crystals is influenced by laser polarization angle and intermolecular coupling, with lower harmonics maximizing along molecular axes and higher harmonics along intermolecular axes, providing insights into electron dynamics.

Abstract: The generation of high harmonics is a strongly nonlinear effect that allows to probe properties of the target and to study electron dynamics in matter. It has been investigated in many different kinds of targets, including molecular gases, liquids and solids. Recently, high-harmonic generation was studied in organic molecular crystals by Wiechmann et al. [Nat. Commun. 16, 9890 (2025)]. It was found that the laser-polarization-dependent harmonic yield is sensitive to the weak couplings between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor molecules. In this paper, the impact of the laser polarization angle and the intermolecular interaction on the harmonic yield is examined in detail using a simple but insightful two-dimensional tight-binding system that models a molecular dimer, i.e. two weakly coupled molecules. We find that the intensities of lower harmonic orders tend to maximize for a laser polarization direction aligning with the molecular axes, whereas higher harmonic orders rather show the strongest yield for a polarization direction along the intermolecular axis. We further demonstrate that the harmonic order at which the maximum flips from the molecular to the intermolecular direction strongly depends on the intermolecular coupling strength. To gain a deeper insight into the origins of the findings, we include a detailed adiabatic analysis, showing that the flipping of the maximum yield towards the intermolecular direction is already contained qualitatively in the adiabatically following states.

Motivation: To overcome the limitations of monolithic fabrication strategies and optimize materials and technologies for each processor component.

Result: Demonstration of a chiplet-based addressing system for a ten-ion crystal, achieving diffraction-limited focal spots.

Conclusion: The modular chiplet approach offers a flexible and efficient way to fabricate a trapped-ion quantum processor by allowing optimal materials and technologies for each component, demonstrated successfully with an integrated ion addressing system.

Abstract: Trapped ions are among the most promising platforms for realizing a large-scale quantum information processor. Current progress focuses on integrating optical and electronic components into microfabricated ion traps to allow scaling to large numbers of ion qubits. Most available fabrication strategies for such integrated processors employ monolithic integration of all processor components and rely heavily on CMOS-compatible semiconductor fabrication technologies that are not optimized for the requirements of a trapped-ion quantum processor. In this work, we present a modular approach in which the processor modules, called chiplets, have specific functions and are fabricated separately. The individual chiplets are then combined using heterogeneous integration techniques. This strategy opens up the possibility of choosing the optimal materials and fabrication technology for each of the chiplets, with a minimum amount of fabrication limitations compared to the monolithic approach. Chiplet technology furthermore enables novel processor functionalities to be added in a cost-effective, modular fashion by adding or modifying only a subset of the chiplets. We describe the design concept of a chiplet-based trapped-ion quantum processor and demonstrate the technology with an example of an integrated individual-ion addressing system for a ten-ion crystal. The addressing system emphasizes the modularity of the chiplet approach, combining a surface ion trap manufactured on a glass substrate with a silicon substrate carrying integrated waveguides and a stack of 3D-printed micro-optics, achieving diffraction-limited focal spots at the ion positions.

Conclusion: The deployment of a multi-node quantum network in Cyprus successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using existing telecom infrastructure for quantum-secured communication, marking progress toward scalable and cost-effective quantum networks.

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers unconditional information security by allowing two distant users to establish a common encryption key resilient to hacking. Resultingly, QKD networks interconnecting critical infrastructure and enabling the secure exchange of classified information, can provide a solution to the increasing number of successful cyberattacks. To efficiently deploy quantum networks, the technology must be integrated over existing communication infrastructure, such as optical fibre links. Yet, QKD poses stringent requirements on the conditions of the network over which it is deployed. This work demonstrates the first quantum communication network in Cyprus via the deployment of a multi-node quantum network, exploiting existing commercial underground optical fibre. The network employs bidirectional occupation of fibres and wavelength multiplexing in a ring architecture to achieve, with minimal use of dark fibres, high-rate QKD. Results obtained reveal consistent key generation rates across all nodes, confirming reliable operation in a real-world environment. This deployment highlights the feasibility of leveraging existing telecom infrastructure for quantum-secured communication, marking a significant step toward scalable and cost-effective quantum networks suited for critical applications.

Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently training quantum Boltzmann machines for Born-rule generative modeling, as prior methods were inefficient.

Method: Utilizes the Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of classical relative entropy and the quantum Boltzmann gradient estimator to train quantum Boltzmann machines, including an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine ansatz.

Result: Proposes a practical solution for training quantum Boltzmann machines and presents hybrid quantum-classical algorithms with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: The paper presents practical training methods for quantum Boltzmann machines, extending the findings to other distinguishability measures and proposing hybrid quantum-classical algorithms with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Born-rule generative modeling, a central task in quantum machine learning, seeks to learn probability distributions that can be efficiently sampled by measuring complex quantum states. One hope is for quantum models to efficiently capture probability distributions that are difficult to learn and simulate by classical means alone. Quantum Boltzmann machines were proposed about one decade ago for this purpose, yet efficient training methods have remained elusive. In this paper, I overcome this obstacle by proposing a practical solution that trains quantum Boltzmann machines for Born-rule generative modeling. Two key ingredients in the proposal are the Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of the classical relative entropy and the quantum Boltzmann gradient estimator of [Patel et al., arXiv:2410.12935]. I present the main result for a more general ansatz known as an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine [Minervini et al., arXiv:2501.03367], which combines parameterized real- and imaginary-time evolution. I also show how to extend the findings to other distinguishability measures beyond relative entropy. Finally, I present four different hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for the minimax optimization underlying training, and I discuss their theoretical convergence guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and classifying multipartite entanglement is crucial for quantum information processing. AME states, known for their maximal entanglement, serve as a key focus.

Method: A numerical algorithm was developed to compute the minimal decomposition entropy for finite q>1, applied to AME and Haar random states in qubit, qutrit, and ququad systems for q=2 and q=∞.

Result: For q=2, AME states of four qutrits and four ququads showed smaller minimal decomposition entropy than Haar random states. For q=∞, AME states exhibited higher entanglement. The algorithm also generated simpler and sparser AME state decompositions.

Conclusion: These findings highlight the utility of minimal decomposition entropy in quantifying multipartite entanglement, particularly for AME states, and provide a practical tool for their analysis and classification.

Abstract: Understanding and classifying multipartite entanglement is fundamental to quantum information processing. A useful measure of multipartite entanglement is the minimal decomposition entropy, defined as the minimum of the Rényi entropy $ S_q $ associated with the state's decomposition over all local product bases. This quantity identifies the product bases in which the state is maximally localized, thereby yielding optimal representations for analyzing local-unitary equivalence and structural properties of multipartite states.
  We investigate the minimal decomposition entropy for absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states, a class of highly entangled states characterized by their maximal entanglement across any bipartitions. We present a numerical algorithm for computing the minimal decomposition entropy for finite $ q>1 $. Entropy distributions for AME and Haar random states are obtained for $ q=2 $ and $ q=\infty $ in qubit, qutrit, and ququad systems. For $ q=2 $, AME states of four qutrits and four ququads exhibit smaller minimal decomposition entropy than Haar random states, indicating more localized optimal representations. For $ q=\infty $, corresponding to the geometric measure of entanglement, AME states display higher entanglement than Haar random states. The algorithm additionally produces simpler and sparser decompositions of known AME states, aiding in distinguishing genuinely quantum AME states from those associated with classical combinatorial designs.

Method: Experimental realization of a non-Hermitian XY model in a strongly-interacting Rydberg-atom array, with measurement of the Loschmidt Echo of a fully polarized state.

Result: Distinct dynamical signatures of a PT-symmetry-breaking phase transition were observed, with dipole interactions playing a crucial role in determining the transition point and triggering a non-Hermitian many-body blockade effect.

Conclusion: The study reveals intricate interaction-induced effects on PT-symmetry breaking and opens new avenues for exploring non-Hermitian many-body dynamics beyond single-particle and mean-field paradigms.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics with parity-time (PT) symmetry offers a powerful framework for exploring the complex interplay of dissipation and coherent interactions in open quantum systems. While PT-symmetry breaking has been studied in various physical systems, its observation on a quantum many-body level remains elusive. Here, we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian XY model in a strongly-interacting Rydberg-atom array. By measuring the Loschmidt Echo of a fully polarized state, we observe distinct dynamical signatures of a PT-symmetry-breaking phase transition. Dipole interactions are found to play a crucial role, not only determining the transition point but also triggering a non-Hermitian many-body blockade effect that protects the Loschmidt Echo from decay with a non-monotonic dependence on the system size. Our results reveal intricate interaction-induced effects on PT-symmetry breaking and open the door for exploring non-Hermitian many-body dynamics beyond single-particle and mean-field paradigms.

Motivation: The research aims to address whether constant qubit overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation is achievable under general, non-stochastic noise models, extending prior work limited to stochastic noise.

Method: The study employs quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes with constant rate and linear minimum distance. It develops a fault-tolerant error correction scheme and a method for implementing logic gates under general circuit noise, modeled via the diamond norm.

Result: The results demonstrate that constant qubit overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation is achievable under a general noise model, including coherent and amplitude damping noise, using QLDPC codes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that constant qubit overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation is achievable under a general circuit-level noise model, extending previous results limited to stochastic noise. This broadens the theoretical foundations of fault-tolerant quantum computation and suggests new directions for practical fault-tolerant architectures.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation traditionally incurs substantial resource overhead, with both qubit and time overheads scaling polylogarithmically with the size of the computation. While prior work by Gottesman showed that constant qubit overhead is achievable under stochastic noise using quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, it has remained an open question whether similar guarantees hold under more general, non-stochastic noise models. In this work, we address this question by considering a general circuit-level noise model defined via the diamond norm, which captures both stochastic and non-stochastic noise, including coherent and amplitude damping noise. We prove that constant qubit overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation is achievable in this general setting, using QLDPC codes with constant rate and linear minimum distance. To establish our result, we develop a fault-tolerant error correction scheme and a method for implementing logic gates under general circuit noise. These results extend the theoretical foundations of fault-tolerant quantum computation and offer new directions for fault-tolerant architectures under realistic noise models.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores topological ground state degeneracy in quantum systems with long-range interactions, showing stretched exponential scaling of splitting using path integral and analytical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to investigate the stability of topological ground state degeneracy in quantum many-body systems under long-range interactions, particularly those decaying as a power-law $1/r^\alpha$ where $\alpha$ is smaller than the spatial dimension. This addresses a gap in existing stability theorems.

Method: The study employs path integral techniques, specifically a method similar to Coleman's instanton approach, to compute the ground state splitting in toy models. Additionally, another toy model is analyzed without path integral techniques to validate the results.

Result: The main result is the computation of ground state splitting in several toy models, showing that the splitting $\delta$ scales as a stretched exponential $\delta \sim \exp(-C L^{\frac{1+\alpha}{2}})$, where $L$ is the system size. This behavior is consistent across models and methodologies.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the robustness of topological ground state degeneracy to long-range interactions in quantum many-body systems, even beyond the scope of known stability theorems. The findings suggest that such systems can exhibit stretched exponential scaling of ground state splitting, providing insights into the behavior of long-range interacting models.

Abstract: We study the robustness of topological ground state degeneracy to long-range interactions in quantum many-body systems. We focus on slowly decaying two-body interactions that scale like a power-law $1/r^α$ where $α$ is smaller than the spatial dimension; such interactions are beyond the reach of known stability theorems which only apply to short-range or rapidly decaying long-range perturbations. Our main result is a computation of the ground state splitting of several toy models, which are variants of the 1D Ising model $H = -\sum_i σ^z_i σ^z_{i+1} + λ\sum_{ij} |i-j|^{-α} σ^x_i σ^x_j$ with $λ> 0$ and $α< 1$. These models are also closely connected to the Kitaev p-wave wire model with power-law density-density interactions. In these examples, we find that the splitting $δ$ scales like a stretched exponential $δ\sim \exp(-C L^{\frac{1+α}{2}})$ where $L$ is the system size. Our computations are based on path integral techniques similar to the instanton method introduced by Coleman.

TL;DR: Quantum voting's QMR constitution is resilient to moderate noise but shifts under strong noise. An entanglement-based variant reveals noise-sensitive behaviors, aiding future quantum voting protocol design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how realistic noise affects the quantum majority rule (QMR) constitution and to explore the behavior of quantum voting protocols under noise, bridging abstract theory with practical implementation on NISQ devices.

Method: The paper evaluates the QMR constitution analytically on classical profile data and implements its final measurement stage as a quantum circuit. Experiments are conducted on noiseless simulators and noisy IBM quantum hardware to study the impact of noise on societal ranking distributions. An entanglement-based variant (QMR2-inspired) is also explored.

Result: Moderate-high single-qubit noise does not alter the qualitative behavior of QMR, whereas strong noise shifts the societal ranking distribution toward other dominant winners. The entanglement-based variant demonstrates different noise responses for GHZ-type and separable superpositions.

Conclusion: The study connects the abstract QMR constitution to concrete implementations on NISQ devices, highlighting design considerations for future quantum voting protocols. It shows that moderate-high noise does not qualitatively change QMR's behavior, while strong noise shifts the distribution toward different dominant winners.

Abstract: Quantum voting, inspired by quantum game theory, provides a framework in which the quantum majority rule (QMR) constitution of Bao and Yunger Halpern [Phys. Rev. A 95, 062306 (2017)] violates the quantum analogue of Arrow's impossibility theorem. We evaluate this QMR constitution analytically on classical profile data and implement its final measurement stage as a quantum circuit, running on both noiseless simulators and noisy IBM quantum hardware to map how realistic noise deforms the resulting societal ranking distribution. Moderate-high single-qubit noise does not change the qualitative behavior of QMR, whereas strong noise shifts the distribution toward other dominant winners than the classical one. We quantify this behavior using winner-agreement rates, Condorcet-winner flip rates, and Jensen-Shannon divergence between societal ranking distributions. In a second, exploratory component, we demonstrate an explicitly entanglement-based variant of the QMR constitution that serves as a testbed for multi-voter quantum correlations under noise, which we refer to as the QMR2-inspired variant. There, GHZ-type and separable superpositions over opposite rankings have the same expectation values but respond very differently to noise. Taken together, these two components connect the abstract QMR constitution to concrete implementations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and highlight design considerations for future quantum voting protocols.

*Ridha Horchani*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new experimental framework distinguishes between environmental decoherence and wave-function collapse, offering a test for quantum linearity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the open question of the quantum-to-classical transition by distinguishing between environmental decoherence and intrinsic wave-function collapse mechanisms.

Method: A levitated optomechanical platform is proposed to generate controllable Schrodinger-cat states in a dielectric nanosphere. The framework includes gas collisions, black-body radiation, and photon-recoil noise, with the CSL model embedded for comparison.

Result: The framework provides a quantitative and experimentally grounded approach to discriminate between collapse-induced decoherence and environmental noise.

Conclusion: The study outlines a concrete experimental blueprint to test quantum linearity, potentially revealing new physics or setting stringent bounds on objective-collapse parameters.

Abstract: The transition from the quantum to the classical realm remains one of the most profound open questions in physics. While quantum theory predicts the existence of macroscopic superpositions, their apparent absence in the everyday world is attributed either to environmental decoherence or to an intrinsic mechanism for wave-function collapse. This work presents a quantitative and experimentally grounded framework for distinguishing these possibilities. We propose a levitated optomechanical platform capable of generating controllable Schrodinger-cat states in the center of mass motion of a dielectric nanosphere. A comprehensive master equation incorporates gas collisions, black-body radiation, and photon-recoil noise, establishing a calibrated environmental baseline. The Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model is embedded within the same framework, predicting a characteristic saturation of the decoherence rate with superposition size and a quadratic scaling with mass. A Bayesian inference protocol is outlined to discriminate collapse induced excess decoherence from environmental noise. Together these elements provide a concrete experimental blueprint for a decisive test of quantum linearity, either revealing new physics beyond standard quantum mechanics or setting the most stringent bounds to date on objective-collapse parameters.

TL;DR: A polynomial-time algorithm is developed to identify non-symmetrizable AVCs, with improved efficiency under jammer energy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of identifying non-symmetrizable AVCs, which are resistant to denial of service attacks, and to develop efficient algorithms for this purpose despite the problem's inherent computational complexity.

Method: The study involves analyzing the problem of data transmission under jamming, focusing on symmetrizable AVCs. It relaxes the symmetrizability formulation and introduces a polynomial-time algorithm to identify non-symmetrizable AVCs, with additional analysis under jammer energy constraints.

Result: The results include a polynomial-time algorithm for determining non-symmetrizability of AVCs and its improved efficiency when energy constraints are imposed on the jammer.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that by relaxing the symmetrizability formulation, a polynomial-time algorithm can determine if an AVC is non-symmetrizable, and energy constraints on the jammer further enhance the algorithm's efficiency in identifying non-symmetrizable AVCs.

Abstract: We study the problem of data transmission under the influence of a jammer, which is typical for wireless systems and commonly modeled as an arbitrarily varying channel (AVC) in information theory. AVC fulfilling a certain set of linear equations are called symmetrizable and are known to be prone to denial of service attacks. Recent work has shown that deciding if a given AVC is symmetrizable or not is a non-Turing computable problem. By relaxing the formulation of symmetrizability, we show the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm that determines whether a given AVC is non-symmetrizable, but displays a critical dependence on the number of jammer input states. We then show how imposing an energy constraint on the jammer allows the same algorithm to efficiently identify large classes of AVCs which are non-symmetrizable.

Motivation: To address scalability challenges in trapped-ion quantum computing by leveraging the advantages of shuttling and distributed architectures.

Method: Proposes a hybrid architecture combining physical qubit shuttling and distributed quantum computing, incorporating quantum error correction and pipelining strategies for parallelism.

Result: Achieves a significantly lower logical error rate (1.20×10⁻⁸ of Photonic DQC and 3.79×10⁻³ of QCCD) and 2.82 times faster logical clock speed than QCCD for a 256-bit ECDLP problem.

Conclusion: SDQC demonstrates superior performance in logical error rate and clock speed compared to existing methods, making it a promising scalable quantum computing architecture.

Abstract: We propose Shuttling-based Distributed Quantum Computing (SDQC), a hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of physical qubit shuttling and distributed quantum computing to enable scalable trapped-ion quantum computing. SDQC performs non-local quantum operations by distributing entangled ion qubits via deterministic shuttling, combining the high-fidelity and deterministic operations of shuttling-based architectures with the parallelism and pipelining advantages of distributed quantum computing. We present (1) a practical architecture incorporating quantum error correction (QEC), (2) pipelining strategies to exploit parallelism in entanglement distribution and measurement, and (3) a performance evaluation in terms of logical error rate and clock speed. For a 256-bit elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) instance, which requires 2,871 logical qubits at code distance 13, SDQC achieves a logical error rate which is $1.20^{+0.94}_{-0.45}\times10^{-8}$ of Photonic DQC error rate and $3.79^{+5.09}_{-2.84}\times10^{-3}$ of Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) error rate, while providing 2.82 times faster logical clock speed than QCCD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of quantum machine learning in photonic platforms, focusing on the role of quantum correlations in enhancing performance for time-series forecasting tasks.

Method: Implementation of a quantum reservoir computing protocol using a reconfigurable linear optical integrated photonic circuit, with information processed through modulated quantum reservoir states and measured via single-photon detectors.

Result: Two-photon indistinguishable input states significantly outperformed distinguishable ones in time-series forecasting, leveraging quantum correlations for higher-order nonlinear function approximation.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of quantum interference and indistinguishability as a resource in photonic quantum reservoir computing, demonstrating superior performance with indistinguishable states.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning algorithms have very recently attracted significant attention in photonic platforms. In particular, reconfigurable integrated photonic circuits offer a promising route, thanks to the possibility of implementing adaptive feedback loops, which is an essential ingredient for achieving the necessary nonlinear behavior characteristic of neural networks. Here, we implement a quantum reservoir computing protocol in which information is processed through a reconfigurable linear optical integrated photonic circuit and measured using single-photon detectors. We exploit a multiphoton-based setup for time-series forecasting tasks in a variety of scenarios, where the input signal is encoded in one of the circuit's optical phases, thus modulating the quantum reservoir state. The resulting output probabilities are used to set the feedback phases and, at the end of the computation, are fed to a classical digital layer trained via linear regression to perform predictions. We then focus on the investigation of the role of input photon indistinguishability in the reservoir's capabilities of predicting time-series. We experimentally demonstrate that two-photon indistinguishable input states lead to significantly better performance compared to distinguishable ones. This enhancement arises from the quantum correlations present in indistinguishable states, which enable the system to approximate higher-order nonlinear functions when using comparable physical resources, highlighting the importance of quantum interference and indistinguishability as a resource in photonic quantum reservoir computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage quantum computing's potential for solving combinatorial optimization problems more efficiently than classical methods, particularly the Minimum Vertex Cover problem, which has applications in network resilience and control.

Method: A heuristic quantum algorithm using continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) with dynamic decoupling and compact binary encoding to efficiently identify influential vertices.

Result: The algorithm achieves better approximation ratios and robustness across various graph types (Erdős-Rényi, Barabási-Albert, regular random graphs) compared to classical heuristics and MILP.

Conclusion: The CTQW-based heuristic demonstrates superior performance and robustness in solving the Minimum Vertex Cover problem, outperforming classical methods and showing potential for large-scale combinatorial optimization and complex network control applications.

Abstract: We propose a novel heuristic quantum algorithm for the Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem based on continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs). In this framework, the coherent propagation of a quantum walker over a graph encodes its structural properties into state amplitudes, enabling the identification of highly influential vertices through their transition probabilities. To enhance stability and solution quality, we introduce a dynamic decoupling (``freezing'') mechanism that isolates vertices already selected for the cover, preventing their interference in subsequent iterations of the algorithm. The method employs a compact binary encoding, requiring only $\lceil \log_2 (V)\rceil$ qubits to represent a graph with $V$ vertices, resulting in an exponential reduction of quantum resources compared to conventional vertex-based encodings. We benchmark the proposed heuristic against exact solutions obtained via Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and against established classical heuristics, including Simulated Annealing, FastVC, and the 2-Approximation algorithm, across Erdős--Rényi, Barabási--Albert and regular random graph ensembles. Our results demonstrate that the CTQW-based heuristic consistently achieves superior approximation ratios and exhibits remarkable robustness with respect to network topology, outperforming classical approaches in both heterogeneous and homogeneous structures. These findings indicate that continuous-time quantum walks, when combined with topology-independent decoupling strategies, provide a powerful paradigm for large-scale combinatorial optimization and complex network control, with potential applications spanning infrastructure resilience, epidemic containment, sensor network optimization, and biological systems analysis.

In recent work by the authors [23], a general framework was introduced for constructing Bell inequalities that self-test entire families of Clifford generators. In this manuscript, we develop an alternative and complementary self-testing criterion based on symmetric spanning sets. This formulation provides an explicit and constructive route to designing self-testing Bell inequalities in arbitrary dimensions.

Conclusion: The study establishes a tradeoff between the Hamiltonian's gap (indicating preparation hardness) and the quantum Fisher information of the corresponding ground state.

Abstract: Multipartite quantum states saturating the Heisenberg limit of sensitivity typically require full-body correlators to be prepared. On the other hand, experimentally practical Hamiltonians often involve few-body correlators only. Here, we study the metrological performances under this constraint, using tools derived from the quantum Fisher information. Our work applies to any encoding generator, also including a dependence on the parameter. We find that typical random symmetric ground states of $k$-body permutation-invariant Hamiltonians exhibit Heisenberg scaling. Finally, we establish a tradeoff between the Hamiltonian's gap, which quantifies preparation hardness, and the quantum Fisher information of the corresponding ground state.

Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for deterministic constructions that can exhibit chaotic behavior across diverse quantum hardware platforms.

Method: The study explores deterministic Clifford circuit architectures, including random Clifford circuits with causal cover, bitonic sorting networks, and permutation-based routing circuits, to analyze their behavior in terms of Wigner-Dyson entanglement spectrum statistics and OTOC decay.

Result: Experiments reveal that initializing with n T-states and adding a second T-layer after causally covered Clifford evolution yields consistent OTOC decay and Wigner-Dyson statistics, highlighting the sufficiency of causal connectivity for operator spreading.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates that causal connectivity is a critical feature for driving quantum circuits to chaos, showing that deterministic circuits with polylogarithmic depth can approximate chaotic behavior and generate Wigner-Dyson entanglement statistics and OTOC decay.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum chaos and unitary T-design behavior in derandomized Clifford+T circuits using causal cover architectures. Motivated by the need for deterministic constructions that can exhibit chaotic behavior across diverse quantum hardware platforms, we explore deterministic Clifford circuit architectures (random Clifford circuits with causal cover, bitonic sorting networks, and permutation-based routing circuits) to drive quantum circuits toward Wigner-Dyson (WD) entanglement spectrum statistics and OTOC decay.Our experiments demonstrate that causal connectivity, not circuit depth or randomness, is a critical feature that drives circuits to chaos. We show that initializing with n T-states and adding a second T-layer after a causally covered Clifford evolution yields consistent OTOC decay and WD statistics. This also enables deeper understanding of the circuit structures that generate complex entanglement behavior. Notably, our work suggests polylogarithmic-depth deterministic circuits suffice to approximate chaotic behavior, highlighting that causal connectivity is sufficient for operator spreading to induce Wigner-Dyson entanglement statistics and OTOC decay.

Motivation: The research is motivated by questions in quantum computing, aiming to understand the propagation of information in quantum circuits, particularly in the context of 2D Euclidean lattices.

Method: The study investigates graph-theoretic problems, specifically bounded extensions and bounded geodesic slices, to analyze the propagation of information in quantum circuits. It defines and uses the concepts of geodesic slices and geodesic directability.

Result: The key result is the proof that $	extbackslash mathbb{Z}^2$ is geodesically directable, along with the finding that any bounded extension of $	extbackslash mathbb{Z}^2$ and all two-dimensional regular tilings share this property.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that $	extbackslash mathbb{Z}^2$ and all two-dimensional regular tilings are geodesically directable, which provides a setting for designing exactly-solvable chaotic local quantum circuits with non-trivial correlation patterns.

Abstract: We investigate a graph-theoretic problem motivated by questions in quantum computing concerning the propagation of information in quantum circuits. A graph $G$ is said to be a bounded extension of its subgraph $L$ if they share the same vertex set, and the graph distance $d_L(u, v)$ is uniformly bounded for edges $uv\in G$. Given vertices $u, v$ in $G$ and an integer $k$, the geodesic slice $S(u, v, k)$ denotes the subset of vertices $w$ lying on a geodesic in $G$ between $u$ and $v$ with $d_G(u, w) = k$. We say that $G$ has bounded geodesic slices if $|S(u, v, k)|$ is uniformly bounded over all $u, v, k$. We call a graph $L$ geodesically directable if it has a bounded extension $G$ with bounded geodesic slices.
  Contrary to previous expectations, we prove that $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is geodesically directable. Physically, this provides a setting in which one could devise exactly-solvable chaotic local quantum circuits with non-trivial correlation patterns on 2D Euclidean lattices. In fact, we show that any bounded extension of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is geodesically directable. This further implies that all two-dimensional regular tilings are geodesically directable.

Abstract: We investigate the spin-1/2 $J_1-J_2$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a magnetic field by combining large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with self-consistent spin-wave theory. The resulting field-coupling phase diagram reveals that quantum fluctuations stabilize coplanar order across the entire parameter range, giving rise to a characteristic sequence of magnetization plateaux. Near the quantum-spin-liquid window $0.06 \lesssim J_2/J_1 \lesssim 0.14$, which extends to magnetic field $B \sim J_1$, we identify overlapping $m = 1/3$ and $m = 1/2$ plateaux - a distinctive hallmark of the system's proximity to the low-field spin-liquid regime. The excellent quantitative agreement between DMRG and self-consistent one-loop spin-wave calculations demonstrates that semiclassical approaches can reliably capture and parameterize the plateau phases of triangular quantum antiferromagnets.

Method: Development of a multiscale resistor network model incorporating the assumption of fractal sub-pixel structure of the optical data, based on the random field Ising model near criticality.

Result: The model accurately predicts the macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ throughout the temperature range of interest.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates an accurate prediction of the macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ using a multiscale resistor network model, revealing that the fractal, power law structure of metallic and insulating domains extends to smaller scales than previously observed.

Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) exhibits hysteresis in resistance while undergoing a thermally driven insulator-metal transition (IMT). Understanding the nonequilibrium effects in resistance is of great interest, as VO$_2$ is a strong candidate for brain-inspired computing, which is more energy efficient for AI tasks compared to traditional computing. Accurate models of the connection between microscopic and macroscopic transport properties and microscopic imaging of VO$_2$ will allow us to better utilize VO$_2$ in future applications. However, predictions of macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ that quantitatively match observations using spatially resolved data have not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate an accurate prediction of the macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ throughout the entire temperature range of interest, by developing a multiscale resistor network model incorporating the assumption of fractal sub-pixel structure of the optical data, where the configuration of insulating and metallic domains within each pixel are drawn from the random field Ising model near criticality. This strongly indicates that the observed fractal, power law structure of metallic and insulating domains extends down to much smaller length scales than the current record for experimental resolution of this system, and that the two-dimensional random field Ising model near criticality is a suitable model for describing the metal and insulator patches of VO$_2$ down to scales that approach the unit cell.

Abstract: The metallic kagome compound Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ has attracted attention as a candidate platform where geometric frustration and itinerant electrons may cooperate to stabilize a quantum-disordered magnetic ground state. Here, we combine bulk thermodynamic probes, low-noise FIB-device transport, and comprehensive $^{55}$Mn Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements to elucidate the low-temperature spin dynamics of this system. The bulk data reveal strongly reduced magnetic entropy, a negative magnetoresistance arising from spin scattering, and field-dependent transport indicates the spin fluctuations, while showing no signatures of long-range magnetic order. NMR provides a direct local view of the correlated Mn moments: the nuclear spin-spin relaxation $T_2$ exhibits a pronounced low-temperature enhancement driven by an indirect internuclear coupling through electronic spin fluctuations, whose temperature and distance dependence point to partially gapped low-energy spin excitations. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ displays a Hebel-Slichter-like coherence peak near \SI{10}{K}, coincident with the resistivity crossover and a subtle heat-capacity anomaly, indicating the formation of short-range spin-singlet correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ hosts an unconventional correlated state dominated by frustrated, gapped spin dynamics, placing it among the rare metallic kagome systems proximate to a quantum spin liquid.

Abstract: We present a novel pairing mechanism for superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems, which often have both localised and itinerant charge carriers. An effective anisotropic interaction between the itinerant particles originates from the fluctuations in the crystal field associated with virtual hopping of the localised particles, a process that is also responsible for the Kondo exchange. Interestingly, this interaction is \emph{attractive} for charge transfer insulators such as cuprates. Considering a simple toy model for cuprates, without the antiferromagnetic exchange, this interaction leads to the correct d-wave superconducting gap, thus demonstrating its relevance.

TL;DR: Derived sc-RPA from PTA, validates with 1D spinless fermion model, captures key ground state and spectral features, and discusses RPA challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize Rowe's zero-temperature formalism to arbitrary temperatures and provide a framework for extending sc-RPA, while validating the approach with a concrete model.

Method: Derivation of self-consistent RPA (sc-RPA) from projective truncation approximation (PTA) for two-time Green's function, applied to a 1D spinless fermion model with N-representability constraints.

Result: Ground state energy, correlation function, and density spectral function agree with existing results; Luttinger liquid ground state and spectral features are well captured.

Conclusion: The sc-RPA derived from PTA rationalizes Rowe's formalism and provides a framework for extension. Implementations in a 1D spinless fermion model show agreement with existing results, capturing key features of the ground state and spectral function, while highlighting challenges in RPA approximations.

Abstract: We derive the self-consistent random phase approximations (sc-RPA) from the projective truncation approximation (PTA) for the equation of motion of two-time Green's function. The obtained sc-RPA applies to arbitrary temperature and recovers the Rowe's formalism at zero temperature. The PTA formalism not only rationalize Rowe's formula, but also provides a general framework to extend sc-RPA. We implement the sc-RPA calculation for the one-dimensional spinless fermion model in the parameter regime of disordered ground state, with the N-representability constraints enforced. The obtained ground state energy, correlation function, and density spectral function agree well with existing results. The features of the Luttinger liquid ground state and the continuum/bound state in the spectral function are well captured. We discuss several issues concerning the approximations made in RPAs, difficulties of RPA for symmetric state, and the static component problem of PTA.

Motivation: To understand the role of excitons and their complexes in optical behaviors and electronic excitations in 2D semiconductors, and their implications for charge density wave formation and electronic state engineering.

Method: The research utilized angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to investigate light-matter interactions mediated by excitonic complexes in a monolayer of WSe2 under continuous incident light.

Result: Observation of quasi-steady excitons and their complexes, including ground and excited state excitons and trions, along with electronic excitation states characterized by VB mass renormalization, enhanced SOC, an excitonic gap near EF, and intervalley excitonic band folding.

Conclusion: The study reveals a quasi-steady excitonic complex background in 2D semiconductors, providing new insights into exciton-mediated CDW formation and potential applications in correlated electronic state engineering.

Abstract: Excitons and their complexes govern optical-related behaviors in semiconductors. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we have elucidated the light-matter interac- tion mediated by quasi-steady excitonic complexes within a monolayer of the prototypical two- dimensional (2D) semiconductor WSe2. Under continuous incident light, we have observed the generation of quasi-steady excitons and their complexes, encompassing ground and excited state excitons, trions, as well as their intricate interplay. We further show spectral evidence of elec- tronic excitation states within the background of quasi-steady excitonic complexes, characterized by valence band (VB) effective mass renormalization, the enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the formation of an excitonic gap near the Fermi level (EF ) of the conduction band (CB), and intervalley excitonic band folding. Our findings not only unveil a quasi-steady excitonic complex background for the creation of diverse electronic excitations in 2D semiconductors but also offer new insights into the role of excitons in the charge density wave (CDW) formation mechanism and facilitate the advancement of correlated electronic state engineering based on the coupling between electrons and excitonic complexes in a quasi-equilibrium state.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the intrinsic mechanisms behind noncoplanar spin states in perovskite ruthenates, which typically rely on extrinsic triggers.

Method: The research involves the study of (111) SrRuO3 epitaxial films, characterized by a topological Hall effect and noncoplanar spin arrangements.

Result: Discovery of an emergent chiral spin crystal phase, stabilized by dipolar interactions and magnetic frustration, enabling topological phases in thicker films.

Conclusion: The study opens a new pathway for creating and controlling topological spin states in perovskites, with broad implications for spintronic device design.

Abstract: Perovskite ruthenates are fascinating playgrounds for exploring topological spin textures, but generally rely on extrinsic mechanisms to trigger the noncoplanar states. Here we report the discovery of an emergent chiral spin crystal phase in (111) SrRuO3 epitaxial films, characterized by a significant topological Hall effect and noncoplanar spin arrangements with different propagation vectors along two orthogonal directions. Instead of driven by the enhanced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction due to broken inversion symmetry at heterointerfaces, this emergent state arises intrinsically from the interplay of dipolar interactions and magnetic frustration, leading to the stabilization of topological phases in much thicker films. These findings open a new pathway for creating and controlling the topological spin states in perovskites, with broad implications for spintronic device design.

TL;DR: This paper develops a framework for bulk Thouless pumps in quasi-periodic systems, linking topological drift to quasi-Brillouin zone geometry, with simulations confirming the theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the quasi-periodic extensions of quantized Thouless pumps, which are well-understood in periodic systems but less so in quasi-periodic ones.

Method: Development of a general quantitative paradigm for bulk Thouless pumps in quasi-periodic systems, focusing on emergent long wave-length effective potentials.

Result: A universal relation between topological drifting and quasi-Brillouin zone geometry, yielding a compact formula for calculating Chern numbers in periodic systems.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a universal relation between topological drifting and the geometry of quasi-Brillouin zones, validated by simulations in one- and two-dimensional quasi-periodic lattices.

Abstract: Quantized Thouless pumps in periodic systems, set by Chern numbers or Wannier-center winding, is by now fairly well established, whereas its quasi-periodic extensions still require further clarification. Here, we develop a general quantitative paradigm for bulk Thouless pumps in continuous models with spacetime quasi-periodicity, applicable to arbitrary spatial dimensions. Within this framework, the bulk pumping turns out to be governed by an emergent long wave-length effective potential. Based on this mechanism, we obtain our main result a universal relation between topological drifting and the geometry of quasi Brillouin zone. Reduced to periodic systems, our result gives an explicit and compact formula which enables us to directly calculate Chern numbers by microscopic data. These proposals are corroborated by simulations of one- and two-dimensional continuous moiré-type spacetime quasi-periodic lattices, which exhibit stable, localized, directional drift in excellent agreement with the theory.

TL;DR: Ultrafast spectroscopy in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ shows CDW amplitude mode hardening under photoexcitation, linked to screening of electron-phonon interactions, revealing a fragile competition between excitonic and lattice dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between ultrafast dynamical processes and characteristic temperatures ($T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T^*$), and to explore the behavior of CDW amplitude modes under photoexcitation.

Method: Ultrafast optical spectroscopy was employed to investigate the electronic and lattice dynamics of 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ across various temperatures and pump fluences.

Result: Two coherent phonon modes were identified, with the CDW amplitude mode exhibiting anomalous hardening under increased pump fluence. An abrupt increase in excited state buildup time above a critical fluence marks a transition to a photoinduced metastable metallic state.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the CDW order in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ is governed by a fragile, fluence-tunable competition between excitonic correlations and lattice dynamics.

Abstract: We use ultrafast optical spectroscopy to investigate the electronic and lattice dynamics of the charge-density wave (CDW) material 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ across various temperatures and pump fluences. We reveal a close relationship between the observed ultrafast dynamical processes and two characteristic temperatures: $T_{\rm CDW}$ ($\sim$202 K) and $T^*$ ($\sim$165 K). Two coherent phonon modes are identified: a high-frequency $A_{1g}$ mode ($ω_{1}$) and a lower-frequency $A_{1g}$ CDW amplitude mode ($ω_{2}$). In stark contrast to thermal melting, where phonons soften, the CDW amplitude mode exhibits anomalous hardening (frequency upshift) with increasing pump fluence. We establish this hardening as the direct signature of an ultrafast restoration of the bare lattice potential. The photoexcited carrier plasma screens the long-range electron-phonon interactions that drive the Peierls-like instability, effectively ``undressing" the soft phonon and driving its frequency toward the stiffer value of the unrenormalized lattice. Furthermore, an abrupt increase in the excited state buildup time above a critical pump fluence marks a sharp boundary to a photoinduced metastable metallic state. These findings demonstrate that the CDW order in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ is governed by a fragile, fluence-tunable competition between excitonic correlations and lattice dynamics.

Conclusion: 分析了在一维空间中限制的小型维格纳晶体中双电子系统的交换耦合现象。研究了电子间距与能量分裂的关系，并强调了次主导指数修正的重要性。提出了两种计算方法，验证了结果的正确性。

Abstract: We study the exchange coupling in small Wigner crystals confined to one-dimensional space. In particular we concentrate on the simplest nontrivial case of two electrons in a box potential and calculate analytically the energy splitting between the lowest spatially symmetric and antisymmetric states, which is a relevant energy scale for the magnetic properties of the system. In the approximation of a fixed center of mass coordinate, the splitting decays exponentially with the square root of the distance between the electrons at the leading order. We show that the subleading exponential correction significantly increases the splitting and thus becomes crucial in order to describe correctly the exact numerical data for system sizes that are not astronomically large. Two methods of calculation of the energy splitting are developed. The first is based on the analysis of the exact solution that can be expressed in terms of the Whittaker functions. It applies at all values of the short-distance cutoff played by the width of one-dimensional wire that regularizes the Coulomb potential. The second method is based on the quasiclassical (or Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation, which applies only for sufficiently large values of the cutoff. The two methods give identical result in the overlapping region. As a side result, our study gives the energy splitting in a triangular double well potential of inverse ``M'' shape.

Conclusion: 在倾斜Dirac锥材料中，通过控制倾斜速度的方向，可以实现对布里渊区内特定方向的热梯度调控，从而产生瞬态Seebeck效应。这一现象在超快传感器应用中具有潜在的新颖用途。

Abstract: We point out that in the tilted Dirac cone materials the non-equilibrium (hot) electron relaxation with phonons is anisotropic in the Brillouin zone. It means that there is a preferential heating of the lattice degrees of freedom in the specific directions of the Brillouin zone, in particular, in the direction opposite to the tilt velocity in the model considered by us. This observation will have novel consequences: (1) With pump-probe spectroscopy applied to a given tilted Dirac cone material an anisotropic relaxation would lead to a transient anisotropic heating which can further lead to a transient Seebeck effect as transient thermal gradients would exist in the specific directions of the BZ, and (2) this direction of anisotropic heating can be controlled by controlling the direction of the tilt velocity which can be externally tuned by the application of an external pressure. We foresee novel applications of this effect in ultrafast sensor applications involving transient heating effects. This is equivalent to inducing a transient Seebeck effect by just shinning light on a tilted Dirac cone material!

Motivation: Understanding the role of lattice degrees of freedom is essential to unravel the interplay between charge, orbital, and spin dynamics in nickelates, which exhibit various emergent phenomena.

Method: Temperature and polarization-dependent Raman scattering measurements were used to investigate phononic degrees of freedom in Pr4-xLaxNi3O10 nickelates.

Result: All systems studied undergo a metal-to-metal transition (TMMT) with intertwined spin and charge density waves. Phonon self-energy parameters show pronounced anomalies near TMMT, with some modes exhibiting dramatic changes in softening rates.

Conclusion: The study highlights the crucial role of lattice degrees of freedom in mediating correlated ground states in layered nickelates, emphasizing their sensitivity to spin and charge order.

Abstract: Lattice degrees of freedom (DoF) play a central role in correlated electron systems, strongly influencing the dynamics of the underlying charge carriers and spin excitations. In nickelates, understanding the role of lattice is essential to unravel the interplay between charge, orbital, and spin degree of freedom in giving rise to various emergent phenomena reported recently. Here, we investigate the phononic DoF in a series of trilayer nickelates, namely Pr4-xLaxNi3O10 (where x = 0, 0.4, 1, 2, 3.6, and 4) using temperature and polarization dependent Raman scattering measurements. Our in-depth analysis of the phonon evolution with temperature and doping, gives interesting insights into the behaviour of these materials. All these systems undergo a metal-to-metal transition (TMMT), characterized by the development of intertwined spin and charge density waves, with the spin density wave preceding the charge density wave. These transitions manifest as pronounced anomalies in phonon self-energy parameters i.e. peak frequency and linewidth in the vicinity of the metal-to-metal transition. Several phonon modes show dramatic change (nearly an order of magnitude for some modes) in their softening rates across the TMMT, highlighting the sensitivity of the lattice dynamics to spin and charge order. These findings emphasize the crucial role of lattice DoF in mediating correlated ground states in layered nickelates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the quantum phase transition and the nature of excitations at the deconfined quantum-critical point in the J-Q model.

Method: Quantum Monte Carlo and numerical analytic continuation methods were used to study the dynamic spin structure factor and single-hole spectral function.

Result: A broad continuum of spinon excitations was found, described by the fermionic π-flux state, and the single-hole spectral function indicated spin-charge separation.

Conclusion: The study reveals spin-charge separation and suggests the system will evolve into an extended holon metal phase at finite doping.

Abstract: Using quantum Monte Carlo and numerical analytic continuation methods, we study the dynamic spin structure factor and the single-hole spectral function of a two-dimensional quantum magnet ($J$-$Q$ model) at its quantum phase transition separating Néel antiferromagnetic and spontaneously dimerized ground states. At this putative deconfined quantum-critical point, we find a broad continuum of spinon excitations that can be accounted for by the fermionic $π$-flux state; a known mean-field model for deconfined quantum criticality. We find that the best description of the two-spinon continuum is with a version of the model with a $2\times 2$ unit cell, reflecting non-trivial mutual statistics of spinons and anti-spinons. The single-hole spectral function can be described by the same spinon dispersion relation and an independently propagating holon. Thus, the system exhibits spin-charge separation and will likely evolve into an extended holon metal phase at finite doping.

TL;DR: Ta2NiSe5 is confirmed as an excitonic insulator through microscopic evidence, showing the insulating gap's independence from structural distortion and its correlation with charge puddles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the controversy over the ground state of Ta2NiSe5 and determine whether it is an excitonic insulator (EI), given its potential for exotic quantum phenomena and optoelectronic applications.

Method: Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy were used to analyze the insulating phase in Ta2NiSe5, including observations at structural domain boundaries and localized charge puddles.

Result: The insulating gap persists despite the absence of structural distortion at domain boundaries, and charge puddles suppress the gap, aligning with the excitonic insulator model. The in-gap states' decay length matches the estimated exciton wavefunction size.

Conclusion: Ta2NiSe5 is identified as an excitonic insulator, supported by microscopic evidence showing the persistence of the insulating gap without structural distortion and the role of charge correlations.

Abstract: An excitonic insulator (EI) is a charge-neutral bosonic condensate of spontaneously formed electron-hole pairs. Exotic quantum phenomena such as dissipationless charge neutral transport and huge potential for optoelectronic applications have led to an extensive search for intrinsic bulk materials that are EIs at ambient pressure without sophisticated device fabrication. The narrow gap semimetal Ta2NiSe5 has been proposed as a rare example of an intrinsic EI, but its ground state has remained controversial since the EI phase transition is accompanied by a structural distortion. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to present microscopic evidence that supports an excitonic origin of the insulating phase in Ta2NiSe5. First, we find that the insulating gap persists at structural domain boundaries where the bulk structural distortion is absent suggesting that the structural distortion is not the primary origin of insulating ground state. Second, the insulating gap is suppressed at localized charge puddles which indicates that charge correlations are important in producing the insulating gap. Finally, the decay length of the in-gap states at the puddles shows similar value to the estimated size of the exciton wavefunction from previous photoemission studies. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ta2NiSe5 is an EI and may be a versatile platform to study the physics of bosonic condensates in solid-state system at ambient conditions.

Motivation: To establish information as the fundamental quantity underlying thermodynamic disorder and to bridge the gap between information theory and statistical mechanics.

Result: The method successfully reproduced benchmark entropies for various materials (metals, semiconductors, oxides, refractory ceramics) in solid and liquid phases.

Conclusion: The study unifies information theory and statistical mechanics by demonstrating the quantitative equivalence between Shannon's information entropy and thermodynamic entropy, providing a computationally efficient framework for determining entropies and free energies from atomic data.

Abstract: We demonstrate that Shannon's information entropy and the thermodynamic entropy of Boltzmann and Gibbs are quantitatively equivalent for real condensed-matter systems. By interpreting atomic configurations as information sources, we compute entropy directly from the compressibility of molecular-dynamics trajectories, without physical partitioning or empirical modeling. A custom lossy-compression algorithm measures the minimum number of bits required to describe a microstate at finite precision, and this bit count maps exactly to thermodynamic entropy through the Shannon-Boltzmann relation. The method reproduces benchmark entropies for metals, semiconductors, oxides, and refractory ceramics in both solid and liquid phases, establishing information as the fundamental quantity underlying thermodynamic disorder. This equivalence unifies information theory and statistical mechanics, providing a general and computationally efficient framework for determining entropies and free energies directly from atomic data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to distinguish the pcDP model from ordinary directed percolation (DP) by studying its unique properties, such as particle number conservation modulo 2 and the behavior of critical exponents.

Method: The method involves high statistics simulations to investigate the critical exponents and scaling behaviors in the pcDP model.

Result: The results indicate that some critical exponents in pcDP, like β, are very close to simple rational numbers (e.g., β = 1.000), and highlight distinct scaling behaviors in systems with even and odd particle numbers.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that high statistics simulations clarify the critical exponent values in the parity conserving directed percolation (pcDP) model, particularly confirming β = 1.000 with high precision.

Abstract: Next to the directed percolation (DP) universality class, parity conserving directed percolation (pcDP; also called parity
  conserving branching annihilating random walks, pcBARW) is the second-most important model with an absorbing state
  transition. Its distinction from ordinary DP is that particle number is conserved modulo 2, which means in 1 dimension of
  space that there are two degenerate vacuum (absorbing) states. Particles can be interpreted as domain walls between
  them, and there are two distinct sectors in systems with a finite initial number of particles: Realizations with even and
  odd particle numbers show different scaling behaviors. An intriguing feature of pcDP it is that some of its critical
  exponents seem to be very simple rational numbers. The most prominent is the one describing the average number of
  particles (or active sites) in the even sector, which is asymptotically constant. In contrast, the dynamical critical
  exponent (which is the same in both sectors) seems not close to any simple rational. Finally, the order parameter exponent
  (which is also the same in both sectors) is, according to the most precise previous simulations, $β= 1.020(5)$,
  and thus very close but not really compatible with a simple rational. We present high statistics simulations which
  clarifies this situation, and which indicate several other intriguing properties of pcPD clusters. In particular, we find
  $β= 1.000$ with the error in the next digit.

Motivation: The motivation is to establish a natural formulation of thermodynamics based on the intrinsic geometry of phase space, eliminating the need to postulate an ensemble, which instead emerges from the geometric structure itself.

Method: The paper employs a geometric formulation of thermodynamics, using curvature invariants to derive entropy and its derivatives. It validates the method by analyzing the 1D XY mean-field model and 2D φ4 theory.

Result: The results show that geometric transformations in energy-manifold structure drive thermodynamic responses and characterize criticality. The framework successfully applies to paradigmatic systems and long-range interacting systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that thermodynamics can be formulated purely from the intrinsic geometry of phase space, with phase transitions encoded in the geometry of constant-energy manifolds. The framework is validated through analysis of specific models and applies universally to long-range interacting systems.

Abstract: We show that thermodynamics can be formulated naturally from the intrinsic geometry of phase space alone-without postulating an ensemble, which instead emerges from the geometric structure itself. Within this formulation, phase transitions are encoded in the geometry of constant-energy manifold: entropy and its derivatives follow from a deterministic equation whose source is built from curvature invariants. As energy increases, geometric transformations in energy-manifold structure drive thermodynamic responses and characterize criticality. We validate this framework through explicit analysis of paradigmatic systems-the 1D XY mean-field model and 2D $φ^4$ theory-showing that geometric transformations in energy-manifold structure characterize criticality quantitatively. The framework applies universally to long-range interacting systems and in ensemble-inequivalence regimes.

TL;DR: Study shows asymmetric boundaries and individualistic behavior affect mean first passage time in the noisy voter model, with analytical results matching simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of asymmetric boundary conditions and individualistic actions on the mean first passage time in the symmetric noisy voter model, addressing gaps in traditional models.

Method: Derived exact analytical expressions for mean first passage time under different boundary configurations (both absorbing, and one absorbing and one reflective) and validated with numerical simulations.

Result: Mean first passage time exhibits asymmetry based on boundary placement and initial conditions, with symmetry only when boundaries are equidistant. Kramers' law holds under large independent transition rates.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that asymmetric boundary conditions and individualistic behavior significantly influence the mean first passage time in the noisy voter model. Analytical results align with simulations, confirming the robustness of the findings.

Abstract: Models of imitation and herding behavior often underestimate the role of individualistic actions and assume symmetric boundary conditions. However, real-world systems (e.g., electoral processes) frequently involve asymmetric boundaries. In this study, we explore how arbitrarily placed boundary conditions influence the mean first passage time in the symmetric noisy voter model, and how individualistic behavior amplifies this asymmetry. We derive exact analytical expressions for mean first passage time that accommodate any initial condition and two types of boundary configurations: (i) both boundaries absorbing, and (ii) one absorbing and one reflective. In both scenarios, mean first passage time exhibits a clear asymmetry with respect to the initial condition, shaped by the boundary placement and the rate of independent transitions. Symmetry in mean first passage time emerges only when absorbing boundaries are equidistant from the midpoint. Additionally, we show that Kramers' law holds in both configurations when the rate of independent transitions is large. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, reinforcing the robustness of our findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the equivalence between the Heider model and the Ising model, particularly how structural balance in social systems can be mapped to physical spin systems.

Method: The authors demonstrate the equivalence explicitly for a complete graph and generalize the argument for arbitrary graphs, analyzing the signs of Heider relations in terms of Ising spin products.

Result: The result shows that the system of balanced Heider states undergoes a phase transition at a critical value of the social field, analogous to the Ising model.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the Heider model with an external field, in the limit of structural balance, is equivalent to the Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions, inheriting its phase transition characteristics.

Abstract: We show that the Heider model with an external field is equivalent, in the limit of structural balance, to the Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions without an external field. More precisely, we claim that the signs of the Heider relations that maintain structural equilibrium in the system can be represented as nearest neighbor Ising spin products. We demonstrate this explicitly for a complete graph and provide a general argument for an arbitrary graph. A consequence of the equivalence is that the system of balanced Heider states undergoes a phase transition, inherited from the Ising model, at a critical value of the social field at which the fluctuations of edge magnetization are maximal.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (TUR) by incorporating the statistics of recurrences, aiming for a tighter bound far from equilibrium.

Method: Transition-based formalism to express the long-time precision of an integrated current in terms of recurrence times and effective affinity.

Result: A general lower bound for the stationary entropy production rate that improves upon the standard TUR.

Conclusion: The augmented TUR, incorporating recurrence statistics, is tighter than the standard TUR far from equilibrium, offering new opportunities for optimizing and designing nonequilibrium biological and chemical systems at the nanoscale.

Abstract: For continuous-time Markov jump processes on irreducible networks and time-independent rate constants, we employ a transition-based formalism to express the long-time precision of a single integrated current over an observable channel in terms of precisions of the recurrence times of the forward and backward jumps, and of an effective affinity that captures the thermodynamic driving on that channel. This leads to a general lower bound for the stationary entropy production rate that extends the well-known Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (TUR). Such an augmented TUR, which incorporates the statistics of the recurrences, proves to be tighter than the standard one far from equilibrium, and potentially offers new opportunities for the optimization and design of biological and chemical out-of-equilibrium systems at the nanoscale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子Mpemba效应时，全量子态的测量在系统规模增大时变得非常困难，因此需要一种更简单的方法。

Method: 通过测量已知初始态的可观测量来检测量子Mpemba效应的发生。

Result: 提出了用可观测量代替全态测量的方法，成功检测到量子Mpemba效应。

Conclusion: 该方法通过识别适当的可观测量来检测量子Mpemba效应，显著降低了实验复杂性，并为在复杂多比特系统中观察该效应提供了实用途径。

Abstract: The Mpemba effect refers to the anomalous relaxation of a quantum state that, despite being initially farther from equilibrium, relaxes faster than a closer counterpart. Detecting such a quantum Mpemba effect typically requires full knowledge of the quantum state during its time evolution, which is an experimentally challenging task since state tomography becomes exponentially difficult as system size increases. This poses a significant obstacle in studying Mpemba effect in complex many-body systems. In this work, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by identifying suitable observables that signal rapid relaxation. Moreover, as long as the system equilibrates to a known unique steady-state, it is possible to fully detect the occurrence of quantum Mpemba effect just by measuring the observable for known state preparations. Our approach thus significantly reduces experimental complexity and offers a practical route for observing the quantum Mpemba effect in complex and extended multi-qubit setups.

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: Study of the 1D three-state Potts model with mean-field interaction reveals a complex phase diagram with first-order transitions, triple points, and a critical point, derived analytically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the phase diagram of the one-dimensional three-state Potts model with an additional mean-field interaction in the canonical ensemble.

Method: The free energy is derived by mapping the model onto the spin-1 Blume-Emery-Griffiths model and solving it using a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation combined with the transfer matrix method.

Result: The phase diagram is two-dimensional with adjustable parameters K and T, featuring first-order transitions, triple points, and a critical point. The first-order transition temperature becomes asymptotically independent of K for large negative values.

Conclusion: The phase diagram of the model shows a complex structure with first-order transition lines, triple points, and a critical point. The absence of second-order transitions is due to the nature of the order parameter, and analytical results are obtained for one of the first-order transition lines.

Abstract: We derive the phase diagram of the one-dimensional three-state Potts model with an additional mean-field interaction in the canonical ensemble. The free energy is obtained by mapping the model onto the spin-$1$ Blume-Emery-Griffiths model and solving it by using an Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation combined with the transfer matrix method. A complex structure with lines of first-order transitions, two triple points and a critical point appears at finite temperature. The phase diagram is two-dimensional, since there are two adjustable parameters, the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ and the temperature $T$. We show that the phase diagram does not present second-order phase transition lines, due to the fact that the order parameter is not a symmetry-breaking one. Quite remarkably, we are able to determine analytically one of the first-order phase-transition lines. We also prove that, when the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ is large and negative, the first-order transition temperature becomes asymptotically independent of $K$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the elusive universality of phase transitions in percolation, Ising, and O(n) models when long-range interactions are introduced.

Method: Builds upon insights from Lévy flight to propose universality diagrams for percolation, O(n), and Fortuin-Kasteleyn Ising models in the (d,σ) plane.

Result: Conjectured universality diagrams consistent with high-precision numerical studies and rigorous mathematical results.

Conclusion: The proposed universality diagrams provide a unified perspective on critical phenomena in systems with long-range interactions, aligning with recent numerical studies and mathematical results.

Abstract: The percolation, Ising, and O($n$) models constitute fundamental systems in statistical and condensed matter physics. For short-range-interacting cases, the nature of their phase transitions is well established by renormalization-group theory. However, the universality of the transitions in these models remains elusive when algebraically decaying long-range interactions $\sim 1/r^{d+σ}$ are introduced, where $d$ is the dimensionality and $σ$ is the decay exponent. Building upon insights from Lévy flight, i.e., long-range simple random walk, we propose three universality diagrams in the $(d,σ)$ plane for the percolation model, the O($n$) model, and the Fortuin-Kasteleyn Ising model, respectively. The conjectured universality diagrams are consistent with recent high-precision numerical studies and rigorous mathematical results, offering a unified perspective on critical phenomena in systems with long-range interactions.

Motivation: To address the demand for efficient, energy-saving methods of spin manipulation at the molecular scale for spintronic and quantum computing devices.

Method: The study employed effective Hamiltonian calculations and density functional theory, informed by magnetic measurements.

Result: The magnetoelectric effect in the studied molecules is induced by the relocation of itinerant electrons, is highly anisotropic, depends on the valence state, and can be detected even at room temperature.

Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the potential of polyoxovanadate molecular magnets for practical applications requiring electric field control over spin states.

Abstract: Development of spintronic and quantum computing devices increases demand for efficient, energy saving method of spin manipulation at molecular scale. Polyoxovanadate molecular magnets being susceptible to both electric and magnetic fields may serve here as a good base material. In this paper two isostructural anions [V$_{12}$As$_8$O$_{40}$(HCO$_2$)]$^{n-}$ (with $n=3,5$) featuring two different mixed-valence states with itinerant and localized valence electrons are studied. The impact of the electric field on their magnetic properties is investigated by means of two complementary methods informed by magnetic measurements: effective Hamiltonian calculations and density functional theory. It is demonstrated that the magnetoelectric effect in theses molecules is induced mostly by relocation of itinerant electrons, is highly anisotropic, depends on the valence state and can be detected even at room temperature. These findings can pave the way to practical applications in which an electric field control over spin state is required.

TL;DR: Derived a chemical potential for magnon-polarons in FMs and AFMs, showing unified transport behavior under a single chemical potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously define the chemical potential for magnon-polaron quasiparticles in collinear ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, and to understand how magnetoelastic scattering equilibrates magnons and acoustic phonons.

Method: The study uses a rotationally invariant formulation of spin-lattice coupling and focuses on high-symmetry crystals to derive the chemical potential. It includes microscopic thermodynamic analysis and Boltzmann transport theory.

Result: In both FM and AFM systems, the nonequilibrium magnon-polaron gas is governed by a single chemical potential. The hybrid branches in FMs and chiral sectors in AFMs show distinct coupling behaviors.

Conclusion: The research provides a rigorous definition of the chemical potential for magnon-polaron quasiparticles in collinear ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, demonstrating that the nonequilibrium magnon-polaron gas is governed by a single chemical potential conjugate to the conserved axial angular momentum. The findings support a unified transport theory for magnon-polarons.

Abstract: Using a rotationally invariant formulation of spin-lattice coupling, we derive a rigorous definition of the chemical potential for magnon-polaron quasiparticles in collinear ferromagnets (FMs) and antiferromagnets (AFMs), valid when magnetoelastic scattering equilibrates magnons and acoustic phonons on timescales much shorter than those associated with quasiparticle-nonconserving relaxation processes. While our microscopic framework applies to generic magnon-phonon interactions, here we focus on high-symmetry crystals where the two transverse acoustic modes form a degenerate doublet. This doublet can combine into circularly polarized phonons, making the chiral selectivity of the coupling manifest: the FM magnon mode hybridizes only with the co-rotating phonon, whereas in collinear AFMs each magnon branch of opposite handedness couples to the phonon of the same chirality. We show that, in both FM and AFM systems, the nonequilibrium magnon-polaron gas is governed by a single chemical potential conjugate to the conserved axial angular momentum. In FMs, the two hybrid branches in the co-rotating sector share this chemical potential, weighted by their magnonic fractions; in AFMs, the four magnon-polaron branches split into two chiral sectors that carry opposite angular momenta and couple with opposite sign to the same chemical potential. Building on this microscopic thermodynamic framework, we formulate a Boltzmann transport theory for magnon-polarons and derive compact expressions for angular-momentum and heat currents that interpolate continuously to the decoupled regime and reproduce the phenomenological magnon-polaron transport framework underlying previous spin Seebeck analyses.

Motivation: To address the challenge of RF charge detection in high-resistance 2D material quantum dot devices, essential for qubits readout.

Method: RF reflectometry with impedance matching was demonstrated using a tunable SrTiO3 varactor integrated into a resonant circuit, achieving nearly perfect impedance matching.

Result: The demodulated RF signal clearly shows Coulomb oscillations, with the SrTiO3 varactor demonstrating robustness against magnetic fields and voltage noise.

Conclusion: The study establishes SrTiO3 varactors as effective tunable matching components for RF reflectometry in high-resistance 2D material quantum devices, laying the groundwork for high-speed qubits readout.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are attractive platforms for realizing high-performance quantum bits (qubits). However, radio-frequency (RF) charge detection, which is a key technique for qubits readout, remains challenging in such systems. We demonstrate RF reflectometry with impedance matching for high-resistance quantum dot devices based on bilayer graphene and molybdenum disulfide. By integrating a tunable strontium titanate (SrTiO3) varactor into a resonant circuit, we achieve nearly perfect impedance matching, enabling sensitive charge detection. The demodulated RF signal clearly shows Coulomb oscillations, and the SrTiO3 varactor exhibits robustness against both magnetic fields and voltage noise on the varactor. Our results establish SrTiO3 varactors as effective tunable matching components for RF reflectometry in high-resistance 2D material quantum devices, providing a foundation for high-speed qubits readout.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper develops a theory using local bosons (LBs) for thermal transport in FPU-β lattice, finding anharmonic interactions non-monotonically influence conductivity via competing LB trapping and production effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of anharmonic interactions in thermal transport within the FPU-β lattice by modeling it through local bosons (LBs) and stochastic dynamics.

Method: The theory introduces LBs as transport carriers, described by stochastic differential equations (SDEs) incorporating anharmonic interactions via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. Steady-state solutions of the SDEs are used to analyze thermal transport.

Result: Anharmonic interactions affect thermal transport in two competing ways: reducing current by trapping LBs and increasing it by enhancing LB production, leading to non-monotonic thermal conductivity. Finite size effects are also observed.

Conclusion: The study presents a theory where local bosons (LBs) serve as carriers for thermal transport in the FPU-β lattice, revealing a non-monotonic dependence of thermal conductivity on anharmonic interactions due to competing mechanisms of LB trapping and enhanced LB production. The theory also captures finite size effects.

Abstract: We present an open quantum theory for the thermal transport in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-$β$(FPU-$β$) lattice. In the theory, local bosons(LBs) are introduced as carriers for the transport. The LBs are stimulated by individual atoms in the lattice, which are different from the phonons that are collective motions of the atoms. The LBs move in the FPU chain and are governed by a set of stochastic differential equations(SDEs). The anharmonic interaction between the atoms in the lattice is transformed to a random field by the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, and has been implemented in the set of SDEs. By solving the set of SDEs at the steady state, we study the influence of the anharmonic interaction on the thermal transport. Results show that the anharmonic interaction decreases the thermal current by trapping the LBs on the lattice sites, as well as increase the thermal current by enhancing the amount of the LBs for the transport. The competition between these two mechanisms makes the thermal conductivity of the lattice dependent on the anharmonic interaction non-monotonically. The finite size effect of the thermal conductivity has also been captured by the theory.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Majorana bound states (MBSs) are key candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation, but their unambiguous identification in solid-state systems remains a challenge.

Method: Theoretical study using the master equation approach to investigate steady-state and transient dynamics in a capacitively coupled double quantum dot system.

Result: Discovery of a distinctive signature of MBSs: pronounced symmetric split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. The dynamics of quantum coherence show an inverse correlation with the emergence of these peaks.

Conclusion: The study establishes clear experimental criteria for distinguishing Majorana bound states (MBSs) from Andreev bound states (ABSs) and provides a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport.

Abstract: Majorana bound states (MBSs), with their non-Abelian statistics and topological protection, are key candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, their unambiguous identification in solid-state systems remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a theoretical study demonstrating that drag transport in a capacitively coupled double quantum dot system offers a robust and nonlocal probe of weakly coupled MBSs. Using the master equation approach, we investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics and uncover a distinctive signature of MBSs, i.e., the emergence of pronounced split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. We further show that the dynamics of quantum coherence exhibit an inverse correlation with the emergence and enhancement of MBS-induced split peaks in the drag transconductance as the inter-MBS coupling increases. A comparative analysis with Andreev bound states (ABSs) reveals key differences, that is, MBS-induced transconductance peaks are symmetric and robust, while ABS features are asymmetric and sensitive to perturbations. These findings establish clear experimental criteria for distinguishing MBSs and provide a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport.

*Maitri Ganguli,Diptiman Sen*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper investigates how periodic, quasiperiodic, and random driving protocols affect end modes and Loschmidt echo in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, revealing distinct dynamical behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the impact of different driving protocols (periodic, quasiperiodic, random) on topological properties and dynamical responses in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, particularly the relationship between end modes and winding numbers.

Method: Analyzing the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model driven by two unitary operators $U_1$ and $U_2$ under periodic, quasiperiodic, and random protocols, with focus on end modes and Loschmidt echo dynamics.

Result: End modes appear under periodic driving but may not align with the winding number. The Loschmidt echo exhibits oscillations with peaks at quasienergy gaps. For quasiperiodic driving, the LE oscillates before decaying, scaling with $ε^2$, while random driving causes rapid decay.

Conclusion: The study highlights the nuanced behavior of end modes and Loschmidt echo in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model under different driving protocols, providing insights into topological invariants and dynamical responses.

Abstract: We study the effect of driving the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using two unitary operators $U_1$ and $U_2$ in different combinations; the unitaries differ in the values of the inter-cell hopping amplitudes. Specifically, we study the cases where the unitaries are applied periodically, quasiperiodically and randomly. For a periodic protocol, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied alternately, we find that end modes may appear, but the number of end modes does not always agree with the winding number which is a $Z$-valued topological invariant. We then study the Loschmidt echo ($LE$) starting with a random initial state. We find that the $LE$ exhibits pronounced oscillations whose Fourier transform has peaks at frequencies which agree with the most prominent gaps between pairs of quasienergies. Next, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a quasiperiodic way (we consider Fibonacci and Thue-Morse protocols), we study the $LE$ starting with an initial state which is an end mode of one of the unitaries. When the inter-cell hoppings differ by a small amount denoted by $ε$, and the time period $T$ of each unitary is also small, the distance between the unitaries is found to be proportional to $εT$. We then find that the $LE$ oscillates around a particular value for a very long time before decaying to zero. The deviation of the value of the $LE$ from 1 scales as $ε^2$ for a fixed value of $T$, while the time after which the $LE$ starts decaying to zero has an interesting dependence on $ε$ and $T$. Finally, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a random order, the $LE$ rapidly decays to zero with increasing time. We have presented a qualitative understanding of the above results.

Conclusion: 实验证实了ML-G/ML-WSe₂/hBN异质结构中SOC与扭转角的强依赖性，并通过机械压力调节SOC强度。

Abstract: Recently, proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has been observed in heterostructures consisting of monolayer graphene (ML-G) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as WSe$_{2}$. Successful tuning of SOC in graphene/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures by applying mechanical pressure and electric fields was also demonstrated in previous studies. In addition, theoretical calculations predicted a strong dependence of the proximity-induced SOC on the twist angle between graphene and TMDC. Here, we put these predictions to experimental test in ML-G/ML-WSe$_{2}$/hBN-heterostructures, where the twist angle is determined by aligning fractured edges, and by crystallographic etching of graphene. By performing weak anti-localization measurements, we determine the strength of the Rasbha-type SOC ($λ_\mathrm{R}$) and the valley-Zeeman-type SOC ($λ_\mathrm{VZ}$). Our experiments confirm a strong twist angle dependence of the proximity-induced SOC in agreement with theoretical predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the tunability of the SOC strength via mechanical pressure, which is in agreement with earlier findings.

Method: Pioneering the use of fast-scanning tunnelling microscope (FSTM) techniques to investigate the internal dynamics of mesoscopic metastable topologically non-trivial defects in an electronic Wigner crystal superlattice.

Result: Unprecedented individual electron motion trajectories were recorded in real-time on the millisecond timescale, revealing dynamics arising from coupling of hybridised Goldstone-Higgs bound states with microscopic electronic degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: The study fundamentally transforms our understanding of metastable quantum states in electronic crystals and paves the way for technological advancements using engineered topologically non-trivial defects.

Abstract: Nonequilibrium self-assembly is the root of all emergent complexity, including life. In quantum materials emergent metastable states have become a very fashionable topic of research, but the study of resulting mesoscopic state dynamics is hindered by the absence of appropriate methods. Here we pioneer the use of fast-scanning tunnelling microscope (FSTM) techniques to investigate the internal dynamics of mesoscopic metastable topologically non-trivial defects in an electronic Wigner crystal superlattice created by a local electromagnetic perturbation. This allows us to record unprecedented individual electron motion trajectories in real-time on the millisecond timescale. Such dynamics is understood to arise from coupling of hybridised Goldstone-Higgs bound states localised at the Y junction with microscopic electronic degrees of freedom that lead to the formation of localised quasiparticles with slow internal dynamics. Their unprecedented robustness against external perturbations comes from non-local constraints and non-trivial broken symmetries. Two-level system telegraph noise maps at the junction show phase and amplitude that is correlated with the observed electron motion trajectories. Such observation of single-particle dynamics in real time fundamentally transforms our understanding of metastable quantum states in electronic crystals and paves the way for technological advancements that make use of engineered topologically non-trivial defects.

Motivation: The study aims to understand the emergence of topological phases in moiré bilayers and the role of interactions in mediating topological states without relying on single-particle hopping. It also explores the potential to manipulate these states using external fields.

Method: The researchers analyze the topological phases in a moiré MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ bilayer, with a focus on spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interactions. They use theoretical frameworks to explore the formation of Quantum Valley Hall Insulating (QVHI) and Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulating (QAHI) states, as well as the competition between $s$-wave and $p\pm ip$-wave symmetries.

Result: The research uncovers a robust QVHI phase and shows that long-range interactions alone can generate topologically nontrivial bands. It also identifies a competition between $s$-wave and $p\pm ip$-wave symmetries and demonstrates that a small Zeeman field can induce a QAHI state in one valley.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the emergence of robust topological phases in a moiré MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ bilayer, highlighting the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interactions. It reveals how long-range interactions can mediate interlayer electron tunneling, leading to topologically nontrivial bands even without single-particle hopping. Furthermore, the introduction of a small Zeeman field can induce a Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulating state in one valley.

Abstract: We explore the emergence of topological phases in moiré MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ bilayer, highlighting the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interactions at two holes per moiré unit cell $v = 2$. Our analysis uncovers robust Quantum Valley Hall Insulating (QVHI) phase and reveals that long-range interactions alone can mediate the interlayer electron tunneling, generating topologically nontrivial bands even in the absence of the corresponding single-particle hopping. Additionally, we show that in the case of band mixing terms originating both from the interaction and single particle physics a competition between topological states realizing $s$-$wave$ and $p\pm ip$-$wave$ symmetries can appear. Moreover, within the considered theoretical framework, we present that by introducing a small Zeeman field, one can lift the band inversion in one of the valleys. This leads to a Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulating (QAHI) state with the topological gap opening in a single valley and the other being topologically trivial.

Conclusion: The extended kagome lattices provide a versatile platform for achieving robust topological edge and corner modes with more degrees of freedom, enabling unique phenomena like multiple corner states and tunable pseudospin Hall effects. These findings are feasible in artificial classical systems like photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.

Abstract: Topological phases and modes, including pseudospin-Hall-selective edge transport and corner states, provide robust control of wave propagation and modal confinement in classical wave platforms. Under a tight-binding framework, we theoretically investigate two lattice designs derived from the kagome lattice. These extended kagome lattices support a series of localized modes, including pseudospin-Hall-like topological edge states and corner modes in different bandgaps and frequencies, which were not only achieved under lower lattice symmetries than Wu-Hu lattices, but also enable more degrees of freedom in topological and localized modes. By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of unavoidable 50% photon loss in vertical emission systems by optimizing polarization efficiency for single-photon sources in quantum computing.

Method: Theoretical study of the quantum dynamics of an exciton embedded in an asymmetric vertical cavity, focusing on polarized emission and Purcell-enhanced emission rates.

Result: Identification of the optimal configuration for state initialization and a demonstration of near-unity polarized efficiency, supported by analytical formulas for photon output.

Conclusion: The study identifies optimal configurations for exciton state initialization and demonstrates a path toward achieving near-unity polarized efficiency, providing insights into the physical mechanisms via analytical formulas for photon output.

Abstract: Single-photon sources based on neutral or charged excitons in a semiconductor quantum dot are attractive resources for photonic quantum computers and simulators. To obtain indistinguishable photons, the source is pumped on resonance with polarized laser pulses, and the output is collected in orthogonal polarization. However, for sources featuring vertical emission of light, 50% of the emitted photons are unavoidably lost in this way. Here, we theoretically study the quantum dynamics of an exciton embedded in an asymmetric vertical cavity that favors emission in a specific polarization. We identify the configuration for optimal state initialization and demonstrate a path toward near-unity polarized efficiency. We also derive simple analytical formulas for the photon output in each polarization as a function of the Purcell-enhanced emission rates, which shed light on the physical mechanism behind our results.

Motivation: Understanding the transient dynamics of magnetic skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets under external stimuli like magnetic field gradients is crucial for potential applications in spintronics and memory devices.

Method: The research combines numerical and analytical approaches to study the transient dynamics of skyrmions in a bilayer antiferromagnetic system. A moduli space dynamics approximation is used to explain the observed phenomena, supplemented by an exact treatment of the dynamics.

Result: Skyrmions move almost perpendicular to the field gradient and halt at a distance proportional to the gradient. Below a critical gradient, skyrmions return to their original positions when the gradient is removed ('remembering' dynamics). The displacement is proportional to the gradient, while the time to reach the final position is gradient-independent.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that magnetic skyrmion dynamics in synthetic antiferromagnets under a field gradient can exhibit remembering behavior, where skyrmions return to their original positions when the gradient is removed. The moduli space dynamics approximation accurately explains this behavior, though exact dynamics may show deviations.

Abstract: We numerically and analytically study the transient dynamics of magnetic skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets under a magnetic field gradient. We consider skyrmions in a bilayer with antiferromagnetic coupling between the layers. The skyrmions in the two layers move almost perpendicular to the field gradient and the motion is eventually halted with the two skyrmions at a distance from each other. We find that the skyrmion displacement is proportional to the field gradient, while the time it takes to reach their final position is almost independent of it. Below a critical magnetic field gradient strength, the system displays an unusual 'remembering' dynamics: when the magnetic field gradient is removed, the skyrmions return to their original positions to a high degree of accuracy. We explain this observation and other quantitative features using a moduli space dynamics approxi- mation. We further provide an exact treatment of the dynamics that indicates that deviations from exact memory of the skyrmion position can arise.

Motivation: To leverage the unique properties of acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs) for achieving tunable, giant Purcell enhancements for quantum emitters, addressing the need for efficient and controllable quantum light sources.

Method: Finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations were used to analyze the Purcell enhancement factors and quantum efficiencies for various quantum emitters in a graphene-metallic nanocube cavity filled with a dielectric.

Result: Giant Purcell enhancement factors of up to 6 orders of magnitude in the mid-IR and 4 orders at telecommunications wavelengths, with quantum efficiencies of 95% and 89%, respectively. Single-photon, entangled-photon, and multipolar transitions also showed significant enhancements.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry leveraging AGPs achieves significant Purcell enhancements across various quantum emitter transitions, with high quantum efficiencies and tunability via electrostatic gating. This has potential applications in quantum communication and information processing.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable ability of plasmons to boost radiative emission rates, we propose leveraging acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs) to realize tunable, giant Purcell enhancements for single-photon, entangled-photon, and multipolar quantum emitters. These AGPs are localized inside a cavity defined by a graphene sheet and a metallic nanocube and filled with a dielectric of thickness of a few nanometers and consisting of stacked layers of 2D materials, containing impurities or defects that act as quantum light emitters. Through finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, we show that this geometry can achieve giant Purcell enhancement factors over a large portion of the infrared (IR) spectrum, up to 6 orders of magnitude in the mid-IR and up to 4 orders of magnitude at telecommunications wavelengths, reaching quantum efficiencies of 95\% and 89\%, respectively, with high-mobility graphene. We obtain Purcell enhancement factors for single-photon electric dipole (E1), electric quadrupole (E2), and electric octupole (E3) transitions and two-photon spontaneous emission (2PSE) transitions, of the orders of $10^{4}$, $10^{7}$, $10^{9}$, and $10^9$, respectively, and a quantum efficiency of 79\% for entangled-photon emission with high-mobility graphene at a wavelength of $λ=1.55$ $μ$m. Importantly, AGP mode frequencies depend on the graphene Fermi energy, which can be tuned via electrostatic gating to modulate fluorescence enhancement in real time. As an example, we consider the Purcell enhancement of spontaneous single- and two-photon emissions from an erbium atom inside single-layer (SL) WS$_2$. Our results could be useful for electrically tunable quantum emitter devices with applications in quantum communication and quantum information processing.

Abstract: Bistability-two distinct stable states under identical parameter-is not only a fundamental physical concept but also of importance in practical applications. While plasmon-polaritonic bistability representing history-dependent stable states within plasmonic systems has been theoretically predicted, it has yet to be demonstrated experimentally due to challenges in realizing suitable nonlinearity at feasible electric-field strengths. Here, we report the experimental observation of electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene tunneling transistors, achieved through momentum-conserving resonant tunneling of Dirac electrons. Using a small twist angle between graphene layers, we engineered devices exhibiting both electronic and plasmon-polaritonic bistability. This bistable plasmonic behavior can be precisely tuned through load resistance and electrostatic gating. Our findings open new pathways for exploring nonlinear optical and electronic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures and mark a significant advance in nanoplasmonics, with potential applications in optical memory, sensing, and optoelectronic switching.
