Abstract: Bilinear observation problems arise in many physical and information-theoretic settings, where observables and states enter multiplicatively. Rank-based diagnostics are commonly used in such problems to assess the effective dimensionality accessible to observation, often under the implicit assumption that rank deficiency can be resolved through numerical refinement. Here we examine this assumption by analyzing the rank and nullity of a bilinear observation operator under systematic tolerance variation. Rather than focusing on a specific reconstruction algorithm, we study the operator directly and identify extended rank plateaus that persist across broad tolerance ranges. These plateaus indicate stable dimensional deficits that are not removed by refinement procedures applied within a fixed problem definition. To investigate the origin of this behavior, we resolve the nullspace into algebraic sectors defined by the block structure of the variables. The nullspace exhibits a pronounced but nonexclusive concentration in specific sectors, revealing an organized internal structure rather than uniform dimensional loss. Comparing refinement with explicit modification of the problem formulation further shows that rank recovery in the reported setting requires a change in the structure of the observation problem itself. Here, "problem modification" refers to changes that alter the bilinear observation structure (e.g., admissible operator/state families or coupling constraints), in contrast to refinements that preserve the original formulation such as tolerance adjustment and numerical reparameterizations. Together, these results delineate limits of rank recovery in bilinear observation problems and clarify the distinction between numerical refinement and problem modification in accessing effective dimensional structure.

Abstract: Wave packet revivals and fractional revivals are hallmark quantum interference phenomena that arise in systems with nonlinear energy spectra, and their signatures in expectation values of observables have been studied extensively in earlier work. In this article, we build on these studies and extend the analysis in two important directions. First, we investigate fractional revival dynamics in angular momentum observables, deriving explicit expressions for the time evolution of their moments and demonstrating that higher-order angular momentum moments provide clear and selective signatures of fractional revivals. Second, we examine classical analogs of quantum revival phenomena and elucidate structural similarities between quantum fractional revivals and recurrence behavior in representative classical systems. Using the Kerr-type nonlinear Hamiltonian as a paradigmatic model, we analyze the autocorrelation function, moment dynamics, and phase-space structures, supported by visualizations such as quantum carpets. Our results broaden the range of experimentally accessible diagnostics of fractional revivals and provide a unified perspective on revival phenomena across quantum and classical dynamical systems.

Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is one of the central organizing principles in physics. Time crystals have emerged as an exotic phase of matter, spontaneously breaking the time translational symmetry, and are mainly categorized as discrete or continuous. While these distinct types of time crystals have been extensively explored as standalone systems, intriguing effects can arise from their mutual interaction. Here, we demonstrate that a time-independent coupled system of discrete and continuous time crystals induces a simultaneous two-fold temporal symmetry breaking, resulting in a hierarchical time crystal phase. Interestingly, one of the subsystems breaks an emergent discrete temporal symmetry that does not exist in the dynamical generator but rather emerges dynamically, leading to a convoluted non-equilibrium phase. We demonstrate that hierarchical time crystals are robust, emerging for fundamentally different coupling schemes and persisting across wide ranges of system parameters.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the zero-error capacity of pure-state classical-quantum channels in the setting of list decoding. We provide an achievability bound for list-size two and a converse bound holding for every fixed list size. The two bounds coincide for channels whose pairwise absolute state overlaps form a positive semi-definite matrix. Finally, we discuss a remarkable peculiarity of the classical-quantum case: differently from the fully classical setting, the rate at which the sphere-packing bound diverges might not be achievable by zero-error list codes, even when we take the limit of fixed but arbitrarily large list size.

Abstract: A key challenge in quantum sensing is the detection of weak time dependent signals, particularly those that arise as specific frequency perturbations over a background field. Conventional methods usually demand complex dynamical control of the quantum sensor and heavy classical post-processing. We propose a quantum sensor that leverages time independent interactions and entanglement to function as a passive, tunable, thresholded frequency filter. By encoding the frequency selectivity and thresholding behavior directly into the dynamics, the sensor is responsive only to a target frequency of choice whose amplitude is above a threshold. This approach circumvents the need for complex control schemes and reduces the post-processing overhead.

Abstract: Product code construction is a powerful tool for constructing quantum stabilizer codes, which serve as a promising paradigm for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Furthermore, the natural mapping between stabilizer codes and the ground states of exactly solvable spin models also motivates the exploration of many-body orders in the stabilizer codes. In this work, we investigate the fracton topological orders in a family of codes obtained by a recently proposed general construction. More specifically, this code family can be regarded as a class of generalized hypergraph product (HGP) codes. We term the corresponding exactly solvable spin models \textit{orthoplex models}, based on the geometry of the stabilizers. In the 3D orthoplex model, we identify a series of intriguing properties within this model family, including non-monotonic ground state degeneracy (GSD) as a function of system size and non-Abelian lattice defects. Most remarkably, in 4D we discover \textit{fragmented topological excitations}: while such excitations manifest as discrete, isolated points in real space, their projections onto lower-dimensional subsystems form connected objects such as loops, revealing the intrinsic topological nature of these excitations. Therefore, fragmented excitations constitute an intriguing intermediate class between point-like and spatially extended topological excitations. In addition, these rich features establish the generalized HGP codes as a versatile and analytically tractable platform for studying the physics of fracton orders.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the optical dipole interaction between a multi-level quantum system and a single-mode optical waveguide of any local polarisation. We investigate several paradoxical seeming situations, for example we find a situation in which there exist two non-orthogonal quantum states, each of which results in a photon flux in the opposite direction to the other. We show how, despite appearances, this does not break the unitary requirements of quantum mechanics. We also find that an isotropic quantum emitter can be either reflective or transmissive to light depending on the waveguide polarisation at the emitter location, indeed in the zero loss limit such a system changes from 100% transmission to 100% reflection due to an infinitesimal polarisation rotation. An example case for a four level system is also considered, which is found to operate as a non-destructive parity measurement of the photon number.

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising approach for realizing low-overhead logical quantum memories. Recent theoretical developments have established shift automorphisms as a fundamental building block for completing the universal set of logical gates for qLDPC codes. However, practical challenges remain because the existing SWAP-based shift automorphism yields logical error rates that are orders of magnitude higher than those for fault-tolerant idle operations. In this work, we address this issue by dynamically varying the syndrome measurement circuits to implement the shift automorphisms without reducing the circuit distance. We benchmark our approach on both twisted and untwisted weight-6 generalized toric codes, including the gross code family. Our time-dynamic circuits for shift automorphisms achieve performance comparable to the idle operations under the circuit-level noise model (SI1000). Specifically, the dynamic circuits achieve more than an order of magnitude reduction in logical error rates relative to the SWAP-based scheme for the gross code at a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, employing the BP-OSD decoder. Our findings improve both the error resilience and the time overhead of the shift automorphisms in qLDPC codes. Furthermore, our work can lead to alternative syndrome extraction circuit designs, such as leakage removal protocols, providing a practical pathway to utilizing dynamic circuits that extend beyond surface codes towards qLDPC codes.

Abstract: We analyze quantum systems under a broad class of protocols in which the temperature and a Hamiltonian control parameter are ramped simultaneously and, in general, in a nonlinear fashion toward a quantum critical point. Using an open-system version of a Kitaev quantum wire as an example, we show that, unlike finite-temperature protocols at fixed temperature, these protocols allow us to probe, in an out-of-equilibrium situation and at finite temperature, the universality class (characterized by the critical exponents $ν$ and $z$) of an equilibrium quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Key to this is the identification of ramps in which both coherent and incoherent parts of the open-system dynamics affect the excitation density in a non-negligible way. We also identify the specific ramps for which subleading corrections to the asymptotic scaling laws are suppressed, which serves as a guide to dynamically probing quantum critical exponents in experimentally realistic finite-temperature situations.

Abstract: Fast, reliable decoders are pivotal components for enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). Neural network decoders like AlphaQubit have demonstrated potential, achieving higher accuracy than traditional human-designed decoding algorithms. However, existing implementations of neural network decoders lack the parallelism required to decode the syndrome stream generated by a superconducting logical qubit in real time. Moreover, integrating AlphaQubit with sliding window-based parallel decoding schemes presents non-trivial challenges: AlphaQubit is trained solely to output a single bit corresponding to the global logical correction for an entire memory experiment, rather than local physical corrections that can be easily integrated. We address this issue by training a recurrent, transformer-based neural network specifically tailored for parallel window decoding. While it still outputs a single bit, we derive training labels from a consistent set of local corrections and train on various types of decoding windows simultaneously. This approach enables the network to self-coordinate across neighboring windows, facilitating high-accuracy parallel decoding of arbitrarily long memory experiments.
  As a result, we overcome the throughput bottleneck that previously precluded the use of AlphaQubit-type decoders in FTQC. Our work presents the first scalable, neural-network-based parallel decoding framework that simultaneously achieves SOTA accuracy and the stringent throughput required for real-time quantum error correction. Using an end-to-end experimental workflow, we benchmark our decoder on the Zuchongzhi 3.2 superconducting quantum processor on surface codes with distances up to 7, demonstrating its superior accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate that, using our approach, a single TPU v6e is capable of decoding surface codes with distances up to 25 within 1us per decoding round.

Abstract: Quantum annealing is typically regarded as a tool for combinatorial optimization, but its coherent dynamics also offer potential for machine learning. We present a model that encodes classical data into an Ising Hamiltonian, evolves it on a quantum annealer, and uses the resulting probability distributions as feature maps for classification. Experiments on the quantum annealer machine with the Digits dataset, together with simulations on MNIST, demonstrate that short annealing times yield higher classification accuracy, while longer times reduce accuracy but lower sampling costs. We introduce the participation ratio as a measure of the effective model size and show its strong correlation with generalization.

Abstract: Quantum Computing (QC) has evolved from a few custom quantum computers, which were only accessible to their creators, to an array of commercial quantum computers that can be accessed on the cloud by anyone. Accessing these cloud quantum computers requires a complex chain of tools that facilitate connecting, programming, simulating algorithms, estimating resources, submitting quantum computing jobs, retrieving results, and more. Some steps in the chain are hardware dependent and subject to change as both hardware and software tools, such as available gate sets and optimizing compilers, evolve. Understanding the trade-offs inherent in this process is essential for evaluating the power and utility of quantum computers. ARLIS has been systematically investigating these environments to understand these complexities. The work presented here is a detailed summary of three months of using such quantum programming environments. We show metadata obtained from these environments, including the connection metrics to the different services, the execution of algorithms, the testing of the effects of varying the number of qubits, comparisons to simulations, execution times, and cost. Our objective is to provide concrete data and insights for those who are exploring the potential of quantum computing. It is not our objective to present any new algorithms or optimize performance on any particular machine or cloud platform; rather, this work is focused on providing a consistent view of a single algorithm executed using out-of-the-box settings and tools across machines, cloud platforms, and time. We present insights only available from these carefully curated data.

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for computing ground state energies of molecular systems. We implement VQE to calculate the potential energy surface of the hydrogen molecule (H$_2$) across 100 bond lengths using the PennyLane quantum computing framework on an HPC cluster featuring 4$\times$ NVIDIA H100 GPUs (80GB each). We present a comprehensive parallelization study with four phases: (1) Optimizer + JIT compilation achieving 4.13$\times$ speedup, (2) GPU device acceleration achieving 3.60$\times$ speedup at 4 qubits scaling to 80.5$\times$ at 26 qubits, (3) MPI parallelization achieving 28.5$\times$ speedup, and (4) Multi-GPU scaling achieving 3.98$\times$ speedup with 99.4% parallel efficiency across 4 H100 GPUs. The combined effect yields 117$\times$ total speedup for the H$_2$ potential energy surface (593.95s $\rightarrow$ 5.04s). We conduct a CPU vs GPU scaling study from 4--26 qubits, finding GPU advantage at all scales with speedups ranging from 10.5$\times$ to 80.5$\times$. Multi-GPU benchmarks demonstrate near-perfect scaling with 99.4% efficiency and establish that a single H100 can simulate up to 29 qubits before hitting memory limits. The optimized implementation reduces runtime from nearly 10 minutes to 5 seconds, enabling interactive quantum chemistry exploration.

Abstract: Photon statistics plays a governing role in multi-photon interference. While interference visibility in the standard two-photon case, known as Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, monotonically degrades with higher intensity correlation functions, we show that this monotonicity does not hold for three-photon interference in symmetric circuits. We reveal that, in the discrete Fourier transform circuit, engineered super-Poissonian photon-number fluctuations, realized using a modulated laser, maximize the visibility, surpassing the magnitude of the single-photon signature. In addition, by tuning the symmetric circuit parameters, we demonstrate that the visibility hierarchy inverts relative to the benchmark of Poissonian statistics. This trade-off implies that quantum and classical advantages are mutually exclusive resources for interference, indicating a form of statistical complementarity.

Abstract: Recent studies of moiré physics have unveiled a wealth of opportunities for significantly advancing the field of quantum phase transitions. However, properties of reentrant phase transitions driven by moiré strength are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the reentrant sequence of phase transitions and the invariant of universality class in moiré-modulated extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. For the simplified case with intercell hopping $w=0$, we analytically derive renormalization relations of Hamiltonian parameters to explain the reentrant phenomenon. For the general case, numerical phase boundaries are calculated in the thermodynamic limit. The bulk boundary correspondence between zero-energy edge modes and entanglement spectrum is revealed from the degeneracy of both quantities. We also address the correspondence between the central charge obtained from entanglement entropy and the change in winding number during the phase transition. Our results shed light on the understanding of universal characteristics and bulk-boundary correspondence for moiré induced reentrant phase transitions in 1D condensed-matter systems.

Abstract: The subadditivity-doubling-rotation (SDR) technique is a powerful route to Gaussian optimality in classical information theory and relies on strict subadditivity and its equality-case analysis, where double Markovity is a standard tool. We establish quantum analogues of double Markovity. For tripartite states, we characterize the simultaneous Markov conditions A-B-C and A-C-B via compatible projective measurements on B and C that induce a common classical label J yielding A-J-(BC). For strictly positive four-party states, we show that A-(BD)-C and A-(CD)-B hold if and only if A-D-(BC) holds. These results remove a key bottleneck in extending SDR-type arguments to quantum systems.

Abstract: We investigate the coherence properties of parity-protected $\cos(2\varphi)$ qubits based on interferences between two Josephson elements in a superconducting loop. We show that qubit implementations of a $\cos(2\varphi)$ potential using a single loop, such as those employing semiconducting junctions, rhombus circuits, flowermon and KITE structures, can be described by the same Hamiltonian as two multi-harmonic Josephson junctions in a SQUID geometry. We find that, despite the parity protection arising from the suppression of single Cooper pair tunneling, there exists a fundamental trade-off between charge and flux noise dephasing channels. Using numerical simulations, we examine how relaxation and dephasing rates depend on external flux and circuit parameters, and we identify the best compromise for maximum coherence. With currently existing circuit parameters, the qubit lifetime $T_1$ can exceed milliseconds while the dephasing time $T_\varphi$ remains limited to only a few microseconds due to either flux or charge noise. Our findings establish practical limits on the coherence of this class of qubits and raise questions about the long-term potential of this approach.

Abstract: We investigate the open system dynamics of a micromaser quantum battery operating in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime under environmental dissipation. The battery consists of a single-mode electromagnetic cavity sequentially interacting, via the Rabi Hamiltonian, with a stream of qubits acting as chargers. Dissipative effects arise from the weak coupling of the qubit-cavity system to a thermal bath. Non-negligible in the USC regime, the counter-rotating terms substantially improve the charging speed, but also lead, in the absence of dissipation, to unbounded energy growth and highly mixed cavity states. Dissipation during each qubit-cavity interaction mitigates these detrimental effects, yielding steady-state of finite energy and ergotropy. Optimal control on qubit preparation and interaction times enhances battery's performance in: (i) Maximizing the stored ergotropy trhough an optimized charging protocol; (ii) Stabilizing the stored ergotropy against dissipative losses through an optimized measurement-based passive-feedback strategy. Overall, our numerical results demonstrate that the interplay of ultrastrong light-matter coupling, controlled dissipation, and optimized control strategies enables micromaser quantum batteries to achieve both enhanced charging performance and long-term stability under realistic conditions.

Abstract: Decision making often exhibits context dependence that challenges classical probability theory. While quantum cognition has successfully modeled such phenomena, it remains unclear whether quantum probability is merely a convenient assumption or a necessary consequence of decision dynamics. Here we present a theoretical framework in which contextuality arises generatively from physically grounded constraints on decision making. By developing a quantum extension of the Tug-of-War (TOW) model, we show that conservation-based internal state updates and measurement-induced disturbance preclude any non-contextual classical description with a single, unified internal state. Contextuality therefore emerges as a structural consequence of adaptive learning dynamics. We further show that the resulting measurement structure admits Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky (KCBS)-type contextuality witnesses in a minimal single-system setting. These results indicate that quantum probability is not merely a descriptive convenience, but an unavoidable effective theory for adaptive decision dynamics.

Abstract: In the thermodynamic limit, the Dicke-Ising chain maps exactly onto an effective self-consistent matter Hamiltonian with the photon field acting solely as a self-consistent effective field. As a consequence, no quantum correlations between photons and spins are needed to understand the quantum phase diagram. This enables us to determine the quantum phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit using numerical linked-cluster expansions combined with density matrix renormalization group calculations (NLCE+DMRG) to solve the resulting self-consistent matter Hamiltonian. This includes magnetically ordered phases with significantly improved accuracy compared to previous estimates. For ferromagnetic Ising couplings, we refine the location of the multicritical point governing the change in the order of the superradiant phase transition, reaching a relative accuracy of $10^{-4}$. For antiferromagnetic Ising couplings, we confirm the existence of the narrow antiferromagnetic superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit. The effective matter Hamiltonian framework identifies the antiferromagnetic superradiant phase as the many-body ground state of an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with longitudinal field. This phase emerges through continuous Dicke-type polariton condensation from the antiferromagnetic normal phase, followed by a first-order transition to the paramagnetic superradiant phase. Thus, NLCE+DMRG provides a precise determination of the Dicke-Ising phase diagram in one dimension by solving the self-consistent effective matter Hamiltonian.

Abstract: The high overhead of fault-tolerant measurement sequences (FTMSs) poses a major challenge for implementing quantum stabilizer codes. Here, we address this problem by constructing efficient FTMSs for the class of quantum Hamming codes $[\![2^r-1, 2^r-1-2r, 3]\!]$ with $r=3k+1$ ($k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$). Our key result demonstrates that the sequence length can be reduced to exactly $2r+1$-only one additional measurement beyond the original non-fault-tolerant sequence, establishing a tight lower bound. The proposed method leverages cyclic matrix transformations to systematically combine rows of the initial stabilizer matrix and preserving a self-dual CSS-like symmetry analogous to that of the original quantum Hamming codes. This induced symmetry enables hardware-efficient circuit reuse: the measurement circuits for the first $r$ stabilizers are transformed into circuits for the remaining $r$ stabilizers simply by toggling boundary Hadamard gates, eliminating redundant hardware. For distance-3 fault-tolerant error correction, our approach simultaneously reduces the time overhead via shorting the FTMS length and the hardware overhead through symmetry-enabled circuit multiplexing. These results provide an important advance towards the important open problem regarding the design of minimal FTMSs for quantum Hamming codes and may shed light on similar challenges in other quantum stabilizer codes.

Abstract: While spin squeezing has been traditionally considered in all-to-all interacting models, recent works have shown that spin squeezing can occur in systems with power-law interactions, leading to direct testing in Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, ultracold atoms and nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the latter, Wu. et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin-squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is essential for characterizing quantum systems, but it becomes infeasible for large systems due to exponential resource scaling. Overlapping tomography addresses this challenge by reconstructing all $k$-body marginals using few measurement settings, enabling the efficient extraction of key information for many quantum tasks. While optimal schemes are known for qubits, the extension to higher-dimensional qudit systems remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate optimal qudit overlapping tomography, constructing local measurement settings from generalized Gell-Mann matrices. By establishing a correspondence with combinatorial covering arrays, we present two explicit constructions of optimal measurement schemes. For $n$-qutrit systems, we prove that pairwise tomography requires at most $8 + 56\left\lceil \log_{8} n \right\rceil$ measurement settings, and provide an explicit scheme achieving this bound. Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm to determine the optimal order of these measurement settings, minimizing the experimental overhead associated with switching configurations. Compared to the worst-case ordering, our optimized schedule reduces switching costs by approximately 50\%. These results provide a practical pathway for efficient characterization of qudit systems, facilitating their application in quantum communication and computation.

Abstract: Static phase detuning fundamentally constrains coherent state transfer in asymmetric classical and quantum systems. We introduce a Bloch-sphere formulation for piecewise-coherent modulation that recasts coupled-mode dynamics as geometric trajectories, transforming algebraic control into path optimization. The approach reveals a cone of inaccessibility at the target pole and yields exact geodesic criteria for complete mode conversion in detuned systems. Leveraging this framework, we break time-reversal symmetry to realize a magnet-free optical isolator with near-unity contrast. Furthermore, for detuning larger than coupling between modes, we develop a recursive multi-step protocol enabling deterministic transfer for arbitrary detunings and derive a universal geometric lower bound on the required number of coupling-switching events.

Abstract: We study the Fano effect in dissipative cavity quantum electrodynamics, which originates from the interference between the emitter's direct radiation and that mediated by a cavity mode. Starting from a two-level system coupled to a structured reservoir, we show that a quantum master equation previously derived within the Born-Markov approximation can be rederived by introducing a single auxiliary mode via pseudomode approach. We identify the corresponding spectral function of the system--environment interaction and demonstrate that it consists of a constant and a non-Lorentzian contribution forming the Fano profile. The constant term is shown to be essential for obtaining a Lindblad master equation and is directly related to the rate associated with this Fano interference. Furthermore, by applying Fano diagonalization to a common-environment setup including an explicit cavity mode, we independently derive the same spectral function in the strongest-interference regime. Our results establish a unified framework for describing the Fano effect in single-mode cavity QED systems and clarify its non-Markovian origin encoded in the spectral function.

Abstract: Magic states are essential for universal quantum computation and are widely viewed as a key source of quantum advantage, yet in realistic devices they are inevitably noisy. In this work, we characterize how noise on injected magic resources changes the classical simulability of quantum circuits and when it induces a transition from classically intractable behavior to efficient classical simulation. We adopt a resource-centric noise model in which only the injected magic components are noisy, while the baseline states, operations, and measurements belong to an efficiently simulable family. Within this setting, we develop an approximate classical sampling algorithm with controlled error and prove explicit noise-dependent conditions under which the algorithm runs in polynomial time. Our framework applies to both qubit circuits with Clifford baselines and fermionic circuits with matchgate baselines, covering representative noise channels such as dephasing and particle loss. We complement the analysis with numerical estimates of the simulation cost, providing concrete thresholds and runtime scaling across practically relevant parameter regimes.

Abstract: Casimir forces arise from quantum electromagnetic fluctuations and depend on the dielectric response of interacting materials across the entire frequency spectrum. Although this dependence is central to Lifshitz theory of the Casimir effect, the formulation of the force in terms of dielectric functions evaluated at imaginary frequencies has largely obscured its connection to real-frequency optical properties, limiting the use of Casimir interactions as a probe of materials. Here we demonstrate that Casimir force measurements encode sufficient information to reconstruct a material's broadband optical response. Using supervised machine learning to invert Lifshitz theory, we determine the complex permittivity of a material over more than seven orders of magnitude in frequency from a single force-distance curve. We show that measurements at different separations selectively constrain distinct frequency ranges of the dielectric response, providing direct physical insight into how quantum fluctuations sample the electromagnetic spectrum. These results establish Casimir interactions as a physically constrained, broadband spectroscopic tool and open new opportunities for optical characterization in regimes inaccessible to conventional techniques.

Abstract: The transition to the fault-tolerant era exposes the limitations of homogeneous quantum systems, where no single qubit modality simultaneously offers optimal operation speed, connectivity, and scalability. In this work, we propose a strategic approach to Heterogeneous Quantum Architectures (HQA) that synthesizes the distinct advantages of the superconducting (SC) and neutral atom (NA) platforms. We explore two architectural role assignment strategies based on hardware characteristics: (1) We offload the latency-critical Magic State Factory (MSF) to fast SC devices while performing computation on scalable NA arrays, a design we term MagicAcc, which effectively mitigates the resource-preparation bottleneck. (2) We explore a Memory-Compute Separation (MCSep) paradigm that utilizes NA arrays for high-density qLDPC memory storage and SC devices for fast surface-code processing. Our evaluation, based on a comprehensive end-to-end cost model, demonstrates that principled heterogeneity yields significant performance gains. Specifically, our designs achieve $752\times$ speedup over NA-only baselines on average and reduce the physical qubit footprint by over $10\times$ compared to SC-only systems. These results chart a clear pathway for leveraging cross-modality interconnects to optimize the space-time efficiency of future fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Abstract: Recent studies have extensively explored chaotic dynamics in quantum optical systems through the mean-field approximation, which corresponds to an ideal, fluctuation-free scenario. However, the inherent sensitivity of chaos to initial conditions implies that even minute fluctuations can be amplified, thereby questioning the applicability of this approximation. Here, we analyze these chaotic effects using stochastic Langevin equations or the Lindblad master equation. For systems operating at frequencies of $10^5$ to $10^7$ Hz, we demonstrate that room-temperature thermal fluctuations are sufficient to suppress chaos at the level of expectation values, even under weak nonlinearity. Furthermore, nonlinearity induces deviations from Gaussian phase-space distributions of the quantum state, revealing attractor-like features in the Wigner function. With increasing nonlinearity, the noise threshold for chaos suppression decreases, approaching the scale of vacuum fluctuations. These results provide a bidirectional validation of the quantum mechanical suppression of chaos.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms are gaining attention in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their favorable scaling, as encoding physical fields into quantum probability amplitudes enables representation of two to the power of n spatial points with only n qubits. A key challenge in Quantum CFD is the efficient readout of simulation results, a topic that has received limited attention in literature. This work presents methods to extract statistical properties of spatial velocity fields, such as central moments and structure functions, directly from parameterized ansatz circuits, avoiding full quantum state tomography. As a proof of concept, we implement our approach for 1D velocity fields, encoding 16 spatial points with 4 qubits, and analyze both a sine wave signal and four snapshots from Burgers' equation evolution. Using Qedma's error mitigation software QESEM, we demonstrate that such computations achieve high accuracy on current quantum devices, specifically IBMQ's Heron2 system ibm_fez.

Abstract: Historically, the focus in entanglement distillation has predominantly been on the distillable entanglement, and the framework assumes complete knowledge of the initial state. In this paper, we study the reliability function of entanglement distillation, which specifies the optimal exponent of the decay of the distillation error when the distillation rate is below the distillable entanglement. Furthermore, to capture greater operational significance, we extend the framework from the standard setting of known states to a black-box setting, where distillation is performed from a set of possible states. We establish an exact finite blocklength result connecting to composite correlated hypothesis testing without any redundant correction terms. Based on this, the reliability function of entanglement distillation is characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence. In the special case of a pure initial state, our result reduces to the error exponent for entanglement concentration derived by Hayashi et al. in 2003. Given full prior knowledge of the state, we construct a concrete optimal distillation protocol. Additionally, we analyze the strong converse exponent of entanglement distillation. While all the above results assume the free operations to be non-entangling, we also investigate other free operation classes, including PPT-preserving, dually non-entangling, and dually PPT-preserving operations.

Abstract: We demonstrate that large language model (LLM) agents can autonomously perform tensor network simulations of quantum many-body systems, achieving approximately 90% success rate across representative benchmark tasks. Tensor network methods are powerful tools for quantum simulation, but their effective use requires expertise typically acquired through years of graduate training. By combining in-context learning with curated documentation and multi-agent decomposition, we create autonomous AI agents that can be trained in specialized computational domains within minutes. We benchmark three configurations (baseline, single-agent with in-context learning, and multi-agent with in-context learning) on problems spanning quantum phase transitions, open quantum system dynamics, and photochemical reactions. Systematic evaluation using DeepSeek-V3.2, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.5 demonstrates that both in-context learning and multi-agent architecture are essential. Analysis of failure modes reveals characteristic patterns across models, with the multi-agent configuration substantially reducing implementation errors and hallucinations compared to simpler architectures.

Abstract: Studying the complexity of states sampled from various ensembles is a central component of quantum information theory. In this work we establish the average-case hardness of learning, in the statistical query model, the Born distributions of states sampled uniformly from the circular and (fermionic) Gaussian ensembles. These ensembles of states are induced variously by the uniform measures on the compact symmetric spaces of type AI, AII, and DIII. This finding complements analogous recent results for states sampled from the classical compact groups. On the technical side, we employ a somewhat unconventional approach to integrating over the compact groups which may be of some independent interest. For example, our approach allows us to exactly evaluate the total variation distances between the output distributions of Haar random unitary and orthogonal circuits and the constant distribution, which were previously known only approximately.

Abstract: Pre-execution calibration is a major bottleneck for operating superconducting quantum processors, and qubit frequency allocation is especially challenging due to crosstalk-coupled objectives. We establish that the widely-used Snake optimizer is mathematically equivalent to Block Coordinate Descent (BCD), providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for this calibration strategy. Building on this formalization, we present a topology-aware block ordering obtained by casting order selection as a Sequence-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem (SD-TSP) and solving it efficiently with a nearest-neighbor heuristic. The SD-TSP cost reflects how a given block choice expands the reduced-circuit footprint required to evaluate the block-local objective, enabling orders that minimize per-epoch evaluation time. Under local crosstalk/bounded-degree assumptions, the method achieves linear complexity in qubit count per epoch, while retaining calibration quality. We formalize the calibration objective, clarify when reduced experiments are equivalent or approximate to the full objective, and analyze convergence of the resulting inexact BCD with noisy measurements. Simulations on multi-qubit models show that the proposed BCD-NNA ordering attains the same optimization accuracy at markedly lower runtime than graph-based heuristics (BFS, DFS) and random orders, and is robust to measurement noise and tolerant to moderate non-local crosstalk. These results provide a scalable, implementation-ready workflow for frequency calibration on NISQ-era processors.

Abstract: We analyze quantum state preservation in open quantum systems using quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes that are explicitly embedded into microscopic system-bath models. Instead of abstract quantum channels, we consider multi-qubit registers coupled to bosonic thermal environments, derive a second-order master equation for the reduced dynamics, and use it to benchmark the five-qubit, Steane, and toric codes under local and collective noise. We compute state fidelities for logical qubits as functions of coupling strength, bath temperature, and the number of correction cycles. In the low-temperature regime, we find that repeated error-correction with the five-qubit code strongly suppresses decoherence and relaxation, while in the high-temperature regime, thermal excitations dominate the dynamics and reduce the benefit of all codes, though the five-qubit code still outperforms the Steane and toric codes. For two-qubit Werner states, we identify a critical evolution time before which QEC does not improve fidelity, and this time increases as entanglement grows. After this critical time, QEC does improve fidelity. Comparative analysis further reveals that the five-qubit code (the smallest perfect code) offers consistently higher fidelities than topological and concatenated architectures in these open-system settings. These findings establish a quantitative framework for evaluating QEC under realistic noise environments and provide guidance for developing noise-resilient quantum architectures in near-term quantum technologies.

Abstract: Several photonic quantum technologies rely on the ability to generate multiple indistinguishable photons. Benchmarking the level of indistinguishability of these photons is essential for scalability. The Hong-Ou-Mandel dip provides a benchmark for the indistinguishability between two photons, and extending this test to the multi-photon setting has so far resulted in a protocol that computes the genuine n-photon indistinguishability (GI). However, this protocol has a sample complexity that increases exponentially with the number of input photons for an estimation of GI up to a given additive error. To address this problem, we introduce new theorems that strengthen our understanding of the relationship between distinguishability and the suppression laws of the quantum Fourier transform interferometer (QFT). Building on this, we propose a protocol using the QFT for benchmarking GI that achieves constant sample complexity for the estimation of GI up to a given additive error for prime photon numbers, and sub-polynomial scaling otherwise, representing an exponential improvement over the state of the art. We prove the optimality of our protocol in many relevant scenarios and validate our approach experimentally on Quandela's reconfigurable photonic quantum processor, where we observe a clear advantage in runtime and precision over the state of the art. We therefore establish the first scalable method for computing multi-photon indistinguishability, which applies naturally to current and near-term photonic quantum hardware.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical study of the light-induced shift of the coherent population trapping resonance. An analytical model is proposed that describes the interaction of two radiation components with an atomic system using a $Λ$ scheme and takes into account an additional level of excited state. Both weak and strong coupling regimes with off-resonant transitions are considered. It is shown that, in addition to the conventional dynamic Stark shift, an extra shift arises due to the distortion of the resonance line shape when bichromatic laser radiation interacts with off-resonant atomic transitions. An analytical expression for this additional shift is derived in the weak-coupling limit, and its significant impact on the resonance shape and sensitivity to the intensities of the laser field components is demonstrated. It is found that under strong coupling conditions, the additional shift can deviate substantially from a linear dependence on light intensity, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light shifts in precision atomic devices such as quantum frequency standards.

Abstract: The manipulation of distinct degrees of freedom of photons plays a critical role in both classical and quantum information processing. While the principles of wave optics provide elegant and scalable control over classical light in spatial and temporal domains, engineering quantum states in Fock space has been largely restricted to few-photon regimes, hindered by the computational and experimental challenges of large Hilbert spaces. Here, we introduce ``Fock-space optics", establishing a conceptual framework of wave propagation in the quantum domain by treating photon number as a synthetic dimension. Using a superconducting microwave resonator, we experimentally demonstrate Fock-space analogues of optical propagation, refraction, lensing, dispersion, and interference with up to 180 photons. These results establish a fundamental correspondence between Schrödinger evolution in a single bosonic mode and classical paraxial wave propagation. By mapping intuitive optical concepts onto high-dimensional quantum state engineering, our work opens a path toward scalable control of large-scale quantum systems with thousands of photons and advanced bosonic information processing.

To connect with realistic photodetection scenarios, we model the detection region as a square prism operating over a finite time window and consider a normally incident single-mode coherent state. Numerical results exhibit the expected qualitative behavior: suppressing dark counts necessarily tightens the achievable click probability.

Abstract: Learning the Hamiltonian governing a quantum system is a central task in quantum metrology, sensing, and device characterization. Existing Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning protocols either require multi-qubit operations that are prone to noise, or single-qubit operations whose frequency or strength increases with the desired precision. These two requirements limit the applicability of Hamiltonian learning on near-term quantum platforms. We present a protocol that learns a quantum Hamiltonian with the optimal Heisenberg-limited scaling using only single-qubit control in the form of static fields with strengths that are independent of the target precision. Our protocol is robust against the state preparation and measurement (SPAM) error. By overcoming these limitations, our protocol provides new tools for device characterization and quantum sensing. We demonstrate that our method achieves the Heisenberg-limited scaling through rigorous mathematical proof and numerical experiments. We also prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that a non-vanishing static field strength is necessary for achieving the Heisenberg limit unless one employs an extensive number of discrete control operations.

Abstract: High-Q bosonic memories are central to hardware-efficient quantum error correction, but their isolation makes fast, high-fidelity reset a persistent bottleneck. Existing approaches either rely on weak intermode cross-Kerr conversion or on measurement-based sequences with substantial latency. Here we demonstrate a hardware-efficient Rabi-Driven Reset (RDR) that implements continuous, measurement-free cooling of a superconducting cavity mode. A strong resonant Rabi drive on a transmon, together with sideband drives on the memory and readout modes detuned by the Rabi frequency, converts the dispersive interaction into an effective Jaynes-Cummings coupling between the qubit dressed states and each mode. This realizes a tunable dissipation channel from the memory to the cold readout bath. Crucially, the engineered coupling scales with the qubit-mode dispersive interaction and the drive amplitude, rather than with the intermode cross-Kerr, enabling fast cooling even in very weakly coupled architectures that deliberately suppress direct mode-mode coupling. We demonstrate RDR of a single photon with a decay time of $1.2 μs$, more than two orders of magnitude faster than the intrinsic lifetime. Furthermore, we reset about 30 thermal photons in about $80 μs$ to a steady-state average photon number of $\bar{n} = 0.045 \pm 0.025$.

Abstract: Calculating bounds of properties of many-body quantum systems is of paramount importance, since they guide our understanding of emergent quantum phenomena and complement the insights obtained from estimation methods. Recent semidefinite programming approaches enable probabilistic bounds from finite-shot measurements of easily accessible, yet informationally incomplete, observables. Here we render these methods scalable in the number of qubits by instead utilizing moment-matrix relaxations. After introducing the general formalism, we show how the approach can be adapted with specific knowledge of the system, such as it being the ground state of a given Hamiltonian, possessing specific symmetries or being the steady state of a given Lindbladian. Our approach defines a scalable real-world certification scheme leveraging semidefinite programming relaxations and experimental estimations which, unavoidably, contain shot noise.

Abstract: The evolution of an isolated quantum system inevitably exhibits recurrence: the state returns to the vicinity of its initial condition after finite time. Despite its fundamental nature, a rigorous quantitative understanding of recurrence has been lacking. We establish upper bounds on the recurrence time, $t_{\mathrm{rec}} \lesssim t_{\mathrm{exit}}(ε)(1/ε)^d$, where $d$ is the Hilbert-space dimension, $ε$ the neighborhood size, and $t_{\mathrm{exit}}(ε)$ the escape time from this neighborhood. For pure states evolving under a Hamiltonian $H$, estimating $t_{\mathrm{exit}}$ is equivalent to an inverse quantum speed limit problem: finding upper bounds on the time a time-evolved state $ψ_t$ needs to depart from the $ε$-vicinity of the initial state $ψ_0$. We provide a partial solution, showing that under mild assumptions $t_{\mathrm{exit}}(ε) \approx ε/\sqrt{ Δ(H^2)}$, with $Δ(H^2)$ the Hamiltonian variance in $ψ_0$. We show that our upper bound on $t_{\mathrm{rec}}$ is generically saturated for random Hamiltonians. Finally, we analyze the impact of coherence of the initial state in the eigenbasis of $H$ on recurrence behavior.

Abstract: Classical and quantum physics represent two distinct theories; however, quantum physics is regarded as the more fundamental of the two. It is posited that classical mechanics should arise from quantum mechanics under certain limiting conditions. Nevertheless, this remains a challenging objective. In this work, we explore the potential for unifying the dynamics of classical and quantum physics. This discussion does not suggest that classical behavior emerges from quantum mechanics; rather, it demonstrates the exact equivalence between the dynamics of quantum observables and their classical counterparts. It is shown that the Heisenberg equations of motion can be cast in a form that is identical to Newton's equations of motion, with $\hbar$ being absent from the formulation. This implies that both quantum and classical dynamics are governed by the same equations, with the Heisenberg operators substituting the classical observables.

Abstract: The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) imposes a fundamental constraint between current fluctuations and entropy production, providing a refined formulation of the second law for micro- and nanoscale systems. Quantum violations of the classical TUR reveal genuinely quantum thermodynamic effects, which are essential for improving performance and enabling optimization in quantum technologies. In this work, we analyze the TUR in a class of paradigmatic quantum thermal-machine models whose operation is enabled by coherent coupling between two energy levels forming a virtual qubit. Steady-state coherences are confined to this virtual-qubit subspace, while in the absence of coherent coupling the system satisfies detailed balance with the thermal reservoirs and supports no steady-state heat currents. We show that the steady-state currents and entropy production can be fully reproduced by an effective classical Markov process, whereas current fluctuations acquire an additional purely quantum correction originating from coherence. As a result, the thermodynamic uncertainty naturally decomposes into a classical (diagonal) contribution and a coherent contribution. The latter becomes negative under resonant conditions and reaches its minimum at the coupling strength that maximizes steady-state coherence. We further identify the optimization conditions and the criteria for surpassing the classical TUR bound in the vicinity of the reversible limit.

Abstract: We introduce SpinPulse, an open-source python package for simulating spin qubit-based quantum computers at the pulse-level. SpinPulse models the specific physics of spin qubits, particularly through the inclusion of classical non-Markovian noise. This enables realistic simulations of native gates and quantum circuits, in order to support hardware development. In SpinPulse, a quantum circuit is first transpiled into the native gate set of our model and then converted to a pulse sequence. This pulse sequence is subsequently integrated numerically in the presence of a simulated noisy experimental environment. We showcase workflows including transpilation, pulse-level compilation, hardware benchmarking, quantum error mitigation, and large-scale simulations via integration with the tensor-network library quimb. We expect SpinPulse to be a valuable open-source tool for the quantum computing community, fostering efforts to devise high-fidelity quantum circuits and improved strategies for quantum error mitigation and correction.

Abstract: We present a unified scheme for generating high-fidelity entangling gates in superconducting platforms by continuous dynamical decoupling (CDD) combined with variational minimal-energy optimal control. During the CDD stage, we suppress residual couplings, calibration drifting, and quasistatic noise, resulting in a stable effective Hamiltonian that preserves the designed ZZ interaction intended for producing tunable couplers. In this stable $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ manifold, we calculate smooth low-energy single-quibt control functions using a variational geodesic optimization process that directly minimizes gate infidelity. We illustrate the methodology by applying it to CZ, CX, and generic engangling gates, achieving virtually unit fidelity and robustness under restricted single-qubit action, with experimentally realistic control fields. These results establish CDD-enhanced variational geometric optimal control as a practical and noise-resilient scheme for designing superconducting entangling gates.

Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Filoche--Mayboroda localization landscape that extends the theory well beyond the static, elliptic and Hermitian settings while preserving its geometric interpretability. Using the positive operator $H^\dagger H$, we obtain a landscape that predicts localization across non-Hermitian, Floquet, and topological systems without computing eigenstates. Singular-value collapse reveals spectral instabilities and skin effects, the Sambe formulation captures coherent destruction of tunneling, and topological zero modes emerge directly from the landscape. Applications to Hatano--Nelson chains, driven two-level systems, and driven Aubry--André--Harper models confirm quantitative accuracy, establishing a unified predictor for localization in equilibrium and driven quantum matter.

Abstract: Fast and high fidelity shuttling of spin qubits has been demonstrated in semiconductor quantum dot devices. Several architectures based on shuttling have been proposed; it has been suggested that singlet-triplet (dual-spin) qubits could be optimal for the highest shuttling fidelities. Here we present a fault-tolerant framework for quantum error correction based on such dual-spin qubits, establishing them as a natural realisation of erasure qubits within semiconductor architectures. We introduce a hardware-efficient leakage-detection protocol that automatically projects leaked qubits back onto the computational subspace, without the need for measurement feedback or increased classical control overheads. When combined with the XZZX surface code and leakage-aware decoding, we demonstrate a twofold increase in the error correction threshold and achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in logical error rates. This establishes the singlet-triplet encoding as a practical route toward high-fidelity shuttling and erasure-based, fault-tolerant quantum computation in semiconductor devices.

Abstract: Quantum Amplitude Amplification (QAA), the generalization of Grover's algorithm, is capable of yielding optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems with high probabilities. In this work we extend the conventional 2-dimensional representation of Grover's (orthogonal collective states) to oracles which encode cost functions such as QUBO, and show that linear cost functions are a special case whereby an exact formula exists for determining optimal oracle parameter settings. Using simulations of problem sizes up to 40 qubits we demonstrate QAA's algorithmic performance across all possible solutions, with an emphasis on the closeness in Grover-like performance for solutions near the global optimum. We conclude with experimental demonstrations of generalized QAA on both IBMQ (superconducting) and IonQ (trapped ion) qubits, showing that the observed probabilities of each basis state match our equations as a function of varying the free parameters in the oracle and diffusion operators.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are critically threatened by the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. In this work, we introduce the H-EFT Variational Ansatz (H-EFT-VA), an architecture inspired by Effective Field Theory (EFT). By enforcing a hierarchical "UV-cutoff" on initialization, we theoretically restrict the circuit's state exploration, preventing the formation of approximate unitary 2-designs. We provide a rigorous proof that this localization guarantees an inverse-polynomial lower bound on the gradient variance: $Var[\partial θ] \in Ω(1/poly(N))$. Crucially, unlike approaches that avoid BPs by limiting entanglement, we demonstrate that H-EFT-VA maintains volume-law entanglement and near-Haar purity, ensuring sufficient expressibility for complex quantum states. Extensive benchmarking across 16 experiments -- including Transverse Field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ models -- confirms a 109x improvement in energy convergence and a 10.7x increase in ground-state fidelity over standard Hardware-Efficient Ansatze (HEA), with a statistical significance of $p < 10^{-88}$.

Abstract: Neutral atom quantum processors have emerged as a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, offering high-fidelity operations and exceptional qubit scalability. A key challenge in realizing practical applications is efficiently extracting readout outcomes while maintaining high system throughput, i.e., the rate of quantum task executions. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the trade-off between readout fidelity and atomic retention. Moreover, we introduce a metric of quantum circuit iteration rate (qCIR) and employ normalized quantum Fisher information to characterize system overall performance. Further, by carefully balancing fidelity and retention, we demonstrate a readout strategy for optimizing information acquisition efficiency. Considering the experimentally feasible parameters for 87Rb atoms, we demonstrate that qCIRs of 197.2Hz and 154.5Hz are achievable using single photon detectors and cameras, respectively. These results provide practical guidance for constructing scalable and high-throughput neutral atom quantum processors for applications in sensing, simulation, and near-term algorithm implementation.

Our analysis establishes relative smoothness with respect to the entropy geometry, guaranteeing a global sublinear convergence of the objective values. Furthermore, under a natural tangent-space nondegeneracy condition (and a mild spectral lower bound in one regime), we prove local linear (geometric) convergence in Kullback-Leibler divergence on a truncated probability simplex, with an explicit contraction factor once the local curvature constants are bounded.

Abstract: The scalable and deterministic preparation of large Fock-number states represents a long-standing frontier in quantum science, with direct implications for quantum metrology, communication, and simulation. Despite significant progress in small-scale implementations, extending such state generation to large excitation numbers while maintaining high fidelity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a scalable protocol for generating large Fock states with fidelities exceeding 0.9 up to photon numbers on the order of 100, achieved using only native control operations and, when desired, further enhanced by an optional post-selection step. Our method employs a hybrid Genetic-Adam optimization framework that combines the global search efficiency of genetic algorithms with the adaptive convergence of Adam to optimize multi-pulse control sequences comprising Jaynes-Cummings interactions and displacement operations, both of which are native to leading experimental platforms. The resulting control protocols achieve high fidelities with shallow circuit depths and strong robustness against parameter variations. These results establish an efficient and scalable pathway toward high-fidelity non-classical state generation for precision metrology and fault-tolerant quantum technologies.

Abstract: Whether neural information processing is entirely classical or involves quantum-mechanical elements remains an open question. Here we propose a model-agnostic, information-theoretic test of nonclassicality that bypasses microscopic assumptions and instead probes the structure of neural representations themselves. Using autoencoders as a transparent model system, we introduce a Bell-type consistency test in latent space, and ask whether decoding statistics obtained under multiple readout contexts can be jointly explained by a single positive latent-variable distribution. By shifting the search for quantum-like signatures in neural systems from microscopic dynamics to experimentally testable constraints on information processing, this work opens a new route for probing the fundamental physics of neural computation.

Abstract: Quantum embedding methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), provide a powerful framework for investigating strongly correlated materials. A central computational bottleneck in DMFT is in solving the Anderson impurity model (AIM), whose exact solution is classically intractable for large bath sizes. In this work, we develop and benchmark a quantum-classical hybrid solver tailored for DMFT applications, using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to prepare the ground state of the AIM with shallow quantum circuits. The solver uses a unified ansatz framework to prepare the particle and hole excitations of the ground-state from parameter-shifted circuits, enabling the reconstruction of the impurity Green's function through a continued-fraction expansion. We evaluate the performance of this approach across a few bath sizes and interaction strengths under noisy, shot-limited conditions. We compare three optimization routines (COBYLA, Adam, and L-BFGS-B) in terms of convergence and fidelity, assess the benefits of estimating a quantum-computed moment (QCM) correction to the variational energies, and benchmark the approach by comparing the reconstructed density of states (DOS) against that obtained using a classical pipeline. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of Green's function reconstruction on near-term devices and establish practical benchmarks for quantum impurity solvers embedded within self-consistent DMFT loops.

Abstract: It is known that the continuous-time variant of Grover's search algorithm is characterized by quantum search frameworks that are governed by stationary Hamiltonians, which result in search trajectories confined to the two-dimensional subspace of the complete Hilbert space formed by the source and target states. Specifically, the search approach is ineffective when the source and target states are orthogonal. In this paper, we employ normalization, orthogonality, and energy limitations to demonstrate that it is unfeasible to breach time-optimality between orthogonal states with constant Hamiltonians when the evolution is limited to the two-dimensional space spanned by the initial and final states. Deviations from time-optimality for unitary evolutions between orthogonal states can only occur with time-dependent Hamiltonian evolutions or, alternatively, with constant Hamiltonian evolutions in higher-dimensional subspaces of the entire Hilbert space. Ultimately, we employ our quantitative analysis to provide meaningful insights regarding the relationship between time-optimal evolutions and analog quantum search methods. We determine that the challenge of transitioning between orthogonal states with a constant Hamiltonian in a sub-optimal time is closely linked to the shortcomings of analog quantum search when the source and target states are orthogonal and not interconnected by the search Hamiltonian. In both scenarios, the fundamental cause of the failure lies in the existence of an inherent symmetry within the system.

Abstract: The Landau--Zener (LZ) model describes a two-level quantum system that undergoes an avoided crossing. In the adiabatic limit, the transition probability vanishes. An auxiliary control field $H_\text{CD}$ can be reverse-engineered so that the full Hamiltonian $H_0 + H_\text{CD}$ reproduces adiabaticity for all parameter values. Our aim is to construct a single control field $H_1$ that drives an ensemble of LZ-type Hamiltonians with a distribution of energy gaps. $H_1$ works best statistically, minimizing the average transition probability. We restrict our attention to a special class of $H_1$ controls, motivated by $H_\text{CD}$. We found a systematic trade-off between instantaneous adiabaticity and the final transition probability. Certain limiting cases with a linear sweep can be treated analytically; one of them being the LZ system with Dirac $δ(t)$ function. Comprehensive and systematic numerical simulations support and extend the analytic results.

Abstract: We examine the pertinent geometric characteristics of entanglement that arise from stationary Hamiltonian evolutions transitioning from separable to maximally entangled two-qubit quantum states. From a geometric perspective, each evolution is characterized by means of geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and curvature coefficient. Conversely, from the standpoint of entanglement, these evolutions are quantified using various metrics, such as concurrence, entanglement power, and entangling capability. Overall, our findings indicate that time-optimal evolution trajectories are marked by high geodesic efficiency, with no energy resource wastage, no curvature (i.e., zero bending), and an average path entanglement that is less than that observed in time-suboptimal evolutions. Additionally, when analyzing separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions between nonorthogonal states, time-optimal evolutions demonstrate a greater short-time degree of nonlocality compared to time-suboptimal evolutions between the same initial and final states. Interestingly, the reverse is generally true for separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions involving orthogonal states. Our investigation suggests that this phenomenon arises because suboptimal trajectories between orthogonal states are characterized by longer path lengths with smaller curvature, which are traversed with a higher energy resource wastage compared to suboptimal trajectories between nonorthogonal states. Consequently, a higher initial degree of nonlocality in the unitary time propagators appears to be essential for achieving the maximally entangled state from a separable state. Furthermore, when assessing optimal and suboptimal evolutions...

Abstract: In optimal quantum-mechanical evolutions, motion can take place along paths of minimal length within an optimal time frame. Alternatively, optimal evolutions may occur along established paths without any waste of energy resources and achieving 100% speed efficiency. Unfortunately, realistic physical scenarios often lead to less-than-ideal evolutions that demonstrate suboptimal efficiency, nonzero curvature, and a high level of complexity. In this paper, we provide an exact analytical expression for the curvature of a quantum evolution pertaining to a two-level quantum system subjected to various time-dependent magnetic fields. Specifically, we examine the dynamics produced by a two-parameter nonstationary Hermitian Hamiltonian with unit speed efficiency. To enhance our understanding of the physical implications of the curvature coefficient, we analyze the curvature behavior in relation to geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and the complexity of the quantum evolution (as described by the ratio of the difference between accessible and accessed Bloch-sphere volumes for the evolution from initial to final state to the accessible volume for the given quantum evolution). Our findings indicate that, generally, efficient quantum evolutions exhibit lower complexity compared to inefficient ones. However, we also note that complexity transcends mere length. In fact, longer paths that are sufficiently curved can demonstrate a complexity that is less than that of shorter paths with a lower curvature coefficient.

Abstract: Consider quantum channels with input dimension $d_1$, output dimension $d_2$ and Kraus rank at most $r$. Any such channel must satisfy the constraint $rd_2\geq d_1$, and the parameter regime $rd_2=d_1$ is called the boundary regime. In this paper, we show an optimal query lower bound $Ω(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$ for quantum channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$ in the away-from-boundary regime $rd_2\geq 2d_1$, matching the existing upper bound $O(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$. In particular, this lower bound fully settles the query complexity for the commonly studied case of equal input and output dimensions $d_1=d_2=d$ with $r\geq 2$, in sharp contrast to the unitary case $r=1$ where Heisenberg scaling $Θ(d^2/\varepsilon)$ is achievable.

Abstract: Coupling mechanical motion to an optical resonator enables displacement measurements approaching the standard quantum limit (SQL). However, increasing the optomechanical coupling strength will inevitably lead to probing of the nonlinear response of the optical resonator. Thermal intermodulation noise (TIN) arising from the nonlinear mixing of thermomechanical motion can further increase the imprecision well above the SQL and has hitherto been canceled up to second order of nonlinearity via operation at the "magic detuning". In this work, we record the output of a membrane-in-the-middle microcavity system operating at room temperature and achieving high cooperativity, $C>n_\text{th}$, and apply a nonlinear transform that removes all orders of TIN, improving the mechanical signal-to-noise ratio by nearly 10 dB. Our results can be applied to experiments affected by third-order TIN, which we expect to be the dominating intrinsic source of noise in high-cooperativity room-temperature cavity optomechanical systems.

Abstract: Dicke states serve as a critical resource in quantum metrology, communication, and computation. However, unitary preparation of Dicke states is limited to logarithmic depth in standard circuit models and existing constant-depth protocols require measurement and feed-forward. In this work, we present the first unitary, constant-depth protocols for exact Dicke state preparation. We overcome the logarithmic-depth barrier by moving beyond the standard circuit model and leveraging global interactions (native to architectures such as neutral atoms and trapped ions). Specifically, utilizing unbounded CZ gates (i.e. within the QAC$^0$ circuit class), we offer circuits for exact computation of constant-weight Dicke states, using polynomial ancillae, and approximation of weight-1 Dicke states (i.e. $W$ states), using only constant ancillae. Granted additional access to the quantum FAN-OUT operation (i.e. upgrading to the QAC$_f^0$ circuit class), we also achieve exact preparation of arbitrary-weight Dicke states, with polynomial ancillae. These protocols distinguish the constant-depth capabilities of quantum architectures based on connectivity and offer a novel path toward resolving a long-standing quantum complexity conjecture.

Abstract: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current and whose contribution was overlooked in the past. The distinction between different force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the current shift in the spin Hall effect and the correlation-induced quantum torques. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.

Guesses are tracked symbolically and can be eliminated by restrictive checks, giving a tunable tradeoff between complexity and performance via a guessing budget: an unconstrained budget recovers Maximum-Likelihood (ML) performance, while a constant budget yields linear-time decoding and approximates ML. We provide theoretical guarantees on asymptotic performance and demonstrate strong performance on bivariate bicycle and quantum Tanner codes.

Abstract: We analyze the dispersion of collective modes in a superconductor with $d-$wave symmetry of the order parameter in the presence of long-range Coulomb interaction. We use diagrammatic technique and quasiclassical theory in Keldysh-Nambu formalism to compute longitudinal and transverse pair susceptibilities and extract from them the dispersion of the longitudinal and transverse collective mode. We show that at T=0, the dispersion of the transverse (plasma) mode is the same as in an s-wave superconductor, but at a finite temperature it is softer and has a much larger decay rate due to the partial screening of the Coulomb potential by nodal quasiparticles. We show that the dispersion of the longitudinal mode depends on the direction of momentum with respect to the positions of the nodes of the d-wave gap, while the decay rate of this mode does not depend on momentum. We discuss experimental implications of our results.

Abstract: We investigate the emergence of superconducting phases, both with zero and finite Cooper-pair center of mass momenta, in recently proposed unconventional $p$-wave magnets. As a consequence, we find that, while these magnetic phases are in principle compatible with a conventional pairing state at zero field, a Fulde-Ferrell phase can generally be promoted as the leading instability under the application of a finite magnetic field. Interestingly, by calculating the efficiency of the superconducting diode effect of this finite momentum pairing state via a Ginzburg-Landau theory, we uncover that a high efficiency can be obtained in these systems for experimentally relevant spin splittings. Therefore, our prediction reveals that the experimental discovery of these new materials represents a promising platform for the construction of energy-efficient logic circuits that can potentially be used, e.g., in the fields of classical and quantum computing.

Abstract: We have examined the electrical behavior of Josephson junctions formed by a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with a Nb sample and a Nb tip, with normal-state resistances Rn varying between 1 kOhm and 10 MOhm. Current-voltage characteristics were obtained as a function of Rn by varying the distance between the tip and sample at temperatures of 50 mK and 1.5 K. Rn decreases as the tip-sample separation is reduced, and the junction evolves from a phase-diffusion regime to an underdamped small junction regime, and then to a point contact regime. The subgap structure exhibits pronounced multiple Andreev reflection (MAR) features whose amplitudes and onset energies depend sensitively on junction transparency and gap asymmetry. To interpret these spectra, we generalize the Averin-Bardas MAR theory to superconductors with unequal gap magnitudes, providing a quantitative model appropriate for asymmetric STM junctions. The resulting fits yield the superconducting gaps of the electrodes, barrier transparency, and number of conduction channels as a function of Rn. Combining this analysis with Josephson junction dynamics, we further account for the observed switching and retrapping currents and the finite resistance of the supercurrent branch. Our results demonstrate that incorporating intrinsic electrode asymmetry is essential for reliably extracting transport parameters in STM-based superconducting weak links.

Abstract: For the accelerator magnets of the next hadron collider, reducing superconductor persistent-current magnetization is not only important for achieving the desired field quality, but also crucial for its sustainability because the magnetization loss is the major heat load to the magnet cold mass. For conventional Nb3Sn conductors this requires reduction of effective subelement size (Deff). For the restacked-rod-process (RRP) conductors a physical subelement size (Dsub) as small as 35 um (corresponding to a Deff close to 45 um) can be reached, but at a significant price in Jc. Another way to reduce the magnetization is by introducing artificial pinning centers (APC) using the internal oxidation approach. APC conductors outperform conventional Nb3Sn wires in two aspects: 1) higher Jc at high fields, and 2) much lower Jc and magnetization at low fields (e.g., below 5 T). In this work we explored the fabricability of APC wires with small Dsub. A 180-stack APC wire was produced and drawn to 0.7- and 0.5-mm diameters with good quality, with Dsubs of 34 and 24 um (Deffs of 36 and 25 um), respectively. For the 34-um-Dsub wire, its non-Cu Jc is higher than that of an RRP wire used for the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project above 13 T (e.g., 36% higher at 4.2 K, 18 T), while its non-Cu magnetization at 1 T, ΔM(1 T), is only 29% of the RRP wire. Its non-Cu hysteresis loss for a cycle between 1 and 14 T, Qh(1-14 T), is 37% of the RRP wire. For the 24-um-Dsub wire, its non-Cu Jc surpasses the HL-LHC RRP wire above 17.5 T, while its ΔM(1 T) and Qh(1-14 T) are only 17% and 23% of the RRP wire, respectively. Its non-Cu Qh(+/-3 T) even meets the specification of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project.

Abstract: Superconductivity in sulfur superhydride H$_{3}$S under extreme pressures has been explained theoretically, but it requires a peaked concentration of the electronic density of states (DOS), which has been found in first-principles calculations. The mechanism of this peak formation, though vital for its high transition temperature, has however remained obscure. We address this problem through detailed analysis of the first-principles electronic wave functions. The valence wave functions are shown to be significantly plane-wave-like. From the Fourier-mode analysis of the self-consistent potential and atomic pseudopotentials, we extract the nearly uniform models that accurately reproduce the first-principles band structure with very few parameters. The DOS peak is shown to be the consequence of the hybridization of specific plane waves. Adjacency of Jones' large zone to the plane-wave spherical Fermi surface is posited to be the root cause of the multiple plane-wave hybridization, the DOS peak formation and its proximity to the Fermi level. The present theory resolves the minimal modeling problem of electronic states in H$_{3}$S, as well as establishes a mechanism that may help to boost the transition temperatures in pressure induced superconductors.

Abstract: We investigate the polar Kerr and Faraday effects in two-dimensional multiband chiral superconductors. We show that the clapping modes--the relative phase and amplitude oscillations between two chiral components of the superconducting order parameter--lie well within the quasiparticle excitation gap in multiband systems and dominate these magneto-optical responses in the microwave regime. The Kerr and Faraday rotation angles exhibit the resonant enhancement with sign reversals in the microwave regime as a function of the light frequency, reaching peak values on the order of 100 nrad--10 $μ$rad in thin films of candidate chiral superconductors. These resonances are accessible in superconducting atomic layer materials and provide a generic probe of chiral superconductivity in two-dimensional systems.

Abstract: We report the growth and physical properties of single-crystalline Bi$_2$Ta$_3$S$_6$ crystallizing in $P6_3/mcm$ space group, which comprises alternating Ta-S layers and Bi layers with each Bi atom connected with adjacent S atoms. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity measurements reveal a superconducting transition at 0.84 K, with upper critical field 231 Oe under an out-of-plane magnetic field. The magnetization measurements confirm its nature as a type-II superconductor, with anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau parameter $κ_{ab}$ = 7.67 and $κ_c$ = 4.50. Hall measurements indicate the dominant carriers as hole. Hydrostatic pressure is applied, under which both the superconducting transition temperature and upper critical field increase sharply under low pressure before undergoing slight suppression under higher pressure. Density functional theory calculations reveal non-trivial topological surface states on (100) surface in Bi$_2$Ta$_3$S$_6$, which may offer a new avenue for exploring potential topological superconductivity in layered transition metal dichalcogenides.

Abstract: Fascination with the concept of superconducting (SC) {\it superfluid density} $ρ_s$ has persisted since the beginning of superconductivity theory, with numerical values of an actual density rarely provided. Over time $ρ_s$, addressed mostly in cuprate and following high temperature superconductors, has become synonymous with the normalized (unitless) inverse square of the magnetic penetration depth $λ_L$ (the London expression, with superfluid density denoted $n_s$), with interest primarily on its temperature $T$ dependence that is expected to reflect the T-dependence of the SC gap amplitude and gap symmetry. In conventional superconductors, generalized expressions from the London penetration depth via Ginzburg-Landau theory, then to BCS theory provide updated pictures of the supercurrent density-vector potential relationship. The BCS value $λ_{band}$ is distinct from any particle density, instead involving particle availability at the Fermi surface and Fermi velocity as the determining factors, thus providing a basis for a more fundamental theory and understanding of what is being probed in penetration depth studies. The number density of superconducting electrons ${\cal N}_s(T$=0) -- the scalar SC {\it condensate density} -- is provided, first from a phenomenological estimate but then supported by BCS theory. A straightforward relation connecting ${\cal N}_s(0)$ to the density of dynamically transporting carriers in the normal state at $T_c$ is obtained. Numerical values of relevant material parameters including $λ_{band}$ and ${\cal N}_s$ are provided for a few conventional SCs.

Abstract: The phase mode of a superconductor's order parameter encodes fundamental information about pairing and dissipation, but is typically inaccessible at low frequencies due to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Superconducting samples thinner than the London penetration depth, however, support a gapless phase mode whose dispersion can be reshaped by a proximal screening layer. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that this screened phase mode in a superconducting thin film integrated into on-chip terahertz circuitry naturally forms a superconducting microcavity that hosts resonant finite-momentum standing waves of supercurrent density, which we term Cooper plasmons. We measure two Cooper plasmons in a superconducting NbN microcavity and demonstrate that their resonance frequencies and linewidths independently report the density of participating carriers and plasmon's dissipation at finite momenta. Our results reveal an emergent collective mode of an integrated superconductor-circuit system and establish design principles for engineering or suppressing Cooper plasmons in superconducting terahertz devices and circuits.

Abstract: Weyl degeneracies in spectra of magnetoplasma waves enable nonreciprocal energy flow and topologically protected modes, yet conventional materials require impractical magnetic fields to operate. Developing an effective Hamiltonian framework for magnetic Weyl semimetals, we show that these systems overcome the limit, hosting Weyl magnetoplasma physics at zero field due to their giant intrinsic anomalous Hall response. The resulting topology supports nonreciprocal modes localized at magnetic domain walls, including a pair of topological "Fermi-arc-like modes and additional bound states. These effects are fully developed across a broad THz window, and we propose feasible experimental routes for their detection.

Abstract: We report microwave spectroscopy of Josephson junctions chains made from an epitaxial Al/InAs heterostructure. The chains exhibit superinductance, with characteristic wave impedance exceeding $R_{Q} = \hbar/(2e)^{2}$. The planar nature of the junctions results in a large plasma frequency, with no measurable deviations from ideal dispersion up to $12~\mathrm{GHz}$. Internal quality factors decrease sharply with frequency, which we describe with a simple loss model. The possibility of a loss mechanism intrinsic to the superconductor-semiconductor junction is considered.

Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems host exotic transport regimes that are distinct from those found in periodic or disordered lattices. In this work, we study quantum transport in the Aubry-André-Harper lattice in a two-terminal setup coupled to zero-temperature reservoirs, where the conductance is evaluated via the nonequilibrium Green's function method. In the extended phase, we uncover a universal subdiffusive transport when the bath chemical potential aligns with the band edges. Specifically, the typical conductance displays a scaling of $\mathcal{G}_{\text{typ}}\sim L^{-2}$ with system size $L$. We attribute this behavior to the emergence of an exceptional point (Jordan normal form) in the transfer matrix in the thermodynamic limit. In the localized phase, the conductance shows exponential decay governed by the Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, in the critical phase, we identify pronounced log-periodic oscillations of the conductance as a function of system size, arising from the discrete scale invariance inherent to the singular-continuous spectrum. We further extend our analysis to the generalized Aubry-André-Harper model and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the exact mobility edge resides within a finite spectral gap. This results in a counter-intuitive exponential suppression of conductance precisely at the mobility edge. Our work highlights the distinct transport behaviors in quasiperiodic systems and elucidates how they are rigorously dictated by the underlying local spectral structure.

Abstract: Bright electroluminescence (EL) from dopant-free ambipolar lateral p-n junctions in GaAs/AlGaAs single heterointerface (SH) heterostructures is used to probe neutral free excitons arising from two-dimensional electron and hole gases (2DEGs and 2DHGs). The EL spectra reveal both the heavy-hole neutral free exciton (X$^0$) and the high-energy free exciton of the H band (HE). A combination of transition energies, lifetimes, spatial emission profiles, and temperature dependences points to a predominantly two-dimensional character for these excitons at the SH. For X$^0$, the EL peak energies (1515.5-1515.7 meV) lie slightly above the corresponding bulk GaAs photoluminescence (PL) line at 1515.3 meV, while time-resolved measurements yield markedly shorter lifetimes for EL than for PL (337 ps vs. 1610 ps), consistent with recombination in a confined interfacial layer. The HE exciton exhibits a Stark blueshift under forward bias below threshold, and its energies and lifetimes (down to 575 ps) are tuned by the topgate voltage; above threshold, HE emission is quenched in favor of X$^0$. Finally, the tidal effect $-$ a form of pulsed EL generated by swapping the topgate voltage polarity in ambipolar field-effect transistors $-$ produces an X$^0$ line at the same energy as in the lateral p-n junction and reproduces the characteristic nonmonotonic frequency dependence of the brightness previously observed in quantum-well heterostructures, again indicating a 2D-like origin. Taken together, these results show electrically generated and controllable 2D-like excitons (HE and X$^0$), thereby bridging 2D exciton physics and 2DEG/2DHG platforms in dopant-free GaAs/AlGaAs SH devices.

Abstract: We address the spatially nonlocal dielectric functions of graphene at any frequency derived starting fromthe first principles of thermal quantum field theory using the formalism of the polarization tensor. After a brief review of this formalism, the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions are considered at any relationship between the frequency and the wave vector. The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.

Abstract: Plasmons are collective oscillations of mobile electrons. Using terahertz spacetime metrology, we probe plasmon dynamics of mono- and bi-layer graphene. In both systems, the experimentally measured Drude weight systematically exceeds the prediction based on non-interacting electronic system. This enhancement is most pronounced at ultra-low carrier densities. We attribute the observed deviation to pseudospin dynamics of the Dirac fermions in multi-layer graphene, which leads to a breakdown of Galilean invariance. Our results establish that pseudospin structure of the single-particle electronic wave function can directly govern collective excitations, with implications that extend beyond graphene to a broad class of quantum materials.

Abstract: Advances in the next generation of mesoscopic electronics require an understanding of topological phases in inhomogeneous media and the principles that govern them. Motivated by the nature of motifs available in printable conducting inks, we introduce and study quantum transport in a minimal model that describes a bundle of one-dimensional metallic wires that are randomly interconnected by semiconducting chains. Each of these interconnects is represented by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, which can reside in either a trivial or a topological phase. Using a tight-binding approach, we show that such a system can transit from an insulating phase to a robust metallic phase as the interconnects undergo a transition from a trivial to a topological phase. In the latter, despite the random interconnectedness, the metal evades Anderson localization and exhibits a ballistic conductance that scales linearly with the number of wires. We show that this behavior originates from hopping renormalization in the wire network. The zero-energy modes of the topological interconnects act as effective random dimers, giving rise to an energy-dependent localization length that diverges as $\sim 1/E^2$. Our work establishes that random networks provide a yet-unexplored platform to host intriguing phases of topological quantum matter.

Abstract: Two-dimensional polyaramids exhibit strong hydrogen bonding to create molecularly thin nanosheets analogous to graphene. Here, we report the first nanomechanical resonators made out of a two-dimensional polyaramid, 2DPA-1, with thicknesses as small as 8 nm. To fabricate these molecular-scale resonators, we transferred nanofilms of 2DPA-1 onto chips with previously etched arrays of circular microwells. We then characterized the thermal resonances of these resonators under different conditions. When there is no residual gas inside the 2DPA-1-covered microwells, the eigenfrequencies are well-described by a tensioned plate theory, providing the Young's modulus and tension of the 2DPA-1 nanofilms. With gas present, the nanofilms bulge up and mechanical resonances are modified due to the adhesion, bulging and slack present in the system. The fabrication and mechanical characterization of these first 2DPA-1 nanomechanical resonators represent a convincing path toward molecular-scale polymeric NEMS with high mechanical strength, low density, and synthetic processability.

Abstract: The dynamic motion of topological defects in magnets induces an emergent electric field, as exemplified by the continuous flow of skyrmion vortices. However, the electrodynamics underlying this emergent field remains poorly understood. In this context, magnetic domain walls - one dimensional topological defects with two collective modes, sliding and spin tilt - offer a promising platform for exploration. Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. These devices exhibit exceptionally strong domain wall scattering and a pronounced emergent electric field, observed in the imaginary component of the complex impedance. Spin dynamics simulations reveal that domain wall sliding dominates over spin tilting, where the phase delay of the domain wall motion with respect to the driving force impacts the emergent electric field. Our findings establish domain-wall dynamics as a platform for studying emergent electromagnetic fields and motivate further investigations on the coupled motion of magnetic solitons and conduction electrons.

Abstract: Extracting the complete quantum geometric and topological character of Bloch wavefunctions from experiments remains a challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we resolve this by introducing the "wavefunction form factor" (WFF) matrix, a quantity directly constructible from intensities in momentum- and energy-resolved spectroscopies like ARPES and INS. We demonstrate that band topology is encoded in "spectral nodes" -- momentum-space points where the WFF determinant vanishes, providing a direct readout of topological invariants via a topological selection rule. Furthermore, when the number of independent probes exceeds the number of the target bands, our framework yields an effective band projector. This enables the determination of Wilson loop spectra and the extraction of an effective quantum geometric tensor, providing a model-independent measurement of the non-Abelian Berry curvature and quantum metric as resolved by the experimental probes.

Abstract: We report on a new flux quantization phenomenon in metals. We study the response of normal metals to the presence of localized magnetic flux. We find that, due to backreaction effects, the metal traps 0 flux or $\tfrac{h}{2e}$ flux (half flux). We exhibit this effect both for metals pierced by magnetic solenoids and metals wrapping a magnetic solenoid. In the latter case we demonstrate the trapping of magnetic flux analytically. Furthermore, we find that as the solenoid is adiabatically turned off, a logarithmically enhanced localized equilibrium current persists, reflecting perfect defect-diamagnetism of the Fermi gas.

Abstract: The composite Fermi liquid (CFL) in the half-filled Landau level is a cornerstone of the quantum Hall phase diagram. Recent experiments and numerics indicate that an anomalous composite Fermi liquid (ACFL) can also arise at half filling of a Chern band without any external magnetic field, opening new possibilities for paired states of composite fermions beyond the fully gapped Pfaffian phase. We argue that in inversion-asymmetric Chern bands with lattice rotational symmetry reduced to $C_3$, as realized in experimental platforms where signatures of the ACFL have been observed, composite fermions can form a superconductor with neutral gapless Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We term the resulting electronic state {\it the composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid (CBFL)}. This phase has a number of remarkable properties that make it distinct from both the ACFL and the fully gapped Pfaffian. For instance, it is incompressible, has quantized Hall conductance, shows no quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field or doping, and has topological ground state degeneracy on a torus despite the presence of gapless quasiparticles. At the same time, the neutral Bogoliubov Fermi surface yields metallic $T$-linear specific heat, non-quantized thermal conductance, Landau damping of density fluctuations, and a non-analytic $|\mathbf{q}|^3$ contribution to the equal-time structure factor $S(\mathbf{q})$. We also briefly discuss vortex physics and possible fractionalized daughter states induced by doping or external magnetic fields. Our results pave the way for a broader understanding of gapless topological phases arising from paired composite fermions in Chern bands that go beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm.

Abstract: Identifying an appropriate exchange-correlation functional and computational conditions is essential for explaining the fundamental physics of materials and predicting their properties. Here, we investigate the performance of the meta-GGA functionals SCAN and r2SCAN, with and without a Hubbard U, for describing the charge density wave (CDW) in the quasi-one-dimensional material CuTe. By examining the Te-Te bond modulation, phonon dispersions, and electronic structures, we identify clear differences in how the two functionals capture the structural and dynamical properties of the CDW formation. r2SCAN+U reproduces the experimentally observed Te-chain distortions in the CDW phase and the phonon soft mode at qCDW=(0.4, 0.0, 0.5) in the non-CDW phase, whereas SCAN exhibits unphysical phonon behavior. The atomic displacements of the soft mode agree well with the experimental Te modulation. Despite their similar electronic structures and optimized lattice constants, our results demonstrate that r2SCAN is a more suitable choice than SCAN for describing CDW formation and lattice dynamics in CuTe.

Abstract: We perform a systematic study on the effects of electric fields in the Luttinger liquid phase of the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ $K_1J_1Γ_1Γ_1^\prime K_2J_2$ model in the region of ferromagnetic nearest-neighboring Kitaev coupling. We find that while electric fields along $(1,1,1)$-direction maintain the Luttinger liquid behavior, fields along other directions drive the system to a dimerized state. An estimation is made on how effective a $(1,1,1)$-field is for tuning the Luttinger parameter in real materials. Our work is useful for understanding the effects of electric fields in one-dimensional generalized Kitaev spin models, and provides a starting point for exploring the electric-field-related physics in two dimensions based on a quasi-one-dimensional approach.

Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity in Ce-based Kondo-lattice materials emerges almost exclusively in the vicinity of weak dipolar magnetic orders, while higher multipolar orders are only known to occur in a few Pr-based unconventional superconductors and possibly URu$_2$Si$_2$. The multiphase superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ appears to be a notable exception from this trend. Showing clear signatures of magnetism, this tetragonal system is suspected to host a concomitant quadrupolar order, which could be causing the strong enhancement of the ordering temperature when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the fourfold ($c$) axis of the lattice. In this work, we show that the field-temperature phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has a remarkable basal-plane anisotropy. This finding supports the scenario of coupled magnetic and multipolar ordering, which may have implications for the pairing mechanism of the superconductivity, and guides the development of the next iteration of theoretical models.

Abstract: An $S=1$ Haldane chain is a one-dimensional (1D) quantum magnet where strong fluctuations result in quantum disordered singlet ground state with a gapped excitation spectrum. The gap magnitude is primarily set by the dominant intrachain interaction ($J_\text{1D}$). An applied magnetic field closes the gap at $B_\text{c1}$ and drives the system into a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) regime, followed by, at lower temperatures, a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) ground state, persisting up to $B_\text{c2} \propto 4 J_\text{1D}/gμ_B$. Almost all previously studied experimental realizations of such systems were based on transition-metal complexes which typically suffer from intrinsic anisotropies or large $J_\text{1D}$ values, limiting the access to the full theoretical phase diagram. We report a comprehensive study of TLL and BEC phases in the organic Haldane chain system 3,5-bis(N-tert-butylaminoxyl)-3'-nitrobiphenyl (BoNO). The absence of anisotropy and a moderate $J_\text{1D}$ enable exploration of the complete $B-T$ phase diagram. Through $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance, combined with theoretical analysis, we characterize the TLL properties, map the BEC phase boundary $T_c (B)$, determine the associated critical exponent $ν\approx 0.66$ at $B_\text{c2}$, and demonstrate universal quasiparticle scaling in the quantum-critical regime. These results provide full experimental validation of theoretical predictions for field-induced phases in an $S=1$ Haldane chain, made over two decades ago.

Abstract: Charge transfer is a common phenomenon in van der Waals heterostructures with proper work function mismatch, which enables electrostatic gating to control band alignment and interlayer charge distributions. This provides a tunable platform for studying coupled bilayer correlated electronic systems. Here, we theoretically investigate heterostructures of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) and an insulating substrate with gate-tunable band alignment. We first develop a self-consistent electrostatic theory for layer charge densities incorporating charge transfer, which reproduces the experimentally observed broadened and bent charge neutrality region. When the substrate's band edge has a much larger effective mass than RMG, its carriers can form a Wigner crystal at low densities. This creates a quantum superlattice that induces topological flat bands in the RMG layer, which may lead to Chern insulators driven by intralayer Coulomb interactions. Conversely, with comparable effective masses, we find an interlayer excitonic insulator state at charge neutrality stabilized by interlayer Coulomb coupling. Our work establishes these charge-transfer heterostructures as a rich platform for topological and excitonic correlated states, opening an avenue for ``charge-transferonics''.

Abstract: The kagome lattice, a well known example of the geometrically frustrated system, hosts a dispersionless flat band that offers a unique platform for studying correlation-driven quantum phenomena. At appropriate particle concentrations, the existence of a flat band allows a representation of percolation with nontrivial weights. In this work, we investigate the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the repulsive SU($N$) Hubbard model on the kagome lattice within this percolation framework. In this representation, the model can be rigorously mapped to a classical $N$-state site-percolation problem on a triangular lattice, with the SU($N$) symmetry reflected in the nontrivial weights. By large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for SU($3$), SU($4$), and SU($10$) symmetries, we demonstrate that the critical particle concentration for ferromagnetism exceeds the standard percolation threshold and increases with $N$, indicating a strengthening of the effective entropic repulsion.

Abstract: We investigate the role of strong Coulomb interactions beyond the standard Hubbard model in two distinct physical contexts. First, we analyze the superconducting phase transition occurring near the Mott metal-insulator transition. Second, we study transport properties of artificial nano-scale structures containing quantum dots coupled to external electrodes. In both cases, we focus on the impact of the correlated (assisted) hopping (CH) interaction. For superconductors, CH acts as a driving mechanism for the phase transition and modifies the spectral properties of the system. We present the evolution of the spectral function as the system approaches the Mott-type transition under varying model parameters. In quantum-dot-based devices, CH influences the tunneling amplitude between the dot and metallic leads. We demonstrate that the characteristic changes in the conductance of a normal metal-quantum dot-normal metal structure provide a clear signature of the presence and sign of CH interaction.

Abstract: We show a single Landau level (LL) dressed with periodic electrostatic potentials can realize a plethora of interacting topological phases where the Hall conductivity generally does not equal to the LL filling factor. Their physics can be captured by a minimal model of a delta potential lattice within a single LL, realizing exact zero energy Chern bands (denoted as decorated Landau levels or dLL) gapped from dispersive bands with rich geometric properties. With $p/q$ magnetic fluxes per unit cell, there are $q$ dispersive bands and $p-q$ zero energy bands forming the dLL. When the one-body potential strength dominates the electron-electron interaction, band mixing is suppressed and the dispersion bands consist of ``localized states" with vanishing total Chern number. Nevertheless these dispersive bands can have highly nontrivial Berry curvature distribution, and even non-zero Chern numbers when $q>1$. Interestingly even in the limit of large short range interaction, band mixing between dLL and dispersion bands can be strongly suppressed at low filling factor, leading to robust topological phases within the dLL stabilized by the one-body potential. The dLL and the associated dispersive bands can serve as minimal theoretical models for correlated physics in lattice or moire systems; they are also highly tunable experimental platforms for realizing rich phase diagrams of exotic 2D quantum fluids.

Abstract: From numerical simulations it is known that the barrier-crossing time of a non-Markovian one-dimensional reaction coordinate with a single exponentially decaying memory function exhibits a memory-turnover: for intermediate values of the memory decay time the barrier-crossing time is reduced compared to the Markovian limit and for long memory times increases quadratically with the memory time when keeping the total integrated friction and the mass constant. The intermediate memory acceleration regime is accurately predicted by Grote-Hynes theory, for the asymptotic long-memory slow-down behavior no systematic analytically tractable theory is available. Starting from the Green function for a general inertial (i.e. finite-mass) non-Markovian Gaussian reaction coordinate in a harmonic well, we derive by an exact mapping a generalized Fokker-Planck equation with a time-dependent effective diffusion constant. To first order in a systematic cumulant expansion we derive an analytical Arrhenius expression for the barrier-crossing time with the pre-exponential factor given by the energy relaxation time, which can be used to robustly predict barrier-crossing times from simulation or experimental trajectory data of general non-Markovian inertial systems without the need to extract memory functions. For a single exponential memory kernel we give a closed-form expression for the barrier-crossing time, which reproduces the Kramers turnover between the high-friction and high-mass limits as well as the memory turnover from the intermediate memory acceleration to the asymptotic long-memory slow-down regime. We also show that non-Markovian systems are singular in the zero-mass limit, which suggests that the long-memory barrier-crossing slow-down reflects the interplay between mass and memory effects. Thus, physically sound models for non-Markovian systems have to include a finite mass.

Abstract: Catalysis-driven synthetic molecular motors operate in a loose mechanochemical coupling regime, one in which a decomposition of a fuel molecule does not reliably produce a forward step. In that regime, stochastic backward steps can significantly degrade the motor's current, prompting us to ask whether mechanically coupling multiple such motors can boost their averaged current. By simulating rotaxane-based motors with two classes of models--particle-based nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and jump-diffusion models--we show that current boosts are physically achievable. Our observed boosts, which amplify current by single-digit factors, emerge when coupling between motors can increase the activity, speeding up the rate of both forward and backward steps. In doing so, the bias for preferring forward steps actually degrades, but the lost bias can be largely recovered by raising the fuel concentration, demonstrating a general design strategy: amplify activity through coupling and restore bias through stronger driving.

Abstract: We study stochastic transport of interacting particles on a disordered network described by the random comb geometry. The model is defined on a one-dimensional backbone from which branches of random lengths emanate, providing a minimal model of percolation networks beyond the critical percolation probability. The dynamics obeys local detailed balance with respect to a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian containing both an external bias and on-site repulsion. This choice yields an analytically tractable steady state through a mapping to the zero-range-process. We compute the backbone current, branch density profiles, and macroscopic drift velocity, and analyze how bias and interactions compete to shape transport. The backbone current increases monotonically with density, while the drift velocity displays a non-monotonic dependence on the external field, remaining finite for any nonzero bias, in contrast to the vanishing drift velocity of noninteracting particles beyond a threshold bias. Density profiles along branches exhibit stepwise plateaus governed by the ratio of interaction to bias energy. These results highlight how repulsive interactions suppress trapping and restore transport in disordered geometries, bridging earlier studies of field induced drift in random networks with the physics of disordered Bose-Hubbard systems.

Abstract: Memory effects are essential for dynamics of condensed materials and are responsible for non-exponential relaxation of correlation functions of dynamic variables through the memory function. Memory functions of dipole rotations for polar liquids have never been calculated. We present here calculations of memory functions for single-dipole rotations and for the overall dipole moment of the sample for SPC/E water. The memory functions for single-particle and collective dipole dynamics turn out to be nearly identical. This result validates theories of dielectric spectroscopy in terms of single-particle time correlation functions and the connection between the collective and single-particle relaxation times through the Kirkwood factor. The dielectric function in this formalism contains no new dynamic information that does not exist in the single-dipole correlation function. A short memory time, $\lesssim 1$ fs, justifies the use of rotational diffusion model to describe dynamics of a single molecular dipole moment in bulk water.

Abstract: Quantum chaotic systems exhibit certain universal statistical properties that closely resemble predictions from random matrix theory (RMT). With respect to observables, it has recently been conjectured that, when truncated to a sufficiently narrow energy window, their statistical properties can be described by an unitarily invariant ensemble, and testable criteria have been introduced, which are based on the scaling behavior of free cumulants. In this paper, we investigate the conjecture numerically in translationally invariant Heisenberg spin chains with spin quantum number $S =\frac{1}{2},1,\frac{3}{2}$. Combining a quantum-typicality-based numerical method with the exploitation of the system's symmetries, we study the spin current operator and find clear evidence of consistency with the proposed criteria in chaotic cases. Our findings further support the conjecture of the existence of RMT universality as manifest in the observable properties in quantum chaotic systems.

Abstract: The impact of disorder on collective phenomena depends crucially on whether it is quenched or annealed. In synchronization problems, quenched disorder in higher dimensional Kuramoto models is known to produce unconventional dimensional effects, including a striking odd even dichotomy: synchronization transitions are continuous in even dimensions and discontinuous in odd dimensions. By contrast, the impact of annealed disorder has received comparatively little attention. Here we study a D dimensional Kuramoto model with both fundamental and higher-harmonic interactions under annealed disorder, and develop an arbitrary dimensional center-manifold framework to analyze the nonlinear dynamics near the onset of collective behavior. We show that annealed disorder fundamentally alters the role of dimensionality. With fundamental coupling alone, it completely removes the odd even dichotomy, yielding continuous synchronization transitions with universal mean-field scaling in all dimensions. Higher-harmonic interactions preserve this universality while rendering the synchronization transition tunable between continuous and discontinuous. At the same time, they give rise to a novel, correlation-driven transition between a symmetry-protected incoherent phase and a symmetry broken state lacking global synchronization, which is therefore invisible to the conventional Kuramoto order parameter. This transition is continuous in two dimensions but discontinuous in higher dimensions, revealing an emergent and previously-unrecognized special role of two dimensions.
