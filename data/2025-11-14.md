### [1] [Green Function Invariants for Floquet Topological Superconductivity Induced by Proximity Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09650)
*Mohamed Assili,Panagiotis Kotetes*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A Green function approach is proposed to predict Floquet topological phases in driven superconductor-semiconductor hybrids, addressing level broadening effects and enabling accurate calculation of topological invariants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the inadequacy of treating the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir under driving conditions due to level broadening. The paper aims to address this limitation by developing a method to accurately predict Floquet topological phases in such systems.

Method: The method involves obtaining midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and deriving level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part onto quasi-energy eigenvectors. This is demonstrated using a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field.

Result: The results include the Floquet band structure, level broadenings, and topological invariants for the studied system. The analysis confirms that broadening effects can hinder the observation of certain topological phases, especially those involving Majorana π modes.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the importance of properly accounting for the self-energy in driven superconductor-semiconductor hybrids, as broadening effects can obscure the observation of Floquet topological phases, particularly those with Majorana π modes. The proposed Green function approach successfully predicts these phases by constructing Floquet topological invariants.

Abstract: We bring forward a Green function approach for the prediction of Floquet topological phases in driven superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. Although it is common to treat the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir, it was recently pointed out that such an approximation breaks down in the presence of driving, due to the emergence of level broadening. Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $π$ modes.

TL;DR: A new electron interferometer enables phase measurement in quantum materials, revealing hidden electronic properties and offering optical control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inaccessibility of the phase of electronic wavefunctions in crystals, which obscures rich electronic information.

Method: A quantum-path electron interferometer based on time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy was developed, enabling phase reconstruction with energy and momentum resolution.

Result: The interferometer resolved the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a topological insulator, revealing phase jumps and helicity, and demonstrated optical control via light polarization.

Conclusion: The development of the quantum-path electron interferometer has successfully addressed the challenge of measuring the phase of electronic states in quantum materials, opening new frontiers in quantum materials research.

Abstract: The electronic wavefunction is at the heart of physical phenomena, defining the frontiers of quantum materials research. While the amplitude of the electron wavefunction in crystals can be measured with state-of-the-art probes in unprecedented resolution, its phase has remained largely inaccessible, obscuring rich electronic information. Here we develop a quantum-path electron interferometer based on time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that enables the reconstruction of the phase of electronic states in quantum materials - with energy and momentum resolution. We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram. This photo-electron-interferometer is a purely experimental scheme and does not rely on any specific theoretical model. It can be extended to a variety of materials, opening up the phase dimension in quantum materials research.

*Shaofeng Huang,Yu-Peng Wang,Jie Ren,Chen Fang*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A new class of models for superdiffusion in quantum materials is proposed, validated by simulations, and linked to experimental signatures like linear resistivity and divergent conductivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the challenge of experimentally observing superdiffusion due to its reliance on fine-tuned artificial Hamiltonians. The aim is to propose a broader class of models achievable in condensed matter systems.

Method: The method involves deriving a universal scaling law for conductance and validating it through numerical simulations on models like graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals.

Result: The results include a universal scaling law for conductance, validated numerical simulations, and predictions of experimentally verifiable signatures like linear-in-temperature resistivity and divergent optical conductivity.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the proposed framework provides a practical route for discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials, supported by numerical validation and experimental signatures.

Abstract: Superdiffusion is an anomalous transport behavior. Recently, a new mechanism, termed the ``nodal mechanism," has been proposed to induce superdiffusion in quantum models. However, existing realizations of the nodal mechanism have so far been proposed on fine-tuned, artificial Hamiltonians, posing a significant challenge for experimental observation. In this work, we propose a broad class of models for generating superdiffusion potentially realizable in condensed matter systems across different spatial dimensions. A robust nodal structure emerges from the hybridization between the itinerant electrons and the local impurity orbitals, protected by the intrinsic symmetry and topology of the electronic band. We derive a universal scaling law for the conductance, $G \sim L^{-γ}$, revealing how the exponent is dictated by the dimensionality of the nodal structure ($D_{\text{node}}$) and its order $n$, and the dimensionality of the system $(D)$ at high temperatures or that of the Fermi surface ($D^F$) at low temperatures. Through numerical simulations, we validate these scaling relations at zero temperature for various models, including those based on graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals, finding excellent agreement between our theory and the computed exponents. Beyond the scaling of conductance, our framework predicts a suite of experimentally verifiable signatures, notably a new mechanism for linear-in-temperature resistivity ($ρ\sim T$) and a divergent low-frequency optical conductivity ($σ(ω) \sim ω^{γ-1}$), establishing a practical route to discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials.

Conclusion: 非局域量子几何指标为理解和预测拓扑相变的稳定性提供了一种更高效和通用的工具。

Abstract: Spatially resolved local quantum geometric markers play a crucial role in the diagnosis of topological phases without long-range translational symmetry, including amorphous systems. Here, we focus on the nonlocality of such markers. We demonstrate that they behave as correlation functions independently of the material's structure, showing sharp variations in the vicinity of topological transitions and exhibiting a unique pattern in real space for each transition. Notably, we find that, even within the same Altland-Zirnbauer class, distinct topological transitions generate qualitatively different spatial signatures, enabling a refined, class-internal probe of topological stability. As such, nonlocal quantum geometric indicators provide a more efficient and versatile tool to understand and predict the stability of topological phase transitions.

Abstract: The performance and scalability of two-dimensional (2D) field-effect transistors (FETs) are strongly influenced by geometry-defined electrostatics. In most 2D FET studies, the gate overlaps with the source and drain electrodes, allowing the gate potential to modulate the 2D semiconductor underneath the electrodes and ultimately effect carrier transport at the metal-semiconductor interface - a phenomenon known as contact gating. Here, a symmetric dual-gate structure with independently addressable back and top gates is employed to elucidate the impact of contact gating on a monolayer MoS2 channel. Unlike previous studies of contact gating, this symmetric structure enables quantification of the phenomena through a contact gating factor, revealing a 2x enhancement in on-state performance in long-channel devices. At scaled dimensions (50 nm channel and 30 nm contact length), the influence of contact gating becomes amplified, yielding a 5x increase in on-state performance and a 70% reduction in transfer length when contact gating is present. Since many reported record-performance 2D FETs employ back-gate geometries that inherently include contact gating, these results establish contact gating as a critical and previously underappreciated determinant of device performance in the 2D FET landscape.

Result: Clear peaks in differential resistance at the resonant frequency of SAW device were observed, revealing distinct features in Shapiro steps and the significant role of strain.

Conclusion: The study highlights the significant role of strain in charge density wave materials and suggests potential applications for strain-induced devices.

Abstract: Recent development in nanotechnology has enabled us to investigate the dynamic properties of van der Waals materials on a piezoelectric substrate. Here we report on the dynamics of charge density wave (CDW) in NbSe$_{3}$ nanowires induced by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). Clear peaks in the differential resistance were observed at the resonant frequency of the SAW device. These peaks known as Shapiro steps are typically observed by applying an rf current to NbSe$_{3}$ nanowires. We found that the Shapiro steps induced by SAWs show several distinct features from the ones induced by an rf current. Our detailed study revealed that a strain induced by SAWs plays a significant role in the Shapiro steps. The result clearly demonstrates the importance of the strain in CDW materials and paves the way for strain-induced device applications.

TL;DR: The study demonstrates that tuning the spin-orbit field direction in semiconductor nanowires can significantly enhance thermoelectric properties, violating the Wiedemann-Franz law and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how the thermoelectric properties of semiconductor nanowires with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling can be controlled by tuning the misalignment angle between spin-orbit directions.

Method: A scattering-matrix approach applied to a tight-binding model of the nanowire.

Result: Significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, strong enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and the $ZT$ figure of merit when RSOC vectors are antiparallel, and the Zeeman gap determines the optimal energy window for doping and temperatures.

Conclusion: Controlling the spin-orbit field direction is a promising method to optimize the thermoelectric response in quantum-coherent semiconducting nanowire devices.

Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires (NWs) with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), when exposed to a suitably applied Zeeman field, exhibit one-dimensional helical channels with a spin orientation locked to the propagation direction within the magnetic energy gap. Here, by adopting a scattering-matrix approach applied to a tight-binding model of the NW, we demonstrate that the thermoelectric (TE) properties can be widely controlled by tuning the misalignment angle $φ$ between the spin-orbit directions of two NW segments. In particular, when the RSOC vectors are antiparallel (Dirac paradox configuration) we predict a significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, and a strong enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and the $ZT$ figure of merit. We also show that the Zeeman gap determines the optimal energy window for doping and temperatures. These results suggest that controlling the spin-orbit field direction, which can be achieved with suitably applied wrap gates, is a promising alternative for tuning and optimizing the TE response in quantum-coherent semiconducting NW devices.

TL;DR: Researchers demonstrated moiré-engineered insulating states in 1D vdW systems using SWNT/hBN alignment, uncovering new quantum behaviors with potential applications in low-dimensional materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to extend moiré engineering from 2D to 1D vdW systems, a previously challenging endeavor, to uncover new quantum states and insulating behaviors.

Method: The authors employed low-temperature electrical transport measurements, density functional theory (DFT), and tight-binding calculations to analyze the electronic properties of armchair SWNT/hBN heterostructures.

Result: Pronounced insulating states were observed at charge neutrality point (CNP), full, and half moiré fillings in lattice-aligned armchair SWNT/hBN heterostructures, absent in non-aligned devices. Theoretical calculations confirmed band gaps at CNP and full fillings but suggested that correlations or phonon interactions might explain the half-filling gaps.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates moiré-engineered electronic insulating states in a 1D moiré superlattice using an armchair SWNT aligned with an hBN substrate. It reveals that 1D moiré effects can induce insulating states at CNP, full, and half moiré fillings, with potential contributions from electron correlation or electron-phonon interactions. This work opens new avenues for exploring quantum phases in 1D vdW materials.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) moiré superlattices have provided a powerful knob to engineer a plethora of new quantum states. However, extending such moiré engineering to one-dimensional (1D) vdW systems has remained challenging. Here we report the moiré-engineered electronic insulating states in a new 1D moiré superlattice, by crystallographically aligning an armchair single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) to 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Remarkably, we observe the emergence of pronounced insulating states at charge neutrality point (CNP), full and half moiré fillings in lattice-aligned armchair SWNT/hBN heterostructures by low-temperature electrical transport measurements. In strong contrast, armchair SWNT devices without hBN alignment do not show any of these insulating behaviors, providing compelling evidence for the significant 1D moiré effect. Our density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding calculations reveal that synergetic nanotube partial flattening and in-plane lattice reconstruction at 1D moiré interface expand the most stable AB' stacking regions (carbon on top of boron) and open sizable band gaps at both CNP and full moiré fillings at the single-particle level. Our one-body theory predicts no band gaps at half moiré fillings, suggesting that electron correlation and/or electron-phonon interaction may give rise to these emergent insulating behaviors in our 1D moiré systems. Our work establishes a new and definite moiré engineering route for 1D vdW materials and opens an exciting avenue for exploring interaction-induced quantum phases in 1D.

Motivation: To investigate the magnetotransport properties of a system with unconventional Rashba spin-orbit coupling, focusing on the effects of chiral spin texture and Landau level crossings.

Method: Analytical derivation of Landau levels and computation of longitudinal and quantum Hall conductivity using the Kubo formalism based on linear response theory.

Result: Observation of spin-polarized Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and beating patterns in intra-spin branches, along with double jumps in quantum Hall conductivity due to Landau level crossings.

Conclusion: The study reveals unique magnetotransport properties in a two-dimensional electronic system with unconventional Rashba spin-orbit coupling, including spin-polarized Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and Landau level crossing effects in quantum Hall conductivity.

Abstract: We study the magnetotransport properties of a two-dimensional electronic system with unconventional Rashba spin-orbit coupling in which the system is described by a pair of chiral spin texture in each spin branch, and the chirality is opposite in two spin branches. We obtain the Landau levels analytically and find that intra-spin and/or inter-spin Landau level crossing occurs. We compute the longitudinal conductivity and quantum Hall conductivity using the Kubo formalism based on linear response theory. We find that the usual Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation in longitudinal conductivity appears that can be made purely spin polarized by adjusting the Fermi level suitably. We observe a beating pattern in the Shubnikov-de Hass oscillation in the intra-spin branches, which arises due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to two bands in each spin branch. This is contrary to the conventional Rashba system, where such beating is due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to the two spin-branches. On the other hand, we note that quantum-Hall conductivity exhibits usual quantization in units of $e^2/h$ corresponding to each spin dependent Landau level. However, the Landau level crossing gives rise to the double jump in the Hall conductivity if the Fermi level is placed precisely at the crossing point.

Conclusion: 有机自由基材料在高于尼尔温度时仍能保持长程相干性，为有机电子学、高密度信息存储和量子技术开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Materials are commonly distinguished by their magnetic response into diamagnetic, paramagnetic, and magnetically ordered (ferro-, ferri-, and antiferromagnetic) phases. Diamagnets and paramagnets lack spontaneous long-range order, whereas ordered magnets develop such order below their Curie or Néel temperature and support single spin-wave excitations (magnons). Magnons have found applications in radio-frequency technologies and computation, magneto-optics, and foundational quantum experiments. Above the Curie/Néel temperature, long-range order is lost and the material transitions to a paramagnetic phase, with localised spin alignment in small patches, producing paramagnons with only short-range propagation. Here we show that long-range coherence is preserved in the organic free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl above the Néel temperature using all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy in external magnetic fields. We observe coherently excited low-energy paramagnon-polaritons up to $\mathbf{23\,\mathrm{GHz}}$ , propagating over $\mathbf{8\,\mathrm{mm}}$ at supersonic group velocities exceeding $\mathbf{100\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}}$. Using free radicals as magnon carriers integrates organic materials with spintronics and opens the way to organic electronics, dense information storage, and quantum technologies.

Conclusion: The study successfully describes the interplay between electron hopping and measurement back action, showing their effects in different geometries and providing a framework for analyzing various experimental results.

Abstract: The measurements of Hanle and polarization recovery effects for localized charge carriers are the basic tools for determining parameters of the spin dynamics, such as strength of the hyperfine interaction, for example, in quantum dots. We describe the dependence of the spin polarization of localized electrons on transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields taking into account the interplay between electron hopping and measurement back action. We show that these two have a qualitatively similar effect in the Faraday geometry, but compete in the Voigt geometry. This allows one to describe a broad range of the experimental results and study the fundamental effects of quantum measurements.

Result: Quantitative agreement with experimental AEPSWS on a YIG film confirms the antenna acts as a tunable k-space filter, validating the approach.

Conclusion: The framework for all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy (AEPSWS) links realistic electromagnetic drive fields to micromagnetic dynamics, providing actionable design rules for on-chip magnonic transducers.

Abstract: The excitation and detection of propagating spin waves with lithographed nanoantennas underpin both classical magnonic circuits and emerging quantum technologies. Here, we establish a framework for all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy (AEPSWS) that links realistic electromagnetic drive fields to micromagnetic dynamics. Using finite-element (FE) simulations, we compute the full vector near-field of electrical impedance-matched, tapered coplanar and stripline antennas and import this distribution into finite-difference (FD) micromagnetic solvers. This approach captures the antenna-limited wave-vector spectrum and the component-selective driving fields (perpendicular to the static magnetisation) that simplified uniform-field models cannot. From this coupling, we derive how realistic current return paths and tapering shapes, k-weighting functions, for Damon-Eshbach surface spin waves in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) films are, for millimetre-scale matched CPWs and linear tapers down to nanometre-scale antennas. Validation against experimental AEPSWS on a $48\,nm$ YIG film shows quantitative agreement in dispersion ridges, group velocities, and spectral peak positions, establishing that the antenna acts as a tunable k-space filter. These results provide actionable design rules for on-chip magnonic transducers, with immediate relevance for low-power operation regimes and prospective applications in quantum magnonics.

Abstract: Point defects or impurities can give rise to sharp local modifications in the structure and electronic properties of two-dimensional metals, serving as an intriguing atomic-level solid-state model for both fundamental and application research. In this work, we investigated atomic-scale defects in a two-dimensional silver monolayer intercalated at the interface between epitaxial graphene and SiC using a scanning tunneling microscope. Distinct dark and bright defects are identified as in-plane vacancies and substitutional impurities within the silver monolayer, each hosting a localized electronic state induced solely by the defect. Remarkably, under excitation of tunneling electrons assisted by a negative bias voltage, the defects can hop inelastically which is reminiscent of the hydrogen switching in the cavity of an organic molecule. The hopping can be reversibly controlled by the scanning tunneling microscope tip, allowing the defects to function as atomic-scale two-level conductance switches. Defect hopping further allows us to gain a deeper understanding of their origins and the relationship between dark and bright defect species. This study constitutes a pathway toward understanding and controlling defects in two-dimensional metals with atomic precision, revealing previously unexplored dynamic behavior with potential applications in nanoelectronics.

TL;DR: Interfacial DMI in STT-MRAM causes incoherent switching and ballooning-like WER anomalies; interfacial engineering can improve reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the anomalous non-monotonic increase in write error rate (WER) observed in STT-MRAM during high-speed operations, particularly focusing on the 'ballooning effect'.

Method: Micromagnetic simulations of 20 nm and 50 nm magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) were conducted to investigate the role of DMI on the 'ballooning effect'.

Result: DMI was shown to promote incoherent magnetization reversal, prolong switching time, and create intermediate multidomain states leading to incomplete reversal. These effects reproduce the experimentally observed ballooning-like anomalies under high DMI values, while longer pulses mitigate the issue by allowing stable state formation.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) significantly influences the anomalous switching behavior in STT-MRAM, promoting incoherent magnetization reversal and incomplete reversal states. Interfacial engineering is proposed as a practical strategy to mitigate these effects and enhance device reliability.

Abstract: The performance and reliability of spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory (STT-MRAM) can be compromised by anomalous switching behavior, especially during high-speed operations. One such anomaly, known as the "ballooning effect" is characterized by an unexpected non-monotonic increase in the write error rate (WER) with increase in STT current at specific current pulse durations. In this study, we systematically investigate the role of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on such WER anomaly using micromagnetic simulations of 20 nm and 50 nm magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We show that DMI promotes incoherent magnetization reversal, prolongs the switching time and creates intermediate multidomain states that result in incomplete reversal. At high DMI values, these states persist even under large switching current densities, reproducing ballooning-like anomalies reported experimentally. In contrast, longer pulses overcome these effects by allowing the system sufficient time to reach a stable state. Our findings show that interfacial DMI can play a role in the ballooning effect and point to interfacial engineering as a practical strategy for improving the reliability of next-generation STT-MRAM.

Method: The study employs a classical analysis of skyrmion motion to identify dislocations as shallow traps, followed by a quantum analysis to determine the skymion's quantized states.

Result: The study reveals that dislocations act as shallow traps on magnetic textures and identifies the quantum states of skyrmion motion.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by demonstrating the practical application of its findings in devices that utilize shallow traps from dislocation arrays, enabling controlled motion with low current activation.

Abstract: Topologically secure spin configurations, such as skyrmions and bimerons, offer a compelling alternative to conventional magnetic domains, potentially enabling high-density, low-power spintronic devices. These pseudo-particles, characterized by their swirling spin textures and nontrivial topological charges, are prevalent and notably influence their electronic, magnetic, and mechanical traits. This paper provides an in-depth overview of the interaction between a screw dislocation within a distorted magnetic lattice, exploring possible coupling mechanisms and establishing a promising link between two disparate topics in materials science: topological magnetism and topological elasticity. We first provide a classical analysis of skyrmion motion that reveals the dislocations as shallow traps on the magnetic texture. Afterwards, we provide an analysis of the quantized motion of the skyrmion and identify its quantum states. We conclude by illustrating how the ideas in our paper can be implemented in simple yet compelling devices based on the shallow traps from an array of dislocations acting as frets in a race-track, controlling the motion with a low current activation mechanism.

TL;DR: Altermagnetic CrSb exhibits a novel third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect due to its unique crystalline symmetry, enabling applications in high-frequency electronics and THz devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how the unique symmetry properties of altermagnets, such as non-relativistic spin-splitting, influence their electric material properties and potential technological applications.

Method: The researchers conducted symmetry analyses and model calculations to identify the third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in altermagnetic CrSb, and experimentally demonstrated its utility in a multiple wave mixing device.

Result: Discovery of a broadband third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in altermagnetic CrSb at room temperature, attributed to a Berry curvature quadrupole within its spin-split band structure. This effect was leveraged to create a functional multiple wave mixing device.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the crystalline magnetic order of altermagnets, exemplified by CrSb, uniquely determines their nonlinear electric properties, offering potential applications in high-frequency electronics, THz generation, and communication networks.

Abstract: Crystalline symmetries determine the linear and nonlinear response of materials to external stimuli such as mechanical pressure and electromagnetic fields, governing phenomena such as piezoelectricity, optical activity, and multiple wave mixing with wide ranging technological applications. Altermagnets present a new class of materials with magnetic crystalline order where specific crystal symmetry operations connect antiferromagnetic sublattices, leading to non-relativistic spin-splitting of the electronic band structure. Hence, the electric material properties of altermagnets should uniquely mirror these underlying symmetry properties, potentially giving rise to novel phenomena in response to external driving fields. Here, we report the discovery of a broadband third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in altermagnetic CrSb at room temperature. The comparison of our observations with symmetry analyses and model calculations shows that this nonlinear Hall response is induced by the nonlinear electric susceptibility of a Berry curvature quadrupole, which exists within the spin-split band structure of CrSb and is characterized by the underlying crystalline and magnetic symmetries. We then utilize this third-order nonlinear electric susceptibility of CrSb to realize a multiple wave mixing device with pronounced four wave mixing output, which could, in principle, be extended to THz frequencies. Our study discovers that the crystalline magnetic order of altermagnets determines their nonlinear electric material properties, which could facilitate applications in high-frequency electronics, THz generation, communication networks, and energy harvesting.

Abstract: A recently proposed Boltzmann local equilibrium Wigner function for massive spin-1/2 particles is generalized to the case of Fermi-Dirac statistics. The resulting formula ensures the correct normalization of the mean polarization vector and reproduces the generalized thermodynamic relations with spin that were obtained in earlier studies. Moreover, we show that the macroscopic currents constructed from the Fermi-Dirac Wigner function can be obtained as derivatives of a suitably defined generating function with respect to the Lagrange multipliers (temperature, hydrodynamic flow, and chemical potentials). The identified generating function also indicates that the underlying framework can be classified as a divergence-type theory.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to study the decoherence mechanism of a π-junction qubit and its protection against quasiparticle poisoning.

Method: analysis of the decoherence of a π-junction qubit encoded by two co-located Majorana modes.

Result: frustration is effective against Ohmic noise (s=1) and provides some protection for 0.76<s<1 sub-Ohmic noise, but fails against 1/f noise (s→0), leading to catastrophic decoherence.

Conclusion: the qubit viability depends on the effective environment experienced by the local Majorana wave functions.

Abstract: I analyze the decoherence of a $π$-junction qubit encoded by two co-located Majorana modes. Although not topologically protected, the qubit leverages distinct spatial profiles to couple to two independent environmental baths, realizing the phenomenon of quantum frustration.This mechanism is tested against the threat of quasiparticle poisoning (QP). I show that frustration is effective against Ohmic noise ($s=1$) and has some protection for $0.76<s<1$ sub-Ohmic noise. However, the experimentally prevalent $1/f$ noise ($s\to0$) falls deep within the model's localized phase, where frustration is insufficient. This causes Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and catastrophic decoherence. The qubit's viability depends on what is the effective environment that these local Majorana wave functions experience.

Abstract: We analyze a simple and efficient experimental protocol to cool the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model to low temperatures. The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the less-studied temporal analogue of quantum superposition (Stückelberg interference) in large interacting systems and understand its potential for controlling many-body states.

Method: Experimental manipulation of programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms, comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries.

Result: Achieved controllable vacuum-state freezing with visibility exceeding 70% and excitation suppression to 1% despite periodic driving, showing that dual-frequency modulation enhances interference-driven freezing.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the scalability of temporal interference as a mechanism for Floquet control, enabling predictive many-body state engineering in large quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum superposition famously manifests as spatial interference, epitomized by the double-slit experiment. Its less explored temporal analogue, Stückelberg interference, arises in driven systems where phases accumulated along distinct time-domain pathways recombine. Extending this phenomenon to large interacting systems introduces a new complexity as delicate phase relationships are disrupted by many-body interactions. Here we experimentally achieve controllable vacuum-state freezing in programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms through many-body Stückelberg interference, with visibility exceeding $70\%$ and excitation suppression to $1\%$ despite periodic driving that would typically induce heating. Comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries, we show that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency dramatically enhances interference-driven freezing. Finite-range interaction tails play a decisive role, producing interference patterns which constrained $PXP$ models cannot capture. Our results establish temporal interference as a scalable microscopic mechanism for Floquet control, enabling predictive many-body state engineering in large-scale platforms.

### [21] [A measurement-driven quantum algorithm for SAT: Performance guarantees via spectral gaps and measurement parallelization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09647)
*Franz J. Schreiber,Maximilian J. Kramer,Alexander Nietner,Jens Eisert*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum SAT solver surpassing Grover's quadratic limit is analyzed, with runtime linked to Hamiltonian properties and measurement success. Algorithmic enhancements and polynomial-time performance on some cases are demonstrated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is crucial in theory and practice, but Grover-type quantum methods offer limited quadratic speed-ups. This work seeks to surpass this barrier by exploring alternative quantum approaches with better performance guarantees.

Method: The paper analyzes a measurement-driven quantum SAT solver, focusing on the runtime trade-off between Hamiltonian spectral gap and measurement success probability. It introduces algorithmic improvements like a new readout routine, perfect hash family-based parallelization, and amplitude amplification.

Result: The algorithm's runtime is shown to depend on an exponential trade-off between Hamiltonian spectral gap and measurement success probability, controllable via a tunable rotation angle. Practical utility is demonstrated by collapsing runtime to polynomial for specific SAT instances.

Conclusion: This paper presents a quantum SAT solver that surpasses Grover-type methods, with a runtime dependent on Hamiltonian spectral gap and measurement success probability. Key algorithmic improvements include a new readout routine, measurement parallelization, and amplitude amplification. The framework shows potential for polynomial runtime on certain SAT instances, with an open problem to establish a non-trivial spectral gap lower bound for further optimization.

Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is of central importance in both theory and practice. Yet, most provable guarantees for quantum algorithms rely exclusively on Grover-type methods that cap the possible advantage at only quadratic speed-ups, making the search for approaches that surpass this quadratic barrier a key challenge. In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability. A problem we leave open is to establish a non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap as a function of the rotation angle. Resolving this directly translates into an improved worst-case runtime, potentially realizing a super-quadratic quantum advantage.

Motivation: To explore coherent state transport within degenerate subspaces and energy transfer controlled by non-abelian Berry-curvature.

Method: Utilizes a transitionless geometric quantum drive with a time-dependent Hamiltonian and a counterdiabatic term, implemented via artificial atoms on various platforms.

Result: Energy transfer is determined by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor, with pumping power controlled by initial state and Hamiltonian topology.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump with applications as a quantum transducer, charger, and metrological tool.

Abstract: We introduce a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump realized by a transitionless geometric quantum drive--a time-dependent Hamiltonian supplemented by a counterdiabatic term generated by a prescribed trajectory on a smooth control manifold--that coherently transports states within a degenerate subspace. When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class. We outline an implementation with artificial atoms, which are realizable on various platforms including trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, and semiconductor quantum dots. The resulting energy pump can serve as a quantum transducer or charger, and as a metrological tool for measuring phase coherences in quantum states.

### [23] [Optimal Interpolation of Entanglement Purification Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09657)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Optimizing the selection of entanglement purification protocols via probability distributions improves the trade-off between rate and fidelity, validated in asymptotic and finite-size cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the trade-off between the rate and fidelity in bipartite entanglement purification by proposing a method to optimize the selection of protocols for achieving better performance.

Method: By randomly selecting protocols according to a probability distribution, the authors analyze the trade-off between the rate of producing strongly entangled pairs and their fidelity. They focus on maximizing fidelity for a given rate or vice versa, considering both asymptotic and finite-size scenarios.

Result: The results show that the proposed method can achieve rates and fidelities not attainable by any single protocol, demonstrating its effectiveness in both asymptotic and finite-size settings.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates how to optimize the probability distribution for choosing entanglement purification protocols to maximize either the rate of producing high-fidelity entangled pairs or their fidelity at a given rate. The approach is validated in both asymptotic and finite-size regimes.

Abstract: Bipartite entanglement purification is the conversion of copies of weakly entangled pairs shared between two separated parties into a smaller number of strongly entangled shared pairs using only local operations and classical communication. Choosing between different entanglement purification protocols generally involves weighing up a trade-off between the ratio of strongly entangled pairs produced to weakly entangled pairs consumed, which we call the rate of the protocol, and the degree of the entanglement of the strongly entangled pairs, typically measured by the fidelity of those pairs to maximally entangled states. By randomly choosing a protocol according to a probability distribution over a list of protocols for each pair we want to produce, we can achieve rates and fidelities not achieved by any of the original protocols. Here, we show how to choose this distribution to maximise the rate at which we produce qubit pairs with a given fidelity to a Bell state or, equivalently, to maximise the fidelity to a Bell state of the qubit pairs produced at a given rate. We investigate both the asymptotic case, where the number of initial pairs goes to infinity, and the finite-size regime, where protocols are restricted to a finite number of weakly entangled pairs.

*Arda Aydin,Nicolas Delfosse,Edwin Tham*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: CxC hypergraph product codes (C2 and CxR) outperform existing HGP codes with better error rates and qubit efficiency, enabled by global symmetries and exhaustive search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HGP codes are popular quantum LDPC codes with potential advantages in logical error rates and qubit overhead. Previous optimization methods (e.g., progressive edge growth, random search) used local transformations. This work aims to discover more efficient codes by imposing global symmetries and performing exhaustive searches.

Method: The study focuses on hypergraph product codes constructed from cyclic codes (CxC codes), specifically C2 codes (product of a cyclic code with itself) and CxR codes (product of a cyclic code with a repetition code). An exhaustive search is performed to identify codes with additional global symmetries, avoiding machine learning algorithms.

Result: C2 and CxR codes achieve significantly better parameters and logical error rates (up to three orders of magnitude better) than previously optimized HGP codes. Some C2 codes also outperform state-of-the-art LDPC codes like bivariate bicycle codes in terms of error rate and qubit overhead. An efficient planar layout for trapped ion implementations is also proposed.

Conclusion: Hypergraph product (HGP) codes, specifically CxC codes (including C2 and CxR codes), outperform previously optimized HGP codes by achieving better parameters and a significantly lower logical error rate. Additionally, some C2 codes achieve a lower logical error rate and smaller qubit overhead than state-of-the-art LDPC codes. The cyclic symmetry of these codes enables an efficient planar layout for trapped ion implementations.

Abstract: Hypergraph product (HGP) codes are one of the most popular family of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Circuit-level simulations show that they can achieve the same logical error rate as surface codes with a reduced qubit overhead. They have been extensively optimized by importing classical techniques such as the progressive edge growth, or through random search, simulated annealing or reinforcement learning techniques. In this work, instead of machine learning (ML) algorithms that improve the code performance through local transformations, we impose additional global symmetries, that are hard to discover through ML, and we perform an exhaustive search. Precisely, we focus on the hypergraph product of two cyclic codes, which we call CxC codes and we study C2 codes which are the product a cyclic code with itself and CxR codes which are the product of a cyclic codes with a repetition code. We discover C2 codes and CxR codes that significantly outperform previously optimized HGP codes, achieving better parameters and a logical error rate per logical qubit that is up to three orders of magnitude better. Moreover, some C2 codes achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a smaller qubit overhead than state-of-the-art LDPC codes such as the bivariate bicycle codes, at the price of a larger block length. Finally, leveraging the cyclic symmetry imposed on the codes, we design an efficient planar layout for the QCCD architecture, allowing for a trapped ion implementation of the syndrome extraction circuit in constant depth.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high-fidelity state transfer in spin chains, exploring the trade-off between expressivity and stability in quantum control.

Method: Discretized system dynamics compiled into a parameterized circuit with deterministic two-qubit blocks and trainable on-site RZ rotations, optimized using SLSQP for infidelity minimization.

Result: Both global and local parameterizations achieve near-unit fidelities in noiseless regimes, with the global scheme showing improved robustness under depolarizing noise.

Conclusion: The hybrid variational framework provides a scalable route to NISQ-compatible control synthesis, demonstrating an expressivity-stability trade-off.

Abstract: We present a hybrid variational framework for quantum optimal control aimed at high-fidelity state transfer in spin chains. The system dynamics are discretized and compiled into a parameterized circuit, where deterministic two-qubit blocks implement the drift interactions, while trainable on-site RZ rotations encode the control inputs. We study two parameterizations: a compact global scheme with a small number of shared parameters per slice, and a local scheme with site-wise angles. Using a Sequential Least Squares Quadratic Programming (SLSQP) optimization to minimize infidelity, simulations on XXZ spin chains show that both parameterizations can achieve near-unit fidelities in the noiseless regime. Under depolarizing noise, the global scheme provides improved robustness for comparable circuit depth and iteration budgets. The results make explicit an expressivity-stability trade-off and suggest a scalable route to Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) compatible control synthesis.

*Alan Sherry,Saptarshi Mandal,Sthitadhi Roy*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces partial projected ensembles as a tool to study quantum information distribution, revealing new phases of information structure via the Holevo information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure in quantum states beyond conventional entanglement measures, particularly in the context of partial projected ensembles.

Method: The study uses exact analytical results and numerical simulations to analyze the scaling of the Holevo information in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states.

Result: The Holevo information shows distinct phases (exponential decay and linear growth) with system size, defining new information phases and revealing non-analyticities at transitions.

Conclusion: The paper rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase and highlights the ability of the Holevo information to reveal fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures.

Abstract: The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore how time flow can vary locally within quantum many-body systems, particularly focusing on the relationship between local subsystem dynamics and global Hamiltonian evolution.

Method: The method involves defining local arrows of time in quantum many-body systems, analyzing their relation to spacetime quantum entropies, and providing numerical and analytical examples to illustrate their manifestations.

Result: The results demonstrate the existence of diverse local arrows of time, including those arising from quantum thermalization and quantum error correction, showing their distinct behaviors compared to global time.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that local arrows of time in quantum many-body systems can exhibit behaviors distinct from the global time, highlighting the relativity of time flow within subsystems and its connection to spacetime quantum entropies.

Abstract: We demonstrate that in quantum many-body systems, local arrows of time can differ from the global time $t$ induced by Hamiltonian evolution. That is, within a quantum many-body system, the flow of time can be relative to each observer or by proxy each local subsystem. We provide a definition of local arrows of time in quantum many-body systems, and explain their relation to spacetime quantum entropies. Then we give a variety of numerical and analytical examples which explore different ways in which local arrows of time can manifest in quantum many-body dynamics, including exotic arrows of time arising from quantum thermalization and quantum error correction.

Abstract: Superconducting circuits are a promising platform for implementing fault-tolerant quantum computers, quantum limited amplifiers, ultra-low power superconducting electronics, and sensors with ultimate sensitivity. Typically, circuit fabrication is realized by standard nanolithography, generally associated with a high level of control over defects and contaminants. Additive approaches have not been used so far since they are expected to be inferior in terms of superconducting properties or quantum coherence. This work shows that liquid-metal based micro-pipette printing is suited for fabricating superconducting lumped-element resonators with high internal quality factors. The applicability of our technique for low-loss superconducting device fabrication and the possibility to locally add metal structures, without affecting any preexisting circuit elements, is a further advantage. Our results open up new avenues in the hardware implementation of scaled-up superconducting quantum computers.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a fundamental task in quantum information science, enabling detailed characterization of correlations, entanglement, and electronic structure in quantum systems. However, its exponential measurement and computational demands limit scalability, motivating efficient alternatives such as classical shadows, which enable accurate prediction of many observables from randomized measurements. In this work, we introduce a bi-objective semidefinite programming approach for constrained shadow tomography, designed to reconstruct the two-particle reduced density matrix (2-RDM) from noisy or incomplete shadow data. By integrating $N$-representability constraints and nuclear-norm regularization into the optimization, the method builds an $N$-representable 2-RDM that balances fidelity to the shadow measurements with energy minimization. This unified framework mitigates noise and sampling errors while enforcing physical consistency in the reconstructed states. Numerical and hardware results demonstrate that the approach significantly improves accuracy, noise resilience, and scalability, providing a robust foundation for physically consistent fermionic state reconstruction in realistic quantum simulations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve classical shadow methods by leveraging bootstrap resampling for better estimation of variability and accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes the use of nonparametric bootstrapping to assess the variability and accuracy of estimators by resampling from classical shadow measurements.

Result: Bootstrap distributions are shown to differ from Gaussian approximations, and theoretical error bounds are not as tight as bootstrap percentiles.

Conclusion: The study suggests that resampling tools can enhance classical shadow methods by providing more accurate risk assessments, as bootstrap distributions differ significantly from Gaussian approximations and theoretical error bounds.

Abstract: Classical shadows are an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements. In the paper we propose to enhance classical shadow methods using bootstrap resampling methods. We apply nonparametric bootstrapping to assess the variability and accuracy of estimators by repeatedly sampling with replacement from the observed data, i.e.\ in our case the classical shadow measurements. We show that the bootstrap distributions are very different from the Gaussian approximations. Likewise, the theoretical error bounds are not tight compared to the bootstrap percentiles. Finally, we suggest using resampling tools to make risk assessments.

Motivation: To address the challenge of noise in fault-tolerant quantum computers by exploiting metastability in quantum hardware noise.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework and noise resilience metric, applied to variational quantum algorithms and analog adiabatic state preparation, with experimental validation on gate-model quantum processors and quantum annealing devices.

Result: Experimental evidence supports the presence of metastable noise, enabling noise-aware algorithm design for improved resilience.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that leveraging metastable noise in quantum hardware can improve the resilience of quantum algorithms, bringing noisy states closer to ideal ones.

Abstract: The presence of noise is the primary challenge in realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we introduce and experimentally validate a novel strategy to circumvent noise by exploiting the phenomenon of metastability, where a dynamical system exhibits long-lived intermediate states. We demonstrate that if quantum hardware noise exhibits metastability, both digital and analog algorithms can be designed in a noise-aware fashion to achieve intrinsic resilience. We develop a general theoretical framework and introduce an efficiently computable noise resilience metric that avoids the need for full classical simulation of the quantum algorithm. We illustrate the use of our framework with applications to variational quantum algorithms and analog adiabatic state preparation. Crucially, we provide experimental evidence supporting the presence of metastable noise in gate-model quantum processors as well as quantum annealing devices. Thus, we establish that the intrinsic nature of noise in near-term quantum hardware can be leveraged to inform practical implementation strategies, enabling the preparation of final noisy states that more closely approximate the ideal ones.

Abstract: Nash equilibria are crucial for understanding game behavior and systems in economics, physics, biology, and computer science. A significant application arises from the connection between Nash equilibria and optimization problems . However, finding Nash equilibria is challenging due to its NP-Hard complexity, specifically within the PPAD class. By exploiting the correspondence between Maximum Independent Sets (MIS) and Nash equilibria on unit-disk graphs, we map these problems onto the ground state configurations of Rydberg atom arrays. Simulations show the effectiveness of this quantum method, highlighting its potential for solving complex problems in game theory.

Abstract: Many-body quantum systems, under suitable conditions, exhibit time-translation symmetry breaking and settle in a discrete time crystalline (DTC) phase -- an out-of-equilibrium quantum phase of matter. The defining feature of DTC is a robust subharmonic response. However, the DTC phase is fragile in the presence of environmental dissipation. Here, we propose and exemplify a DTC phase in a noninteracting system that owes its stability to environmental dissipation. The lifetime of this DTC is independent of initial conditions and the size of the system, though it depends on the frequency of the external driver. We experimentally demonstrate this realization of DTC using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy.

*Marco Bernardi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Researchers propose a novel quantum period-finding method using single-qubit density matrices (1-RDMs) instead of traditional bit-string sampling, showing it retains enough information to determine the period efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore an alternative approach to quantum period-finding that avoids the computational overhead of sampling exponentially many bit strings, leveraging the simpler structure of 1-RDMs instead.

Method: The authors analyze the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit through state-vector simulations for a generic periodic function, identifying distinctive patterns that allow the period to be determined using a numerical root-finding approach.

Result: The 1-RDMs contain sufficient information to reconstruct the period, effectively compressing the required data from O(2^n) bit strings to O(n) one-qubit marginals.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that single-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) can effectively replace the traditional approach of measuring output bit strings in the quantum period-finding algorithm, providing a more efficient method for determining the period of a function.

Abstract: The quantum period-finding (QPF) algorithm can compute the period of a function exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithm. In standard QPF, the output state has a primary contribution from $r$ high-probability bit strings, where $r$ is the period. Measurement of this state, combined with continued fraction analysis, reveals the unknown period. Here, we explore a different approach to QPF, where the period is obtained from single-qubit quantities $-$ specifically, the set of one-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) $-$ rather than the output bit strings of the entire quantum circuit. Using state-vector simulations, we compute the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit for a generic periodic function. Analysis of these 1-RDMs as a function of period reveals distinctive patterns, which allows us to obtain the unknown period from the 1-RDMs using a numerical root-finding approach. Our results show that the 1-RDMs $-$ a set of $O(n)$ one-qubit marginals $-$ contain enough information to reconstruct the period, which is typically obtained by sampling the space of $O(2^n)$ bit strings. Conceptually, this can be viewed as a "compression" of the information in the QPF algorithm, which enables period-finding from $n$ one-qubit marginals. Our results motivate the development of approximate simulations of reduced density matrices to design novel period-finding algorithms.

TL;DR: A quantum analog algorithm avoids digitization, efficiently simulating nonlinear PDEs with provable speedup and noise resilience, demonstrated on Burgers' and Fisher-KPP equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of implementing digital, fault-tolerant quantum linearization approaches on current hardware by proposing an analog method that avoids Hilbert-space digitization and provides provable efficiency.

Method: An analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements, encoding classical fields as coherent states and mapping nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann formalism.

Result: The algorithm is provably efficient for simulating high-dimensional, nonlinear PDEs, demonstrated by successful simulations of the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation, with resilience to photon loss under strong-dissipation conditions.

Conclusion: The paper presents a continuous-variable framework for simulating nonlinear systems using quantum analog hardware, demonstrating its efficiency and resilience to noise, and identifies a pathway for practical quantum speedup on near-term devices.

Abstract: Quantum computers have long been expected to efficiently solve complex classical differential equations. Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers. However, provable speedups typically require digital truncation and full fault tolerance, rendering such linearization approaches challenging to implement on current hardware. Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\mathcal{O}\left(T(\log L + d r \log K)\right)$. The capability of the scheme is demonstrated by using it to simulate the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation. The resilience of the method to photon loss is shown under strong-dissipation conditions and an analytic counterterm is derived that systematically cancels the dominant, experimentally calibrated noise. This work establishes a continuous-variable framework for simulating nonlinear systems and identifies a viable pathway toward practical quantum speedup on near-term analog hardware.

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers, with possible applications in areas such as drug discovery and high-energy physics. However, the practical implementation of quantum computation is hindered by the complexity of executing quantum circuits on hardware. In particular, minimizing the number of T-gates is crucial for implementing efficient quantum algorithms. AlphaTensor-Quantum is a reinforcement learning-based method designed to optimize the T-count of quantum circuits by formulating the problem as a tensor decomposition task. While it has demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on benchmark quantum arithmetic circuits, its applicability has so far been restricted to specific circuit families, requiring separate, time-intensive training for each new application. This report reproduces some of the key results of the original work and extends AlphaTensor-Quantum's capabilities to simplify random quantum circuits with varying qubit counts, eliminating the need for retraining on new circuits. Our experiments show that a general agent trained on 5- to 8-qubit circuits achieves greater T-count reduction than previous methods for a large fraction of quantum circuits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a general agent trained on circuits with varying qubit numbers outperforms agents trained on fixed qubit numbers, highlighting the method's generalizability and its potential for broader quantum circuit optimization tasks.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，非厄米$PT$对称系统在量子比特的相干时间上显著优于传统的厄米系统，为量子信息处理中的退相干问题提供了新的解决策略。

Abstract: Quantum computing's potential for exponential speedup is fundamentally limited by decoherence, a phenomenon arising from environmental interactions. Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics, particularly $PT$-symmetric systems, offers a novel framework for extending coherence times. This study examines a qubit's coherence under non-Hermitian $PT$-symmetric dynamics, highlighting significantly enhanced coherence times compared to Hermitian setups. The effect is especially pronounced when both the system and environment exhibit $PT$-symmetry. Interestingly, greater environmental non-Hermiticity correlates with extended coherence, contrary to traditional expectations. These findings point to promising strategies for managing decoherence, which could significantly advance approaches to quantum information processing.

TL;DR: Study on isolated laser pulse Fourier transforms shows their asymptotic behavior links to probability distributions of large fluctuations in quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by recent findings on the probability distributions of quadratic operators in second quantized systems, particularly the slow decrease of these distributions leading to high probabilities for large fluctuations.

Method: Numerical calculation of the Fourier transform of isolated laser pulses and analysis of their asymptotic behavior at high frequencies.

Result: A model demonstrates that the Fourier transform of isolated pulses decreases as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency, with specific examples in the range of 0.1 to 0.2.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the probability distribution for large fluctuations mirrors the Fourier transform behavior of isolated laser pulses, indicating significant probabilities for fluctuations much larger than the variance.

Abstract: This paper will deal with isolated laser pulses, those which last for a finite time interval and whose envelope function is strictly zero outside of this interval. We numerically calculate the Fourier transform of this function and study its asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. This work is motivated by recent results on the probability distributions of quadratic operators in second quantized systems. An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform. We describe a model for the creation of isolated pulses in which this Fourier transform falls as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency and find examples where this fraction is in the range 0.1 to 0.2. The probability distribution for large fluctuation has the same functional form and implies a significant probability for fluctuations very large compared to the variance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a reliable and efficient method for detecting enantiomeric excess in chiral molecules, avoiding the limitations of traditional approaches.

Method: A cavity-QED platform is used to monitor steady-state intracavity photon number, leveraging the intrinsic phase difference between enantiomers and employing a generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation for analysis.

Result: The scheme achieves an enantiomeric excess readout with an error below 5%, demonstrating its effectiveness for both single molecules and finite ensembles.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a viable method for enantiomer detection in quantum-optical settings, achieving high accuracy with potential for practical applications.

Abstract: We investigate enantiodetection for both a single cyclic three-level chiral molecule and finite ensembles of such molecules by monitoring the steady-state intracavity photon number in a cavity-QED platform. Our scheme exploits the intrinsic global $π$-phase difference between opposite enantiomers to engineer destructive and/or constructive interference pathways, enabling a direct readout of enantiomeric excess with an error below $5\%$. To capture mesoscopic many-molecule effects beyond mean field while avoiding brute-force master-equation simulations, we employ a generalized discrete truncated Wigner approximation, which is well suited for systems with many yet finite molecules. These results pave the way for implementing enantiodetection in realistic quantum-optical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the most efficient mapping (first or second quantized) for bosonic systems, balancing qubit efficiency and gate efficiency.

Method: Comparison of first and second quantized bosonic mappings, focusing on resource requirements such as qubits and gates, with detailed numeric analysis.

Result: The first quantized mappings are more efficient for off-diagonal terms in k-RDM by a factor of ~N^k. The binary first quantized mapping is gate-efficient for realistic N and M and requires fewer qubits than unary mappings.

Conclusion: The binary first quantized mapping can be both qubit- and gate-efficient for practical problems, especially for realistic combinations of N and M, while requiring exponentially fewer qubits than unary mappings.

Abstract: We compare the basic resource requirements for first and second quantized bosonic mappings in a system consisting of $N$ particles in $M$ modes. In addition to the standard binary first quantized mapping, we investigate the unary first quantized mapping, which we show to be the most gate-efficient mapping for bosons in the general case, although less qubit-efficient than binary mappings. Our comparison focuses on the $k$-body reduced density matrix ($k$-RDM) as well as two standard bosonic Hamiltonians. The first quantized mappings use less resources for off-diagonal terms of the $k$-RDM by a factor of $ \sim N^k$, compared to the second quantized mappings. The number of gates for the first quantized binary mapping increases faster with $M$ compared to the other mappings. Nevertheless, a detailed numeric analysis reveals that the binary first quantized mapping still requires fewer gates than the binary and unary second quantized ones for realistic combinations of $N$ and $M$, while requiring exponentially fewer qubits than the unary mappings. Additionally, the number of CNOT and $R_z(φ)$ gates necessary to express the exponential of the Hamiltonian in the binary first quantized mapping is comparable to the (overall most efficient) unary first quantized one when $M = 2^n$ for both the Bose-Hubbard model and the harmonic trap with short-range interactions. This suggests that this mapping can be both qubit- and gate-efficient for practical problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Experimental observation of quantum backflow has been challenging due to its small effect size (less than 4% backward flow) and the difficulty in preparing and verifying wave packets with well-defined momentum direction under noisy conditions.

Method: Introduction of a general formulation for quantum backflow applicable to arbitrary momentum distributions, recovering standard limits and identifying excess probability flow. Extension to quantum reentry with explicit examples.

Result: The framework demonstrates an excess probability flow of nearly 13%, exceeding the standard backflow limit by more than a factor of three, and extends to quantum reentry with examples of states exhibiting large general backflow.

Conclusion: The study overcomes experimental challenges related to quantum backflow by introducing a general formulation applicable to arbitrary momentum distributions, showing an excess probability flow of nearly 13%, surpassing the standard backflow limit. It also extends the framework to quantum reentry, providing explicit examples and foundational implications.

Abstract: Quantum backflow is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which the probability density of a quantum particle propagates opposite to its momentum. Experimental observation of backflow has remained elusive due to two main challenges: (i) the effect is intrinsically small, with less than 4% of the probability able to flow backward, and (ii) it requires wave packets with a well-defined momentum direction, which are difficult both to prepare and to verify under realistic, noisy conditions. Here, we overcome these challenges by introducing a general formulation of quantum backflow applicable to arbitrary momentum distributions. The framework recovers the standard backflow limit for unidirectional states and identifies general backflow as probability flow exceeding that predicted by the particle's momentum distribution alone. We show that this excess can reach nearly 13%, surpassing the standard backflow bound by more than a factor of three. Furthermore, we extend the framework to the closely related phenomenon of quantum reentry, provide explicit examples of quantum states exhibiting large general backflow and reentry, and discuss the foundational implications of these nonclassical effects. Our results open a pathway toward the experimental observation of quantum backflow in realistic settings.

Motivation: To address the challenge of implementing quantum operations on qLDPC codes, which are hard to compute with but offer high encoding rates and large distance relative to block size.

Method: A construction to implement Clifford quantum gates on LCS codes, including deterministic fault-tolerant circuits and FT magic state preparation.

Result: Numerical simulations show pseudothresholds in the range 4.8·10⁻³-1.2·10⁻² for circuit-level noise, using a moderate number of qubits.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the feasibility of implementing fault-tolerant universal gate sets on LCS codes, with promising pseudothresholds and moderate qubit requirements, making them suitable for near-term quantum experiments.

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes are among the leading candidates to realize error-corrected quantum memories with low qubit overhead. Potentially high encoding rates and large distance relative to their block size make them appealing for practical suppression of noise in near-term quantum computers. In addition to increased qubit-connectivity requirements compared to more conventional topological quantum error correcting codes, qLDPC codes remain notoriously hard to compute with. In this work, we introduce a construction to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations on the recently introduced lift-connected surface (LCS) codes (Old et al. 2024). These codes can be implemented in a 3D-local architecture and achieve asymptotic scaling $[[n, \mathcal{O}(n^{1/3}), \mathcal{O}(n^{1/3})]]$. In particular, LCS codes realize favorable instances with small numbers of qubits: For the $[[15,3,3]]$ LCS code, we provide deterministic fault-tolerant (FT) circuits of the logical gate set $\{\overline{H}_i, \overline{H}_i, \overline{C_i X_j}\}_{i,j \in (0,1,2)}$ based on flag qubits. By adding a procedure for FT magic state preparation, we show quantitatively how to realize an FT universal gate set in $d=3$ LCS codes. Numerical simulations indicate that our gate constructions can attain pseudothresholds in the range $p_{\mathrm{th}} \approx 4.8\cdot 10^{-3}-1.2\cdot 10^{-2}$ for circuit-level noise. The schemes use a moderate number of qubits and are therefore feasible for near-term experiments, facilitating progress for fault-tolerant error corrected logic in high-rate qLPDC codes.

Conclusion: 量子自干涉效应和相位差调节了频率上下转换的概率，增强非互易性可以显著提高转换效率。

Abstract: We study the single-photon scattering in a one-dimensional (1D) waveguide coupled to one transition of a $V$-type giant atom (GA), whose other transition is coherently driven by an classical field. The inelastic scattering of single photons by the GA realizes the single-photon frequency conversion. By applying the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, the scattering coefficients for single photons incident from different directions are obtained, which present different scattering spectra in the Markovian and the non-Markovian regimes. The conversion contrast characterizing the nonreciprocity is also analyzed in both regimes. It is found that the probability of the frequency up- or down-conversion vanishes as long as the emission from either transition pathways for single photons is suppressed, but it is enhanced and even reach unity by introducing the nonreciprocity. It is the quantum self-interference induced by the scale of this two-legged GA and the phase difference between the GA-waveguide couplings that tune the probability of the frequency up- or down-conversion.

TL;DR: The paper revisits Hamiltonian twirling channels for simulating open quantum systems, proposing a fast-forwarding algorithm with improved efficiency and experimental feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the connection between Markovian open-system dynamics and Hamiltonian real-time evolutions to improve the efficiency and practicality of quantum algorithms for simulating open quantum systems.

Method: The method involves expressing the time-t evolution map as a Gaussian twirl over the unitary orbit of a Hamiltonian, enabling a fast-forwarding algorithm for Lindbladian simulation.

Result: The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves diamond-norm error with a time complexity matching prior work but without requiring auxiliary registers or controlled operations. Additionally, a continuous-variable quantum phase estimation algorithm is derived.

Conclusion: The study introduces Hamiltonian twirling channels as a powerful tool for simulating open quantum systems, providing a more efficient and experimentally friendly approach compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Simulation of open quantum systems is an area of active research in quantum algorithms. In this work, we revisit the connection between Markovian open-system dynamics and averages of Hamiltonian real-time evolutions, which we refer to as Hamiltonian twirling channels. Focusing on the class of Lindbladians with a single Hermitian jump operator $H$ recently studied in Shang et al. (arXiv:2510.06759), we show that the time-$t$ evolution map can be expressed exactly a Gaussian twirl over the unitary orbit ${\{\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{i} Hs}\}}_{s\in\mathbb{R}}$. This structural insight allows us to design a fast-forwarding algorithm for Lindbladian simulation that achieves diamond-norm error $\varepsilon$ with time complexity $O\big(\sqrt{t\log(1/\varepsilon)}\big)$ -- matching the performance of Shang et al. while requiring no auxiliary registers or controlled operations. The resulting ancilla-free and control-free algorithm is therefore more amenable to near-term experimental implementation. By purifying the Gaussian twirl procedure and performing a conjugate measurement, we derive a continuous-variable quantum phase estimation algorithm. In addition, by applying the Lévy-Khintchine representation theorem, we clarify when and how a dissipative dynamics can be realized using Hamiltonian twirling channels. Guided by the general theory, we explore Hamiltonian twirling with compound Poisson distributions and their potential algorithmic implications.

Abstract: We investigate photon transport and blockade based on the architecture where a waveguide is coupled to a microring resonator at two distinct points. This two-point coupling configuration between the waveguide and resonator gives rise to non-Markovian dynamics, which is induced by the photon transmission delay in the waveguide between the two coupled points. On one hand, by designing the non-Markovian coupling parameters between the waveguide and resonator, single or two-photon transport and the resulting photon blockade effect can be manipulated according to the output photonic states at the end of waveguide. This non-Markovian process can be evaluated by scattering matrices and second order correlation functions related to the distance between two coupled points. On the other hand, when classical driving fields are applied upon the resonator with interactions between its clockwise and counterclockwise modes, the blockade effect of the output field can be determined by the intracavtiy eigenstates. Then the correlations of the output field as well as the intracavity states can be modulated by the non-Markovian coupling between the microring resonator and waveguide.

Conclusion: CBMD 提供了一种高效且通用的方法，用于模拟非厄米特动态，通过矩阵分解和特征值位移技术，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce contour-based matrix decomposition (CBMD), a framework for scalable simulation of non-unitary dynamics. Unlike existing methods that follow the ``integrate-then-discretize" paradigm and rely heavily on numerical quadrature, CBMD generalizes Cauchy's residue theorem to matrix-valued functions and directly decomposes a non-Hermitian function into a linear combination of Hermitian ones, which can be implemented efficiently using techniques such as quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). For non-Hermitian dynamics, CBMD achieves optimal query complexity. With an additional eigenvalue-shifting technique, the improved complexity depends on the spectral range of the system instead of its spectral norm. For more general dynamics that can be approximated by non-Hermitian polynomials, where algorithms like QSVT face significant difficulties, CBMD remains applicable and avoids the assumptions of diagonalizability as well as the dependence on condition numbers that limit other approaches.

Motivation: To address the quantum backaction heating that limits resolved-sideband cooling in cavity optomechanics, aiming to achieve a lower phonon number and overcome the finite-temperature floor.

Method: The authors generalize the semi-classical model for optomechanical cooling to include universal cavity Hamiltonians with both passive and active nonlinearities, analyzing a circuit optomechanical system with a Josephson junction as a concrete example.

Result: The active nonlinear drive eliminates residual heating backaction, outperforming schemes based on passive nonlinearities.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that an active nonlinear drive can eliminate residual heating backaction, overcoming the finite-temperature floor in conventional optomechanical cooling schemes. This paves the way for unprecedented quantum control over mechanical systems.

Abstract: Resolved-sideband cooling is a standard technique in cavity optomechanics enabling quantum control of mechanical motion, but its performance is ultimately limited by quantum backaction heating. This fundamental effect imposes a limit on the minimum achievable mechanical phonon number, establishing a finite-temperature floor regardless of the applied cooling strength. We generalize the semi-classical model for optomechanical cooling to describe universal cavity Hamiltonians incorporating both passive and active nonlinearities. As a concrete demonstration, we analyze the simplest circuit optomechanical system that implements a nonlinear drive via a Josephson junction. Our analysis reveals that this active nonlinear drive can eliminate the residual heating backaction, thereby comparing favorably with alternative optomechanical cooling schemes based on passive nonlinearities arXiv:2202.13228. By successfully overcoming the finite-temperature floor that limits conventional schemes, our method paves the way for unprecedented quantum control over mechanical systems and establishes the experimental viability of zero-heating optomechanical cooling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how finite scalability impacts resource demands and runtime competitiveness in early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC), providing insights for next-generation hardware design.

Method: The study investigates resource requirements for simulating open-shell catalytic systems using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) under two scalability models. It compares hardware archetypes based on fidelity or operation speed and incorporates surface-code and LDPC-based fault tolerance.

Result: Finite scalability increases qubit and runtime demands but preserves scaling behavior. High-fidelity architectures require lower scalability to solve equally sized problems, and LDPC codes reduce space-time overhead.

Conclusion: The study highlights scalability as a key factor in quantum computing performance, with high-fidelity architectures requiring lower minimum scalability. LDPC codes further enhance competitiveness by reducing overhead. Continued progress in scalable architectures is essential for expanding quantum computing applications.

Abstract: As quantum hardware advances toward fault-tolerant operation, an intermediate stage known as early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC) is emerging, where partial error correction enables meaningful computation. In this regime, the ability of quantum processors to scale in size and depth has become a crucial factor shaping their achievable performance. This study investigates how finite scalability influences resource requirements for simulating open-shell catalytic systems using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The analysis compares hardware archetypes distinguished by fidelity or operation speed under two representative scalability models. Finite scalability increases qubit and runtime demands yet leaves overall scaling behavior intact, with high-fidelity architectures requiring lower minimum scalability to solve equally sized problems. These effects are largely independent of the chosen scalability model. Extending this framework, we examine runtime competitiveness across hardware and code configurations, incorporating surface-code and quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)-based fault tolerance under finite scalability. The results identify operating regimes where high-fidelity architectures remain competitive despite slower gate speeds and show that LDPC codes further expand this regime by reducing space-time overhead. Together, these findings highlight the central role of scalability in quantifying performance and guiding the design of next-generation quantum hardware. Continued progress in scalable architectures will be essential for extending quantum computing to increasingly complex scientific and industrial applications.

Abstract: Scaling superconducting quantum processors beyond single dilution refrigerators requires efficient optical interconnects, yet integrating microwave-to-optical (M2O) transducers poses challenges due to frequency mismatches and qubit decoherence. We propose a modular architecture using SNAIL-based parametric coupling to interface Brillouin M2O transducers with long-lived 3D cavities, while maintaining plug-and-play compatibility.

Implementing asymmetric entanglement pumping tailored to amplitude damping errors, we achieve purified fidelities F~0.94 at 0.2 kHz rates. Our cavity-based approach outperforms transmon schemes, providing a practical pathway for distributed superconducting quantum computing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore entanglement phase transitions in chaotic non-Hermitian spin chains, particularly focusing on the interplay between spin-spin coupling and non-Hermitian terms.

Method: Investigated two models: transverse field Ising model with a complex longitudinal field and non-Hermitian XX model with a transverse field, analyzing their complex spectra and simulating non-unitary evolution.

Result: A gapless-gapped phase transition occurs with dissipation rate variations, accompanied by oscillations in the complex gap. Entanglement entropy transitions from volume-law to area-law scaling, with unexpected results in the volume-law phase.

Conclusion: The study reveals a novel entanglement phase transition in chaotic non-Hermitian systems featuring unusual features in complex gaps and steady-state entanglement dynamics.

Abstract: We have studied entanglement phase transition in a class of chaotic non-Hermitian spin chain in which its spin-spin coupling term commutes with the non-Hermitian term. Two models are investigated: transverse field Ising model with a complex longitudinal field and non-Hermitian XX model with a transverse field. Through calculating their complex spectra, we find these models are subject to a gapless-gapped phase transition with dissipation rate if the transverse field is larger than a model-dependent value. Interestingly, the variation of the complex gap with the dissipation rate is not monotonous, instead it manifest oscillations before entering the gapped phase. By simulating their non-unitary evolution, we show that the entanglement entropy of the steady state would transition from a volume-law to an area-law scaling with the increase of the dissipation rate. Meanwhile, some unexpected results about the entanglement entropy appear in the volume-law phase. These unusual features of the complex gap and the steady-state entanglement can be attributed to level crossings between the maximal imagine level and other levels. Our work reveals a novel entanglement transition in chaotic non-Hermitian systems.

TL;DR: A dynamical law bounds the sum of local Wigner negativities by the initial state's negativity, with deviations diagnosing decoherence and control errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how entanglement grows and redistributes as a finite, budgeted resource in quantum systems, and to develop a practical metric for diagnosing decoherence and control errors.

Method: The result is proven analytically for two-body systems and corroborated numerically in engineered state-transfer chains, with specific focus on the XY model and its beam-splitter analogue.

Result: The sum of local Wigner negativities is bounded by the initial state's negativity, and intermediate times show this sum lying below the bound due to phase-space overlap. This reveals coherence-enabled dark transport, where the resource becomes locally invisible while stored in multi-body coherences.

Conclusion: The study establishes a dynamical law for excitation-preserving interactions, showing that the sum of local Wigner negativities is bounded by the initial excited state's negativity. This bound is saturated only when the excitation is fully localized, and deviations from the budgeted curve can diagnose decoherence and control errors.

Abstract: We prove a simple dynamical law for excitation-preserving interactions: the {sum of local Wigner negativities} is upper-bounded by a fixed budget set by the initially excited state. For the single-excitation sector of the XY model (and its beam-splitter analogue), this convexity bound equals the negativity of the seed state and is saturated only when the excitation is fully localized. At intermediate times the sum lies strictly below the bound due to phase-space overlap in local mixtures, quantitatively accounting for entanglement growth as a redistribution of a finite, budgeted resource into shared correlations. We establish the result analytically for two bodies and corroborate it numerically in engineered state-transfer chains, where it reveals a coherence-enabled dark transport: the resource becomes locally invisible while being stored in multi-body coherences. The predicted trajectory of the summed local negativity provides a practical hardware metric: deviations from the ideal, budgeted curve diagnose decoherence and control error.

Abstract: Motivated by the compelling need for coherent atom transport in a variety of emerging quantum technologies, we investigate such transport on the example of an adjustable family of two-dimensional optical lattices [L. Tarruell {\em et al.}, Nature (London) 483, 302 (2012)] that includes square, triangular, honeycomb, dimerized, and checkerboard lattices as its special cases; dynamical optical lattices of this type have already been utilized for the demonstration of topological pumping and the realiza- tion of two-qubit quantum gates with neutral atoms. At the outset, we propose the appropriate arrangements of acousto-optic modulators that give rise to a frequency imbalance between coun- terpropagating laser beams, thus leading to the dynamical-lattice effect in an arbitrary direction in the lattice plane. We subsequently obtain the dynamical-lattice trajectories that enable atom transport using shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) in the form of inverse engineering based on a dy- namical invariant of Lewis-Riesenfeld type. We then quantify the resulting atom dynamics using the transport fidelity computed from the numerical solutions of the relevant time-dependent Schroedinger equation. We do so for various choices of the system parameters and transport directions, finding favorable results for the achievable transport times and robustness of the resulting transport to various experimental imperfections.

Abstract: Quantum computing is transitioning from laboratory research to industrial deployment, yet significant challenges persist: system scalability and performance, fabrication yields, and the advancement of algorithms and applications. We emphasize that in building quantum computers -- spanning quantum chips, system integration, instruction sets, algorithms, and middleware such as quantum error correction schemes -- design is everywhere. In this paper, we advocate for a holistic design perspective in quantum computing, a perspective we argue is pivotal to unlocking innovative co-design opportunities and addressing the aforementioned key challenges. To equip readers with sufficient background for exploring co-optimization opportunities, we detail how interconnected computational methods and tools collaborate to enable end-to-end quantum computer design. This coverage encompasses critical stages -- such as chip layout design automation, high-fidelity system-level simulation, Hamiltonian derivation for quantum system modeling, control pulse simulation, decoherence analysis, and physical verification and testing -- followed by quantum instruction set design. We then proceed to quantum system and software development, including quantum circuit synthesis, quantum error correction and fault tolerance, and logic verification and testing. Through these discussions, we illustrate with concrete examples -- including co-optimizing quantum instruction sets with algorithmic considerations, customizing error correction circuits to hardware-specific constraints, and streamlining quantum chip design through tailored code design, among others. We hope that the detailed end-to-end design workflow as well as these examples will foster dialogue between the hardware and software communities, ultimately facilitating the translation of meaningful research findings into future quantum hardware implementations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how nonlocal interactions affect quantum correlations beyond entanglement entropy and to compare these effects with predictions from holographic duality.

Method: Numerical lattice simulations and analysis of correlation measures (mutual information and tripartite information) in a bosonic nonlocal field theory.

Result: Nonlocality exhibits long-range mutual information, unusual monogamy structures, and enhances multipartite entanglement with increasing separation. Holographic duality captures entropy scaling but conflicts with field theory predictions on correlation suppression.

Conclusion: Nonlocality in quantum field theory generates complex entanglement structures that challenge conventional geometric models of spacetime, necessitating a new framework to fully understand such correlations.

Abstract: Nonlocal interactions are known to generate volume-law entanglement entropy. However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \(A\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations.

Abstract: We study scattering of particles which obey an $SU(N)$ global symmetry through the lens of quantum computation and quantum algorithms. We show that for scattering between particles which transform in the fundamental or anti-fundamental representations, i.e. qudits, all 2-2 scattering amplitudes can be constructed from only three quantum gates. Further, for any $N$, all 2-2 scattering channels are shown to emerge from the span of a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ algebra, suggesting that scattering in this context is fundamentally governed by the action of ``bit flips'' on the internal quantum numbers. We frame these findings in terms of quantum algorithms constructed from Linear Combinations of Unitaries and block encoding.

Abstract: Finite-size general security proofs for quantum key distribution based on Rényi entropies have recently been introduced. These approaches are more flexible and provide tighter bounds on the secret key rate than traditional formulations based on the von Neumann entropy. However, deploying them requires minimizing the conditional Rényi entropy, a difficult optimization problem that has hitherto been tackled using ad-hoc techniques based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which are unstable and can only handle particular cases. In this work, we introduce a method based on non-symmetric conic optimization for solving this problem. Our technique is fast, reliable, and completely general. We illustrate its performance on several protocols, whose results represent an improvement over the state of the art.

Motivation: To address the computational intractability of the forward approach in solving the inverse problem in statistical field theories and to provide a practical solution for learning field theories in strongly coupled regimes.

Result: Accurate parameter recovery in benchmark systems and the ability to reconstruct full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows, including phase boundaries and fixed points.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides a robust framework for solving the inverse problem in statistical field theories, enabling accurate parameter recovery and access to non-perturbative renormalization-group flows, fixed points, and emergent interactions, with potential applications in strongly coupled regimes.

Abstract: Recovering microscopic couplings directly from data provides a route to solving the inverse problem in statistical field theories, one that complements the traditional-often computationally intractable-forward approach of predicting observables from an action or Hamiltonian. Here, we propose an approach for the inverse problem that uniformly accommodates systems with discrete, continuous, and hybrid variables. We demonstrate accurate parameter recovery in several benchmark systems-including Wegner's Ising gauge theory, $φ^4$ theory, Schwinger and Sine-Gordon models, and mixed spin-gauge systems, and show how iterating the procedure under coarse-graining reconstructs full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows. This gives direct access to phase boundaries, fixed points, and emergent interactions without relying on perturbation theory. We also address a realistic setting where full gauge configurations may be unavailable, and reformulate learning algorithms for multiple field theories so that they are recovered directly using observables such as correlations from scattering data or quantum simulators. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in practical learning of field theories in strongly coupled regimes where analytical tools might fail.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a general framework for computing free energy differences in open systems undergoing non-equilibrium processes, especially in cases where traditional methods (e.g., Jarzynski equality) are inapplicable due to complex dynamics or coupling.

Method: The paper employs trajectory-based analysis and an asymptotic equilibration postulate to derive exact fluctuation equalities. It focuses on the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between initial and final marginal probability distributions.

Result: The derived equalities accurately recover free energy differences for non-equilibrium processes, validated in scenarios where the Jarzynski equality assumptions break down.

Conclusion: The derived fluctuation equalities provide a robust framework for recovering free energy differences in open systems, even under non-equilibrium conditions. The approach is validated through a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive, demonstrating its applicability where traditional methods like the Jarzynski equality fail.

Abstract: We derive exact fluctuation equalities for open systems that recover free energy differences between two equilibrium endpoints connected by nonequilibrium processes with arbitrary dynamics and coupling. The exponential of the free energy difference is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final marginal probability distribution of the open system. A trajectory counterpart of this relation follows from an asymptotic equilibration postulate, which treats relaxation to the final stationary canonical state as a boundary condition rather than as a consequence of constraints on the driven dynamics. In the frozen-coupling regime, the HMF shift reduces to the bare-system Hamiltonian shift, yielding a clear heat-work decomposition. The Jarzynski equality (JE) is recovered under the assumption of Hamiltonian dynamics for the combined system. We validate the theory on a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive followed by an underdamped Langevin relaxation, where the assumptions underlying the JE break down, whereas our equality reproduces the exact free energy differences.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a fluctuation theorem for first-passage times in biomolecular machines, showing how entropy production conditions and hidden processes impact thermodynamic quantities in kinetic networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the connections between stochastic thermodynamic quantities and kinetic measurements in complex cooperative networks, specifically focusing on the first-passage time of observable processes coupled to hidden processes.

Method: A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of an observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions, using a generic kinetic model and an enzymatic model.

Result: The study demonstrates that entropy production remains constant when changes in stochastic entropy and free energy are balanced, revealing a first-passage time fluctuation theorem. Violations of this theorem indicate hidden detailed balance breaking, which can be experimentally detected.

Conclusion: The study provides a stochastic thermodynamics framework for analyzing a fluctuation theorem in biomolecular machines, highlighting the conditions under which entropy production remains constant and the implications for driven, coarse-grained systems.

Abstract: We examine a biomolecular machine involving a driven, observable process coupled to a hidden process in a kinetically cooperative manner. A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of the observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. Based on a generic kinetic model, we demonstrate that, along first-passage trajectories, entropy production remains constant when the changes in stochastic entropy and free energy of the machine are balanced, which corresponds to zero net hidden flux through the initial state manifold. Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize). In addition, using an enzymatic model, we show that the violation of our first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be thought of as a consequence of the breakdown of local detailed balance in the steps linking coarse-grained states that correspond to the initial and intermediate state manifolds. In the absence of hidden current, the fluctuation theorem is restored, and a mesoscopic local detailed balance condition can be established, which has implications for the thermodynamic analysis of driven, coarse-grained systems. This work sheds significant light on the unique connections between stochastic thermodynamic quantities and kinetic measurements in complex cooperative networks.

*Ming Li,Youjin Deng,Jesper Lykke Jacobsen,Jesús Salas*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: The study analyzed the three-point correlation function of the backbone in the 2D Q-state Potts model. Using Monte Carlo simulations, it found R_BB > R_FK in the critical regime, but R_BB = R_FK at tricriticality, suggesting shared geometric universality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To circumvent the severe critical slowing down in direct Potts simulations for large Q, the study aimed to understand the universal behavior of the backbone and FK clusters in the two-dimensional Q-state Potts model.

Method: Large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the O(n) loop model on the hexagonal lattice were employed, using a highly efficient cluster algorithm to compute the universal three-point amplitude ratios for the backbone (R_BB) and FK clusters (R_FK).

Result: The computed R_FK exhibited excellent agreement with exact conformal field theory predictions. In the critical regime, R_BB was found to be larger than R_FK, while at tricriticality, R_BB and R_FK coincided, indicating shared geometric universality.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that in the critical regime, the three-point amplitude ratio for the backbone (R_BB) is systematically larger than that for the FK clusters (R_FK). However, along the tricritical branch, R_BB and R_FK coincide within numerical accuracy, suggesting they share the same geometric universality at tricriticality.

Abstract: We study the three-point correlation function of the backbone in the two-dimensional $Q$-state Potts model using the Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) representation. The backbone is defined as the bi-connected skeleton of an FK cluster after removing all dangling ends and bridges. To circumvent the severe critical slowing down in direct Potts simulations for large $Q$, we employ large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the O$(n)$ loop model on the hexagonal lattice, which is regarded to correspond to the Potts model with $Q=n^2$. Using a highly efficient cluster algorithm, we compute the universal three-point amplitude ratios for the backbone ($R_\text{BB}$) and FK clusters ($R_\text{FK}$). Our computed $R_\text{FK}$ exhibits excellent agreement with exact conformal field theory predictions, validating the reliability of our numerical approach. In the critical regime, we find that $R_\text{BB}$ is systematically larger than $R_\text{FK}$. Conversely, along the tricritical branch, $R_\text{BB}$ and $R_\text{FK}$ coincide within numerical accuracy, strongly suggesting that $R_\text{BB}=R_\text{FK}$ holds throughout this regime. This finding mirrors the known equality of the backbone and FK cluster fractal dimensions at tricriticality, jointly indicating that both structures share the same geometric universality.

Motivation: 扩展之前对(p, l)=(2,2)情况的研究，探讨更高p和l值时色多项式零点的行为以及Potts反铁磁体的基态简并性。

Method: 利用q态Potts模型的配分函数与色多项式之间的关系，通过实空间重整化群变换（RG）和有理函数F_{(p,l),q}(v)的迭代，分析了图G^{(p,l)}_m在m趋近于无穷时的色多项式零点积累集B_q(p,l)。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过实空间重整化群变换计算出的色多项式的零积累集在复杂q平面上的行为具有多样性，并且在不同参数(p, l)下表现出有趣的特征。

Abstract: We calculate the continuous accumulation set ${\cal B}_q(p,\ell)$ of zeros of the chromatic polynomial $P(G^{(p,\ell)}_m,q)$ in the limit $m \to \infty$, on a family of graphs $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ defined such that $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ is obtained from $G^{(p,\ell)}_{m-1}$ by replacing each edge (i.e., bond) on $G^{(p,\ell)}_m$ by $p$ paths each of length $\ell$ edges, starting with the tree graph $T_2$. Our method uses the property that the chromatic polynomial $P(G,q)$ of a graph $G$ is equal to the $v=-1$ evaluation of the partition function of the $q$-state Potts model, together with (i) the property that $Z(G^{(p,\ell)}_m,q,v)$ can be expressed via an exact closed-form real-space renormalization (RG) group transformation in terms of $Z(G^{(p,\ell)}_{m-1},q,v')$, where $v'=F_{(p,\ell),q}(v)$ is a rational function of $v$ and $q$ and (ii) ${\cal B}_q(p,\ell)(v)$ is the locus in the complex $q$-plane that separates regions of different asymptotic behavior of the $m$-fold iterated RG transformation $F_{(p,\ell),q}(v)$ in the $m \to \infty$ limit. Thus, our results involve calculations of region diagrams in the complex $q$-plane showing the type of behavior that occurs in the $m \to \infty$ limit of the $m$-fold iterated RG transformation mapping $F_{(p,\ell),q}(v)$ starting with the initial value $v=v_0=-1$. Calculations are presented of the maximal point $q_c(G^{(p,\ell)}_\infty)$ at which the locus ${\cal B}_q$ crosses the real-$q$ axis, as well as several other points at which, depending on $p$ and $\ell$, the locus ${\cal B}_q$ crosses this axis. We give explicit results for a variety of $(p,\ell)$ cases and observe a number of interesting features. Calculations of the ground-state degeneracy of the Potts antiferromagnet at $q_c(G^{(p,\ell)}_\infty)$ are presented. This work extends a previous study with R. Roeder of the $(p,\ell)=(2,2)$ case to higher $p$ and $\ell$ values.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and expand the theoretical understanding of microwave-enhanced superconductivity, moving beyond existing non-equilibrium theories and examining the interplay between superconducting condensates and quantized electromagnetic fields.

Method: The research investigates the emergence of microwave dressed states within the superconducting condensate when coupled to a quantized electromagnetic field, analyzing the renormalized energy separation and the impact of photon-Cooper pair entanglement.

Result: Renormalized energy separation between microwave dressed states exceeds BCS theory predictions, with enhancement influenced by photon numbers and vacuum fluctuations. The superconducting condensate suppresses electric field fluctuations, including those from the vacuum state.

Conclusion: The study introduces an equilibrium quantum model of microwave-enhanced superconductivity, expanding beyond Eliashberg's non-equilibrium theory. It also shows that the superconducting condensate suppresses electric field fluctuations, aligning with Glauber and Lewenstein's field quantization in dielectric media.

Abstract: Microwave dressed states are found to emerge within the superconducting condensate when coupled to a quantized electromagnetic field due to photon-Cooper pair entanglement. The renormalized energy separation between these states exceeds the prediction of BCS theory, with the enhancement depending on the number of photons and also arising from electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. Our work introduces an equilibrium quantum model of microwave-enhanced superconductivity, expanding the theoretical description beyond Eliashberg's non-equilibrium theory. We further demonstrate that the superconducting condensate exerts a back-action on the electromagnetic field, suppressing electric field fluctuations, including those from the vacuum state. This result is consistent with Glauber and Lewenstein's field quantization in dielectric media.

TL;DR: A novel stripe parent phase precedes superconductivity in A_xFe_{2-y}Se_2, with a two-step transition mechanism explaining the high Tc enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the ambiguity surrounding the superconducting parent phase in A_xFe_{2-y}Se_2 (>30 K) compared to FeSe (8 K) and understand the origin of Tc amplification.

Method: Identification of a novel 'stripe-type orthorhombic phase' as the true parent phase, followed by decisive experiments to demonstrate its role in the superconducting state.

Result: The d2 peaks signify the parent phase, while asymmetric broadening of the d1 peaks indicates the transition into the superconducting state, clarifying the two-step process.

Conclusion: The study reveals a two-step transition mechanism involving the formation of a stripe parent phase and a subsequent superconducting distortion, offering a novel approach to Tc amplification through controlled heterogeneity.

Abstract: The origin of the four-fold Tc amplification in A_xFe_{2-y}Se_2 (>30 K) compared to FeSe (8 K) remains a central puzzle, complicated by a debate over the true superconducting (SC) parent phase--the I4/m (245) insulating matrix or a supposed I4/mmm metallic phase. Here, we resolve this ambiguity by identifying a novel "stripe-type orthorhombic phase" as the true parent phase of the high-Tc state, whose diffraction signature is the d2 peaks. Through decisive experiments, we demonstrate that this d2 parent phase is not intrinsically superconducting. Instead, superconductivity emerges only after this stripe phase undergoes a subsequent structural distortion, the definitive signature of which is the asymmetric broadening of the d1 main peaks. Our findings establish that the d2 peaks signal the formation of the parent phase, while the broadening of d1 peaks signals the transition into the superconducting state. This discovery of a two-step transition--formation of a stripe parent phase, followed by a superconducting distortion--provides a new mechanism for Tc amplification via controlled heterogeneity.

TL;DR: The paper links quantum geometry to measurable responses in 1+1D gapless systems via conformal field theory, validated analytically and numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and quantify the quantum geometry of 1+1 dimensional gapless many-body quantum systems described by conformal field theories.

Method: The study uses perturbation theory for small deformations and adiabatic drives for large deformations, combined with analytical results and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models.

Result: For small deformations, absorption rates and linear responses relate to the quantum geometric tensor; for large adiabatic deformations, periodic drives yield nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric. Findings are universal and depend only on the central charge.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a universal relationship between measurable quantities and quantum geometry in gapless many-body quantum systems, supported by analytical and numerical evidence.

Abstract: Much of our understanding of gapless many-body quantum systems stems from their low-energy descriptions as conformal field theories. This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models.

Motivation: To explore quantum transport phenomena in 2DEGs at oxide interfaces for advancements in spintronic and quantum information technologies.

Method: Systematic investigation of quantum conductance corrections in spin-polarized 2DEGs formed at oxide interfaces, focusing on the anomalous Hall effect and magnetoresistance.

Result: Discovery of long-range ferromagnetic order in 2DEGs, competition between weak localization and weak antilocalization, and tunability via optical gating.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate a controllable platform based on spin-polarized oxide 2DEGs for quantum transport, with potential applications in spin-orbitronic and topological electronic devices.

Abstract: Quantum transport phenomena in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at oxide interfaces have garnered significant interest owing to their potential in spintronic and quantum information technologies. Here, we systematically investigate the quantum conductance corrections of spin-polarized 2DEGs formed at the interfaces between two insulating oxides, ferromagnetic EuTiO3 (ETO) films and (111)-oriented KTaO3 (KTO) substrates. The anomalous Hall effect and hysteretic magnetoresistance provide clear evidence for long-range ferromagnetic order in the 2DEGs, which could be attributed to interfacial Eu doping in combination with the magnetic proximity effect of the ETO layer. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry by ferromagnetism in the 2DEGs, and with the assistance of spin-orbit coupling effect, gives rise to a nontrivial Berry phase. This results in a competition between weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) in the quantum transport of Dirac-like fermions at the KTO (111) interfaces. Notably, this competitive behavior can be effectively tuned by optical gating via a photoexcitation-induced shift of the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate a controllable platform based on spin-polarized oxide 2DEGs for quantum transport, opening new avenues for spin-orbitronic and topological electronic applications.

TL;DR: A unified protocol using disorder parameters is proposed to detect correlated topological insulators, demonstrated via simulations and analysis, facilitating experimental confirmation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of probing correlated topological insulators in experimental quantum simulators, where conventional methods like transport measurements are impractical.

Method: The research employs numerical simulations and analytical derivations to analyze disorder parameters for bosonic and fermionic correlated TIs, focusing on their non-analytical dependence on θ.

Result: The disorder parameter exhibits non-analytical dependence on θ for correlated TIs, providing a robust experimental signature.

Conclusion: The study successfully proposes and validates a unified protocol for detecting correlated topological insulators (TI) using disorder parameters, demonstrating its robustness against decoherence and applicability to near-term quantum simulation platforms.

Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators, characterized by symmetry-protected anomalous boundary modes, have been generalized to the strongly correlated regime for both bosonic and fermionic systems. As correlated topological insulators (TI) approach experimental realization in quantum simulators, conventional probes, such as transport measurements, are not easily applicable to these synthetic platforms. In this study, we focus on two examples of correlated TI: a bosonic TI protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2\times U(1)$ symmetry and the fermionic quantum spin Hall insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry. We propose a unified, readily implementable protocol based on measuring the disorder parameter $\langle\exp(\mathrm{i}θ\hat{Q}_A)\rangle$ for a large subregion $A$, with $\hat{Q}_A$ the total charge operator within $A$. Our key finding is that this quantity exhibits non-analytical dependence on $θ$ for correlated TI, a signature robust against decoherence. We establish this diagnostic through both numerical simulations and analytical derivations. This protocol is well-suited for implementation on near-term quantum simulation platforms, providing a direct route to experimentally confirm correlated TI.

Motivation: To investigate the dynamical properties of the tetratrillium lattice in langbeinite compounds, focusing on classical spin liquid behavior and quantum fluctuations.

Method: Classical Monte Carlo simulations, large-N theory calculations, and pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group calculations.

Result: The system exhibits a gapped spectrum with flat bottom bands, fragile spin liquid behavior, and no finite-temperature phase transition.

Conclusion: The study confirms the tetratrillium lattice's classical spin liquid properties in both large-N and more realistic Ising and Heisenberg cases, with no finite-temperature phase transition and insights into quantum S=1/2 limit.

Abstract: The tetratrillium lattice has recently been proposed as responsible for the dynamical properties observed in the $S=1$ langbeinite compound K$_2$Ni$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$. Here, we study in detail the classical spin liquid properties of this lattice of tri-coordinated tetrahedra using classical Monte Carlo and large-$N$ theory calculations. In the large-$N$ limit, we find that the system presents a gapped spectrum with flat bottom bands, giving rise to a fragile spin liquid with exponentially decaying correlations according to the classification of classical spin liquids. We confirm that this scenario also holds in the more realistic Ising and Heisenberg cases, for which the system does not exhibit any finite-temperature phase transition, and the low-temperature spin structure factors exhibit excellent quantitative agreement with the large-$N$ theory. We also provide insight into the quantum $S=1/2$ limit by performing pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group calculations at finite temperatures, and discuss the possible phases that can arise in the ground state due to quantum fluctuations.
