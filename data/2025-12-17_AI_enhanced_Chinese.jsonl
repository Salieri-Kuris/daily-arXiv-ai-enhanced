Our results yield distinctive critical behavior across all cumulants in the regime where the unmeasured parts of the system are maximally separated.

As case studies, we consider two models: the antiferromagnetic Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions. We calculate the ground state of these Hamiltonians with SSD using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm and evaluate the local transverse magnetization. For the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the quantum critical point can be accurately estimated by our procedure with systems of up to 84 sites, or even smaller, in good agreement with results from the literature. For the long-range model, we find that the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is slightly shifted relative to the nearest-neighbor case, leading to a reduced region of antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, we propose an experimental procedure to implement the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising couplings with SSD using Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers, which can be achieved within a very good approximation.

In this study, inspired by recent STM experiments on thin films, we investigate the quasiparticle interference (QPI) characteristics of bilayer nickelates in both normal and superconducting states to identify their Fermiology and pairing symmetry. We demonstrate that the mirror symmetry inherent in the bilayer structure induces mirror-selective quasiparticle scattering by establishing selection rules based on the mirror properties of impurities and the mirror eigenvalues of electronic wavefunctions. This mirror-selective scattering allows for the differentiation of distinct Fermiologies, as QPI patterns vary markedly between scenarios with and without the $d_{z^2}$-bonding Fermi surface (FS). Furthermore, it enables the separate detection of sign changes in superconducting gaps both within the same FS and between different FSs. Crucially, if the mirror-symmetry-enforced selection rules are ignored, the QPI response of an $s_\\pm$-wave state can masquerade as that of a conventional $s$-wave state, leading to a misidentification of the pairing symmetry. When combined with field-dependent and reference QPI measurements, this approach facilitates the precise determination of pairing symmetry, even in the presence of FS-dependent gaps and gap anisotropy. Additionally, we discuss practical considerations for STM measurements to effectively identify the pairing symmetry.

Here, we show how excitons trapped in a moir\u00e9 lattice can be used as an optical probe for spatially resolved electron spin density correlations in such materials. The electrons in the material of interest virtually tunnel to the moir\u00e9 lattice where they scatter on the excitons after which they tunnel back. This gives rise to an effective spin-dependent and spatially localised potential felt by the electrons, which in turn leads to energy shifts that can be measured spectroscopically in the exciton spectrum. Using second order perturbation theory combined with a solution to the exciton-electron scattering problem, we show that the electrons mediate an interaction between two excitons resulting in an energy shift proportional to their two-point spin density-density correlation function evaluated at the exciton positions. We then discuss two specific applications of our setup. First, we show that quantum phase transitions between different in-plane anti-ferromagnetic orders in a 2D lattice give rise to large and measurable shifts in the exciton spectrum in the critical regions.

Here, we present an all-optical scheme that mitigates both effects using a single digital micromirror device (DMD) operated in a double-pass configuration, in which light interacts with two separate regions of the same device. In the first pass, one region of the DMD is placed in a Fourier plane and implements a binary-amplitude hologram for individual addressing, while in the second pass a different region serves as a programmable intermediate image-plane aperture for spatial filtering. By multiplexing the Fourier-plane hologram to include secondary holograms, we generate weak auxiliary fields that interfere destructively with unwanted light at selected sites, while image-plane filtering suppresses the residual tail at larger distances. Together, these techniques maintain relative intensity crosstalk at or below $10^{-5}$ ($-50\\,\\mathrm{dB}$) across the full field of view relevant for qubit addressing, and further reduce the far-wing background to approximately $10^{-6}$ at large distances from the addressed qubit, approaching the detection limit.

Here, we present a framework for a generic, two-stroke quantum heat engine interacting with $N$ thermal baths and Maxwell's demon. The demon performs projective measurements on the engine working substance, the outcome of which is recorded in a classical memory, embedded in its own thermal bath. To perform feedback control, the demon enacts unitary operations on the working substance, conditioned on the recorded outcome. By considering the compound machine-memory as a hybrid (classical-quantum) standard thermal machine interacting with $N+1$ thermal baths, our framework puts the working substance and memory on equal footing, thereby enabling a comprehensible resolution to Maxwell's paradox.

Here, we study the information physics of quantum trajectories based on weak measurements in order to address the optimal achievable performance in qubit configuration readout for two realistic models of single qubit readout: (i) Model I is informationally complete, but without intrinsic dynamics; (ii) Model II is informationally incomplete weak measurements with intrinsic dynamics. We first use mutual information to characterize how much intrinsic information about the initial state is encoded in the measurement record. Using a fixed discrete time-step formulation, we compute the mutual information while varying the measurement strength, duration of measurement record, and the relative strength of intrinsic dynamics in our measurement schemes. We also exploit the emergence of continuum scaling and the Stochastic Master Equation in the weak measurement limit. We develop an asymptotic expansion in the measurement efficiency parameter to calculate mutual information, which captures qualitative and quantitative features of the numerical data.

Through a systematic analysis of level-spacing statistics, Krylov complexity, and entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that $H_{n}$ acts as a universal control parameter driving the transition from integrability to quantum chaos. Specifically, increasing the strength of $H_{n}$ induces a crossover from Poissonian to Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble statistics in the Hermitian limit, and similarly triggers chaotic dynamics in the non-Hermitian case. Most remarkably, despite the onset of global chaos, we identify a tower of exact nonthermal eigenstates that evade thermalization.

In this work, we develop an accurately controlled perturbative expansion of the time-evolution operator in the Heisenberg picture and derive beyond-semiclassical corrections to the emitter dynamics due to the coupling to the quantized electromagnetic field, capturing effects of the quantum fluctuations present in the latter. We focus on high-order harmonic generation (HHG), where the approach is accurate in parameter regimes of current interest and it gives closed-form expressions for key observables. This formulation not only simplifies numerical calculations compared to the Schr\u00f6dinger-picture approach but also provides a clear correspondence between nonclassical features of the emitted light and the underlying induced dynamics of the generating medium including quantum fluctuations. Moreover, the Heisenberg framework naturally yields scaling relations with the number of independent emitters, enabling us to assess whether nonclassical behavior should persist under typical experimental conditions involving large emitter ensembles. Interestingly, we find that the degree of squeezing increases with the number of emitters, whereas the photon statistics approaches a classical Poissonian distribution in the many-emitter limit. We also find that the beyond-semiclassical emitter dynamics significantly enhances the degree of squeezing of the emitted light.

We ran a state preparation and energy measurement protocol on an ion-trap quantum computer, without any non-scalable off-loading of computational tasks to classical computers, and show that leakage errors are the main obstacle to chemical accuracy.

VQE often struggles with convergence due to the energy landscape being highly non-convex and the existence of barren plateaux, and implementing AQC is beyond the capabilities of current quantum devices as it requires deep circuits. Adiabatically-inspired algorithms aim to fill this gap. In this paper, we first present a unifying framework for these algorithms and then benchmark the following methods: the Adiabatically Assisted VQE (AAVQE) (Garcia-Saez and Latorre (2018)), the Variational Adiabatic Quantum Computing (VAQC) (Harwood et al (2022)), and the Adiabatic Quantum Computing with Parametrized Quantum Circuits (AQC-PQC) (Kolotouros et al (2025)) algorithms.

This lack of transparency creates a security gap: users cannot verify whether their circuits were executed on the hardware for which they were charged. Forensic methods that infer backend behavior from user-visible artifacts are therefore becoming essential. In this work, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based forensic framework that predicts per-qubit and per-qubit link error rates of an unseen backend using only topology information and aggregated features extracted from transpiled circuits. We construct a dataset from several IBM 27-qubit devices, merge static calibration features with dynamic transpilation features and train separate GNN regressors for one- and two-qubit errors. At inference time, the model operates without access to calibration data from the target backend and reconstructs a complete error map from the features available to the user. Our results on the target backend show accurate recovery of backend error rate, with an average mismatch of approximately 22% for single-qubit errors and 18% for qubit-link errors. The model also exhibits strong ranking agreement, with the ordering induced by predicted error values closely matching that of the actual calibration errors, as reflected by high Spearman correlation.

This forms a new type of attack on the economics of cloud-based quantum computers. All major quantum computing companies today offer access to their hardware through some type of cloud-based service. Due to the noisy nature of quantum computers, a quantum circuit is run many times to collect the output statistics, and each run is called a shot. The fees users pay for access to the machines typically depend on the number of these shots of a quantum circuit that are executed. Per-shot pricing is a clean and straightforward approach as users are charged a small fee for each shot of their circuit. This work demonstrates that per-shot pricing can be exploited to get circuits to run for free when users abuse recently implemented mid-circuit qubit measurement and reset operations. Through evaluation on real, cloud-based quantum computers this work shows how multiple circuits can be executed together within a shot, by separating each user circuit by set of reset operations and submitting all the circuits, and reset operations, as one larger circuit. As a result, the user is charged per-shot pricing, even though inside each shot are multiple circuits. Total per-shot cost to run certain circuits could be reduced by up to $900$\\% using methods proposed in this work, leading to significant financial losses to quantum computing companies. To address this novel finding, this work proposes a clear approach for how users should be charged for their execution, while maintaining the flexibility and usability of the mid-circuit measurement and reset~operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This allows POVMs, quantum channels or more generally quantum instruments to be implemented sequentially, so that fewer qubits need to be used at each of the $N$ measurement steps. In this paper, we mathematically describe these problems via adaptive sequence of instruments (ASI) and show how any instrument can be decomposed into it. Number of steps $N$ and number of ancillary qubits $n_A$ needed for actual implementation are crucial parameters of any such ASI. We show an achievable lower bound on the product $N.n_A$ and we determine in which situations this tradeoff is likely to be optimal. Contrary to common intuition we show that for quantum instruments which transform $n$ to $m(>n)$ qubits, there exist $N$-step ASI implementing them just with $(m-n)$ ancillary qubits, which are remeasured $(N-1)$ times and finally used as output qubits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our proof techniques further suggest that, for inherently classical decision problems, constant-depth quantum circuits do not necessarily provide more power than their classical counterparts. Our third result shows that depth $2$ QAC$^0$ circuits, regardless of size, cannot exactly synthesize an $n$-target nekomata state (a state whose synthesis is directly related to the computation of PARITY).

A 109, 052823 (2024)] that captured electron-photon correlations via an exchange-correlation functional derived from the nonrelativistic Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian and tested on one-electron systems, we use a simple procedure to compute a renormalization factor describing electron-photon correlations and inhomogeneity in the weak-coupling regime by comparing it with quantum electrodynamics coupled-cluster, and previous QEDFT optimized effective potential methods. Across various atoms and molecules, pxcLDA reproduces cavity-modified densities in close agreement with these references. The renormalization factor approaches unity as the system size or collective coupling increases, reflecting an electron-photon exchange-dominated behavior and improved accuracy for larger systems.
