Abstract: We study the the large-$n$ dynamics of the long-range quantum $O(n)$ model, focusing on the strong long-range regime $α<d$. The dynamics of the model exhibits non-trivial features on mesoscopic timescales $t\sim\ln N$, due to the activation of parametric resonances of the nearly degenerate quantum modes. By using recent results establishing the integrability of the large-$n$ limit, we derive the resonance conditions, and construct the reduced multi-mode Hamiltonian that captures the finite-size dynamics. This framework yields the resonance phase diagram and clarifies when and how deviations from mean-field behavior arise. In particular, the presence of multiple resonant modes enhances the logarithmic growth of entanglement and leads to spatially modulated correlations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Kittel--Shore Hamiltonian characterizes $N$ spins with identical long-range interactions, and the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ coalgebra has been proven to be a symmetry of this model, which can be exactly solved. By using quantum groups and, in particular, $\mathfrak{su}_{q}(2)$, this Hamiltonian was deformed. In this work, we study the thermodynamic properties of this deformed model for spin-$1/2$ particles. In particular, we discuss how this deformation affects the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, magnetisation, and phase transitions as a function of the parameter $q$ of the deformation and compare them with those of the undeformed model. Deformation was found to shift the thermodynamic behaviours to higher temperatures and alter the phase transitions. The potential applications of this $q$-deformed model for describing few-spin quantum systems with non-identical couplings are discussed.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We have simulated an automaton version of the quenched Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (qKPZ) equation in one and two dimensions in order to study the scaling properties of the interface at the depinning transition. Specifically, the $α$, $β$, $θ$, and $δ$ critical exponents characterizing the surface kinetic roughening and depinning behaviors have been directly computed from the simulations. In addition, by studying the height-difference correlation function in real space, we have also been able to directly compute the dynamic correlation length and its associated dynamic critical exponent $z$. The full sets of scaling exponents are largely compatible with those of the Directed Percolation Depinning universality class for one and two dimensional interfaces. Furthermore, we have computed numerically the probability density function (PDF) of the front fluctuations in the growth regime, finding its asymptotic form in one and two dimensions. While the PDF features strongly non-Gaussian skewness and kurtosis values, it also differs from the PDF of the KPZ equation with time-dependent noise for physical substrate dimensions, both in the central part and at the tails of the distribution.

Abstract: Out-of-time ordered correlators are a probe of how the information of an initial perturbation is effectively scrambled under unitary time evolution, widely used to study quantum chaos. They have also been used to demonstrate that information is trapped in the zero dimensional edge modes of topological insulators and superconductors, and does not become scrambled. Here we study scrambling in two dimensional topological models. In the bulk the butterfly velocity, the speed at which the out-of-time ordered correlator spreads, gains a directional dependence from the underlying lattice. Furthermore when there are chiral or helical edge modes present these cause a form of dynamical scarring. The information about an initial perturbation on the boundary of the system travels around the edge, carried by the edge modes, but is not scrambled over very long time scales. The direction and speed of the scars are given by the velocities of the linearly dispersing edge modes. We further show that these scars do not interact, passing through each other. We back up these results with analytical and numerical calculations on exemplary models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Rare events refer to qualitatively unlikely events whose realization can nevertheless have important consequences. Typically, the prediction of the kinetics of these events relies on Arrhenius laws, with exponentially distributed waiting times, and no correlations between successive occurrences. However, this description breaks down in the presence of long-term memory, as has been observed in the contexts of geophysical time series or protein dynamics. So far, existing analytical approaches do not quantify the correlations between rare events due to long-term memory. Here, for non-Markovian Gaussian processes, we determine analytically the impact of long-term memory on the distribution of first and second passage times to a rarely reached threshold. This distribution is non-exponential, thus going beyond the Arrhenius paradigm. We obtain an explicit expression for the covariance between the first and second passage times, and we predict how the mean time to the next extreme event depends on the previous passage time, illustrating the phenomenon of clustering of extreme events. These analytical results, validated through extensive stochastic simulations, shed lights on the strong correlation between successive occurrences of extreme events due to long-term memory.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We apply the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) to study the large-scale dynamical properties of Brownian particles with arbitrary pairwise interaction. By combining it with standard results of equilibrium statistical mechanics for the collective diffusion coefficient, the MFT gives access to the exact large-scale dynamical properties of the system, both in- and out-of-equilibrium. In particular, we obtain exact results for dynamical correlations between the density and the current of particles. For one-dimensional systems, this allows us to obtain a precise description of these correlations for emblematic models, such as the Calogero and Riesz gases, and for systems with nearest-neighbor interactions such as the Rouse chain of hardcore particles or the recently introduced model of tethered particles. Tracer diffusion with the single-file constraint (but for arbitrary pairwise interaction) is also studied. For higher-dimensional systems, we quantitatively characterize these dynamical correlations by relying on standard methods such as the virial expansion.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the subsampling of the avalanches in the fiber bundle model of fracture. In cases where only a part of the system is observed for the micro-failure events, the recorded avalanche statistics gets distorted compared to the actual fracture events. We show that, particularly in the cases where the load redistribution is localized, this distortion is significant. Surprisingly, however, near an elastic failure regime, the distortion is minimized, suggesting a much reduced observational capacity could still represent the actual failure dynamics in the case of fracture of elastic solids.

Abstract: The Zitterbewegung phenomenon in multiband electronic systems is known to be subtly related to the charge conductivity, Berry curvature and the Chern number. Here we show that some spin-dependent properties as the optical spin conductivity, and intrinsic spin Hall conductivity are also entangled with the Zitterbewegung amplitudes. We also show that in multiband Dirac-type Hamiltonians, a direct link between the Zitterbewegung and the spin textures and spin transition amplitudes can be established. The later allow us to discern the presence or not of the Zitterbewegung oscillations by simply analyzing the spin or pseudo-spin textures. We provide examples of the applicability of our approach for Hamiltonian models that show the suppression of specific Zitterbewegung oscillations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, a lattice analogue of fractional quantum Hall effect, offers a unique pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation and deep insights into the interplay of topology and strong correlations. The exploration has been successfully guided by the paradigm of ideal flat Chern bands, which mimic Landau levels in both band topology and local quantum geometry. Yet, given the near-infinite possibilities for Bloch bands in lattices, it remains a major open question whether FQAH states can emerge in scenarios fundamentally different from this paradigm. Here we turn to a class of gapless flat bands, featuring divergent quantum geometry at singular band touching, non-integer Berry flux threading the Brillouin zone (BZ), and ill-defined band topology. Our exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations unambiguously demonstrate FQAH phase that is virtually independent of the interaction strength, persisting from the weak-interaction to the strong-interaction limit. We find the stability of the FQAH states does not uniquely correlate with the singularity strength or the BZ-averaged quantum geometric fluctuations. Instead, the many-body topological order can adapt to the singular and fluctuating quantum geometric landscape by spontaneously developing an inhomogeneous carrier distribution, while its quenching accompanies the drop in the occupation-weighted Berry flux. Our work reveals a profound interplay between quantum geometry and many-body correlation, and significantly expands the design space for exploring FQAH effect and flat-band correlation phenomena in general.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: All-optical switching in a ferromagnetic spin valve is studied here using atomistic spin drift-diffusion dynamics, which includes contributions from spin pumping and superdiffusive transport. The switching is governed by two main sources of current transients: i) spin currents pumped by the reference layer, and ii) spin-polarized currents due to non-equilibrium hot electrons excited by the laser pulse. In particular, an initial superdiffusive forward flow of electrons, polarized by the free layer, is generated. This drives parallel to antiparallel switching of the free layer through accumulation of minority spins at the reference layer. A diffusive backward flow of electrons, repolarized by the reference layer, follows the initial superdiffusive flow as the charge distribution re-equilibrates. Due to the pulse width-dependent asymmetric amplitudes of the forward and backward transients, the latter can drive antiparallel to parallel switching, and create multi-domain structures at higher laser fluences and longer pulses. The results obtained here are in agreement with experimental observations, providing a framework for self-consistent modelling of all-optical switching in metallic heterostructures.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We develop a quantum kinetic theory of two-dimensional electron gases in which exchange is treated self-consistently at the Hartree-Fock level and enters as a nonlocal, momentum-dependent field in phase space. By starting from the Coulomb Hamiltonian, we derive a Hartree-Fock-Wigner equation for the electronic Wigner function and obtain a closed fluid model with exchange-corrected pressure, force, and current. For a single layer, we show that exchange renormalizes the Fermi velocity and can drive a long-wavelength plasmonic instability at low densities. In coupled layers, the same framework predicts acoustic-optical mode coupling, and an instability forming long-lived charge-imbalance patterns that are not predicted by classical Vlasov and Boltzmann models. Finally, we apply the kinetic model to the Coulomb drag problem and show how exchange substantially enhances the drag resistivity in dilute GaAs double wells, quantitatively matching experimental observations.

Abstract: In superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), the superconducting diode effect may be generated by interference of multiple harmonic components in the current-phase relationships (CPRs) of different branches forming SQUID loops. Through the inclusion of two gate-tunable Josephson junctions in series in each interference branch of a double-loop SQUID, we demonstrate independent control over both the harmonic content and the amplitude of three interfering CPRs, facilitating significant improvement in the maximum diode efficiency. Through optimized gate-controlled tuning of individual Josephson energies, diode efficiency exceeding 50% is demonstrated. Flux-dependent oscillations show quantitative agreement with a simple model of SQUID operation.

Abstract: We study impacts of spin-orbit interactions on the spin susceptibility in quasicrystal superconductors, motivated by the anomolous superconducting properties in the van der Waals quasicrystal Ta$_{1.6}$Te under magnetic fields. We consider the Penrose tiling model with $s$-wave pairing as a representative system and include anisotropic spin-orbit interactions allowed for the quasicrystal structure. It is shown that the spin-momentum locking locally takes place in the quasicrystal, and electron motion and spin directions are tightly connected at each spatial position in the real space. As a result, the spin susceptibility is enhanced for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields in the presence of a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. For an Ising-type spin-orbit interaction, the spin susceptibility only for in-plane magnetic fields is increased, while the out-of-plane spin susceptibility is almost unchanged. When there are both kinds of the spin-orbit interactions, temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility for any field directions is suppressed.

Abstract: Superconductor LaRh$_2$As$_2$ has the same crystal structures as CeRh$_2$As$_2$, which exhibits superconducting (SC) multiphase in the $c$-axis magnetic field. Although the SC transition temperatures $T_c$ are similar, around 0.3 K, LaRh$_2$As$_2$ shows conventional type-II superconductivity with a small upper critical field $H_{c2}\sim$ 10 mT. At present, the SC properties of LaRh$_2$As$_2$ have not been clarified yet. We performed $^{75}$As-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on LaRh$_2$As$_2$ to investigate the SC properties and gap structure. $1/T_1$ shows a clear coherence peak just below $T_c$ and an exponential decrease at lower temperatures, suggesting full-gap $s$-wave superconductivity. The numerical calculations based on an $s$-wave SC model reveal an SC gap size of $Δ(0)/k_{B}T_{c} \sim 1.48$, consistent with the weak-coupling $s$-wave superconductivity. These results suggest that the 4$f$ electrons in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ not only enhance the orbital limiting field but also contribute to the formation of unconventional superconductivity with SC multiphase.

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is a key nonreciprocal phenomenon with broad relevance for superconducting electronics. Using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations, we predict and quantify a superconducting diode effect arising solely from geometric chirality imposed to a conventional superconductor. The helical geometry and magnetic-field-induced screening currents produce inequivalent critical currents for opposite polarities. The diode efficiency reaches a maximum when one current direction first nucleates vortices, revealing a chirality-controlled crossover between screening- and vortex-dominated nonreciprocity. These results establish mesoscopic geometric chirality as a robust mechanism for supercurrent rectification in an achiral superconductor. They suggest an experimentally accessible route towards 3D superconducting diodes for multi-level integrated quantum circuits.

Abstract: At low temperature, the concentration of quasiparticles observed in superconducting circuits far exceeds the predictions of microscopic BCS theory at equilibrium. As a source of dissipation, these excess quasiparticles degrade the performance of various devices. Therefore, understanding their dynamics, especially their recombination into Cooper pairs, is an active topic of current research. In disordered superconductors, spatial fluctuations in the superconducting gap can trap quasiparticles and modify their eigenspectrum. Since this spectrum plays a key role in quasiparticle dynamics, it must be carefully investigated. To this end, we introduce a toy model of a single trap. Specifically, we consider a shallow disk-shaped gap variation in a clean superconductor. Using a semiclassical approximation, we demonstrate the existence of multiple bound states and give the dependence of their number on the size and depth of the gap suppression. Extending our analysis beyond the semiclassical regime, in dimensions larger than one, we observe an infinite number of bound states very close to the gap edge, even for an arbitrarily small trap. These results deepen our understanding of trapped quasiparticles and may have important implications for their recombination in disordered superconductors.

Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of pressure-induced evolution of the magnetism and development of superconductivity (SC) in MnBi8Te13, a promising ambient pressure, ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulator candidate. By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n < 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are the leading candidates for near-term quantum advantage, yet their scalability is limited by the ``Barren Plateau'' phenomenon. While traditionally attributed to geometric vanishing gradients, we propose an information-theoretic perspective. Using ancilla-mediated coherent feedback, we demonstrate an empirical constitutive relation $ΔE \leq ηI(S:A)$ linking work extraction to mutual information, with quantum entanglement providing a factor-of-2 advantage over classical Landauer bounds. By scaling the system size, we identify a distinct efficiency transition governed by the dimension of the Dynamical Lie Algebra. Systems with polynomial algebraic complexity exhibit sustained positive efficiency, whereas systems with exponential complexity undergo an ``efficiency collapse'' ($η\to 0$) at $N \approx 6$ qubits. These results suggest that the trainability boundary in variational algorithms correlates with information-theoretic limits of quantum feedback control.

Abstract: This paper presents a hardware-conscious analysis of the quantum acceleration of the classical 3-round Keccak-256 preimage attack using Grover's Algorithm. While the theoretical quantum speed-up from T_cl=2^{57.8} (classical) to T_qu = 2^{28.9} (quantum) is mathematically sound, the practical implementation overhead is so extreme that attacks remain wholly infeasible in both resource and runtime dimensions. Using Qiskit-based circuit synthesis, we derive that a 3-round Keccak quantum oracle requires: 9,600 Toffoli gates (with uncomputation for reversibility); 3,200 logical qubits (1,600 state + 1,600 auxiliary); 7.47 * 10^{13} total 2-qubit gates (full Grover search); 3.2 million physical qubits (with quantum error correction)PROHIBITIVE; 0.12 years (43 days) to 2,365+ years execution time, depending on machine assumptions. These barriers -- particularly the physical qubit requirements, circuit depth, and error accumulation -- render the quantum attack infeasible for any foreseeable quantum computer. Consequently, SHA-3 security is not threatened by quantum computers for preimage attacks. We emphasize the critical importance of hardware-aware complexity analysis in quantum cryptanalysis: the elegant asymptotic theory of Grover's Algorithm hides an engineering overhead so prohibitive that the quantum approach becomes infeasible from both resource and implementation perspectives.

Abstract: Metastable decay exhibits a familiar exponential regime bracketed by early-time deviations and late-time power-law tails. We adopt the real-time, flux-based definition of the decay rate in the spirit of Andreassen et al.\ direct method and present a complete analysis of one-dimensional quantum-mechanical resonance models. We show that the kernel admits a universal pole--plus--branch decomposition and use it to define two computable time scales: a dawn time, when a single resonant contribution starts dominating and exponential decay sets in, and a twilight time, when the branch-cut tail overtakes exponential decay. The latter can be expressed in closed form via the Lambert $W$ function, making its parametric dependence manifest without fitting. For square, modified square, and Pöschl--Teller barriers we obtain simple thick-barrier formulas, clarify the relation $ΓT = T_{\text{trans}}$ between the decay rate $Γ$, oscillation period $T$, and transmission probability $T_{\text{trans}}$, and indicate how our spectral picture can be naturally extended to quantum field theoretic vacuum decay.

Abstract: The defining feature of ideal Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states is that they are unchanged by stabilizers, which allow them to detect and correct for common errors without destroying the quantum information encoded in the states. Given this property, can one use the amount to which a state is unchanged by the stabilizers as a proxy for the quality of a GKP state? This is shown to hold in the opposite manner to which it is routinely assumed, because in fact the fidelity a state has to an ideal GKP state is only upper bounded by the stabilizer expectation values. This means that, for qubits encoded in harmonic oscillators via the GKP code, a good stabilizer expectation value does not guarantee proximity to an ideal GKP state in terms of any distance based on fidelity.

Abstract: Quantum many-body dynamics generate nonclassical correlations naturally described by quantum resource theories. Quantum magic resources (or nonstabilizerness) capture deviation from classically simulable stabilizer states, while coherence and fermionic non-Gaussianity measure departure from the computational basis and from fermionic Gaussian states, respectively. We track these resources in a subsystem of a one-dimensional qubit chain evolved by random brickwall circuits. For resource-generating gates, evolution from low-resource states exhibits a universal rise-peak-fall behavior, with the peak time scaling logarithmically with subsystem size and the resource eventually decaying as the subsystem approaches a maximally mixed state. Circuits whose gates do not create the resource but entangle neighboring qubits, give rise to a ballistic spreading of quantum resource initially confined to a region of the initial state. Our results give a unified picture of spatiotemporal resource dynamics in local circuits and a baseline for more structured quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: The search for exactly solvable models is an evergreen topic in theoretical physics. In the context of multistate Landau-Zener models -- $N$-state quantum systems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians -- the theory of integrability provides a framework for identifying new solvable cases. In particular, it was proved that the integrability of a specific class known as the multitime Landau-Zener (MTLZ) models guarantees their exact solvability. A key finding was that an $N$-state MTLZ model can be represented by data defined on an $N$-vertex graph. While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \le 11$. Our results corroborate the aforementioned conjecture for graphs up to $11$ vertices. For even larger graphs, we propose a specific family, termed descendants of ``$(0,2)$-graphs'', as promising candidates that may violate the conjecture above. Our work can serve as a guideline to identify new exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models in the future.

Abstract: There are processes that cannot generate entanglement but may, nevertheless, amplify entanglement already present in a system. Here, we show that a non-entangling operation can increase the Schmidt number of a quantum state only if it can generate entanglement with some non-zero probability. This is in stark contrast to the case where the parties of a quantum network are only able to control their joint state by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). There, being able to apply operations probabilistically (stochastic LOCC) does not increase the Schmidt number. Our findings show that certain non-entangling operations become entangling when selecting on specific measurement outcomes. This naturally leads us to the class of stochastically non-entangling maps, being those that cannot generate entanglement even probabilistically. Intrigued by this finding, we devise a Schmidt number for quantum channels that quantifies whether a channel can generate entanglement probabilistically. Moreover, we show that a channel is non-entangling if and only if its dual map is witness-preserving -- it takes entanglement witnesses to witnesses. Based on this finding, we derive Bell-like inequalities whose violation signals that a process generates entanglement.

Abstract: We explore the information-theoretic phases of monitored quantum circuits subject to dynamics that conserves both charge and dipole moment, as well as measurements of the local charge density. Explicitly, both charge and dipole-moment conservation are strong symmetries, but under the dynamics they can be spontaneously broken to weak symmetries: this spontaneous symmetry breaking has an information-theoretic interpretation in terms of whether one can learn global charges from local measurements. We find a rich phase diagram: in one spatial dimension, charge is always easy to learn, while dipole moment can be either easy or hard. In two dimensions, we find three phases: for frequent measurements, both charge and dipole moment are easy to learn; as the measurement rate is decreased, first dipole moment and then charge become hard. In two dimensions, the low-measurement phase is an exotic critical phase with anisotropic spacetime scaling, analogous to a smectic liquid crystal.

Abstract: This paper investigates wave-packet dynamics in non-Hermitian lattice systems and reveals a surprising phenomenon: The simultaneous propagation of two distinct wavefronts, one traveling at the non-Hermitian velocity and the other at the Hermitian velocity. We show that this dual-front behavior arises naturally in systems governed by a pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Using the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model as our primary example, we demonstrate that this coexistence is essential for understanding a wide array of unconventional dynamical effects, including abrupt ``non-Hermitian reflections'', sudden shifts of Gaussian wave-packets, and disorder-induced emergent packets seeded by the small initial tails. We present analytic predictions that closely match numerical simulations. These results may offer new insight into the topology of non-Hermitian systems and point toward measurable experimental consequences.

Abstract: In the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era, noise is widely regarded as the primary obstacle to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, certain stages of the quantum computing pipeline can, in fact, benefit from this noise. In this work, we exploit the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis to show that noise generically accelerates a fundamental task in quantum computing -- the preparation of Gibbs states. We demonstrate this behavior using classical and quantum simulations with Haar-random and phase-flip noise, respectively, on a spin-1/2 chain with a local Hamiltonian. Our non-integrable model sees ~3.5x faster thermalization in the presence of noise, while our integrable model, which would not otherwise thermalize, reaches a thermal state due to noise. Since certifying a local Gibbs state is relatively easy on a quantum computer, our approach provides a new practical solution to a key problem in quantum computing. More broadly, these results establish a new paradigm in which noise can be harnessed on quantum computers, enabling practical advantages before the years of fault-tolerance.

Abstract: Transport and localization in isolated quantum systems are typically attributed to spatially-extended disorder, leaving the influence of a few controllable defects largely unexplored despite their relevance to engineered quantum platforms. We introduce an analytic framework showing how a single defect profoundly reshapes wave-function spreading on a finite isolated and periodic tight-binding lattice. Adapting the defect technique from classical random-walk studies, we obtain exact time-resolved site-occupation probabilities and several observables of interest. Even one defect induces striking nonlinear and nonlocal effects, including non-monotonic suppression of transport, enhanced localization at distant sites, and strong sensitivity to the initial particle position at long times. These results demonstrate that minimal perturbations can generate unexpected long-time transport signatures, establishing a microscopic defect-driven mechanism of quantum localization.

Abstract: Providing an operational characterization of the Wigner-positive states (WPS), i.e., the set of quantum states with non-negative Wigner function, is a longstanding open problem. For pure states, the only WPS are Gaussian states, but the situation is considerably more subtle for mixed states. Here, we approach the problem using convex geometry, reducing the question to the characterization of the extreme points of the set of WPS. We give a constructive method to generate a large class of such extreme WPS, which combines the following steps: (i) we characterize the phase-invariant extreme points of the superset of Wigner-positive quasi-states (WPQS); (ii) we introduce a new quantum map, named Vertigo map, which maps extreme WPQS to extreme WPS while preserving phase invariance; (iii) we identify families of extremality-preserving maps and use them to obtain extreme WPS while relaxing phase invariance. Our construction generates all extreme WPS of low dimension, starting from a specific kind of WPS known as beam-splitter states. Our results build upon new mathematical properties of the set of WPS derived in a companion paper and unveil the remarkable structure of mixed states with non-negative Wigner functions.

Abstract: Understanding relaxation in isolated quantum many-body systems remains a central challenge. Recently, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), a counterintuitive relaxation phenomenon, has attracted considerable attention and has been extensively studied in systems with global symmetries. Here, we study the QME in gauge theories with massive local gauge symmetries. In the lattice Schwinger model, we demonstrate that the gauge structure of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is entirely determined by the initial state and remain unchanged during the time evolution. We then investigate whether gauge symmetry can be dynamically restored following a symmetric quench. Analytical and numerical results show that when the Maxwell term is zero, gauge symmetry restoration fails due to the emergence of a peculiar conservation law. However, for any finite Maxwell term, subsystem gauge symmetry is restored in the thermodynamic limit. Based on these results, we systematically construct a families of initial states exhibiting the QME. We further explore the QME in the quantum link model-a truncated lattice Schwinger model, which has been realized in experiments. Moreover, we propose an experimentally accessible order parameter that correctly captures the QME. Our work demonstrates the generality of the quantum Mpemba effect even in the local gauge symmetries, and are directly relevant to ongoing quantum simulation experiments of gauge theories.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Entanglement is often regarded as an inherently quantum feature. We show that this does not have to be the case: under restricted operational access, classical correlations can appear nonseparable when expressed in the formalism of quantum mechanics. If an observer is limited to a constrained set of measurements and transformations, certain classical phase-space distributions can mimic entanglement-like behaviours. Imposing positivity of the associated Hilbert space operator as a physicality requirement removes some of these representational artifacts, revealing a regime in which nonseparability is genuine but still reproducible by classical models. Only when the operational restrictions on the observer are lifted further--allowing operational tests of measurement incompatibility or other nonclassical signatures--does one obtain entanglement that can no longer be captured by any classical description. This operational hierarchy distinguishes classical artifacts, classically reproducible nonseparability, and genuine entanglement.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the decoherence of qubit due to its coupling to a Hermitian or a non-Hermitian bath within the pure dephasing spin-boson model. First, using this model, we analytically establish the previously anticipated similarity between the non-equilibrium and the equilibrium correlation functions $P_x(t)$ and $C_x(t)$. Then, in the short/long time asymptotic behaviors of $P_x(t)$, we find singular dependence on $A$ (coupling strength) and $s$ (bath exponent) at their integer values. Finally, we find that the non-Hermitian bath tends to suppress the decoherence of qubit for all values of $A$ and $s$, in contrast to the conclusion of Dey et al. . Our results show the potential of non-Hermitian environment engineering in suppressing the decoherence of qubit.

Abstract: We develop a quantum metrological framework for resonant nanophotonic sensors based on subwavelength Fabry--Perot slit cavities. Building on classical Fisher-information analyses of resonant transmission sensors, we model parameter encoding as a phase-and-loss quantum channel embedded in one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. We derive the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for coherent and Gaussian probe states under linear loss and show that, even at the quantum limit, optimal estimation precision is governed by the generator of parameter-dependent phase shifts rather than by the cavity quality factor. Consequently, the operating point that maximizes the QFI does not generally coincide with the maximum-Q resonance. Quantum resources enhance sensitivity but do not redefine the optimal geometry. Our results provide physically transparent design principles for quantum-enhanced nanophotonic sensing.

Abstract: Optical quantum computing, as well as quantum communication and sensing technology based on quantum correlations are in preparation. These require photodiodes for the detection of about 10^16 photons per second with close to perfect quantum efficiency. Already the radiometric calibration is a challenge. Here, we provide the theoretical description of the quantum radiometric calibration method. Its foundation is squeezed light and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, making it an example of quantum metrology based on quantum correlations. Unlike all existing radiometric calibration methods, ours is in situ and provides both the detection efficiency and the more stringent quantum efficiency directly for the measurement frequencies of the user application. We calibrate a pair of the most efficient commercially available photodiode at 1550 nm to a system detection efficiency of (97.20 + 0.37)% using 10-dB-squeezed vacuum states. Our method has great potential for significantly higher precision and accuracy, but even with this measurement, we can clearly say that the available photodiode efficiencies for 1550 nm are unexpectedly low, too low for future gravitational wave detectors and for optical quantum computing.

Abstract: We analytically derive the quantum state of a single-photon pulse scattered from a single quantum two-level emitter interacting with a vibrational bath. This solution for the quadripartite system enables an information-theoretic characterization of vibrational effects in quantum light spectroscopy. We show that vibration-induced dephasing reduces the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for estimating the emitter's linewidth, largely reflecting the Franck-Condon suppression of light-matter coupling. Comparing time- and frequency-resolved photodetection, we find the latter to be more informative in estimating the emitter's linewidth for stronger vibrational coupling.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as a versatile and powerful platform for quantum technologies, offering atomic-scale control, strong quantum confinement, and seamless integration into heterogeneous device architectures. Their reduced dimensionality enables unique quantum phenomena, including optically addressable spin defects, tunable single-photon emitters, low-dimensional magnetism, gate-controlled superconductivity, and correlated states in Moiré superlattices. This Roadmap provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress and future directions in exploiting 2D materials for quantum sensing, computation, communication, and simulation. We survey advances spanning spin defects and quantum sensing, quantum emitters and nonlinear photonics, computational theory and data-driven discovery of quantum defects, spintronic and magnonic devices, cavity-engineered quantum materials, superconducting and hybrid quantum circuits, quantum dots, Moiré quantum simulators, and quantum communication platforms. Across these themes, we identify common challenges in defect control, coherence preservation, interfacial engineering, and scalable integration, alongside emerging opportunities driven by machine$-$learning$-$assisted design and integrated experiment$-$theory feedback loops. By connecting microscopic quantum states to mesoscopic excitations and macroscopic device architectures, this Roadmap outlines a materials-centric framework for integrating coherent quantum functionalities and positions 2D materials as foundational building blocks for next-generation quantum technologies.

Abstract: Currently, the progress of quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is impeded by a fundamental trade off among control efficiency, security, and scalability. This study proposes an innovative controlled QSDC protocol based on a collaborative unitary sequence decoding paradigm to break this deadlock.Leveraging four dimensional single particle states, the protocol's core innovation lies in its three party decoding mechanism. The controller's authorization unlocks a specific unitary operation sequence, enabling the receiver to directly decode exclusively via quantum operations, eliminating the need for classical computational algorithms in conventional protocols. This tailored sequence underpins its high efficiency.The protocol also seamlessly incorporates decoy photon authentication, creating a multi layer defense against both external and internal attacks. Consequently, it achieves a remarkable qudit efficiency of 66.7%, offering a significant performance improvement over existing schemes and an efficient, highly secure solution for future quantum networks.

Abstract: First, we investigate the trade-off relations of quantum battery capacities in two-qubit system. We find that the sum of subsystem battery capacity is governed by the total system capacity, with this trade-off relation persisting for a class of Hamiltonians, including Ising, XX, XXZ and XXX models. Then building on this relation, we define residual battery capacity for general quantum states and establish coherent/incoherent components of subsystem battery capacity. Furthermore, we introduce the protocol to guide the selection of appropriate incoherent unitary operations for enhancing subsystem battery capacity in specific scenarios, along with a sufficient condition for achieving subsystem capacity gain through unitary operation. Numerical examples validate the feasibility of the incoherent operation protocol. Additionally, for the three-qubit system, we also established a set of theories and results parallel to those for two-qubit case. Finally, we determine the minimum time required to enhance subsystem battery capacity via a single incoherent operation in our protocol. Our findings contribute to the development of quantum battery theory and quantum energy storage systems.

Abstract: Exploring the shareability and distribution of entanglement possesses fundamental significance in quantum information tasks. In this paper, we demonstrate that the square of bipartite entanglement measures $G_q$-concurrence, which is the generalization of concurrence, follows a set of hierarchical monogamy relations for any $N$-qubit quantum state. On the basis of these monogamy inequalities, we render two kinds of hierarchical indicators that exhibit evident advantages in the capacity of witnessing entanglement. Moreover, we show an analytical relation between $G_q$-concurrence and concurrence in $2\otimes d$ systems. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that the monogamy property of squared $G_q$-concurrence is superior to that of squared concurrence in $2\otimes d_2\otimes d_3\otimes\cdots\otimes d_N$ systems. In addition, several concrete examples are provided to illustrate that for multilevel systems, the squared $G_q$-concurrence satisfies the monogamy relation, even if the squared concurrence does not. These results better reveal the intriguing characteristic of multilevel entanglement and provide critical insights into the entanglement distribution within multipartite quantum systems.

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an important resource for quantum information processing. It has been shown that it is possible to employ alkali atoms to implement single device multipartite entanglement by using nonlinear processes with spatial modes. This work presents the first microscopic description of such multi-mode generation with two-pump four wave mixing (4WM) in dense atomic media. We implement an extension of a double $Λ$ model for a single pump 4WM in order to describe the multi-mode generation with a two-pump configuration. We propose a Floquet expansion to solve the multimode gain amplification and noise properties. The model describes the angle and the two-photon dependency of the multimode generation and the quantum correlations among the modes. We investigate the entanglement properties of the system, describing the main properties of previous experimental observations. Such a microscopic description can be used to predict the gain distribution of modes and the quantum correlation within a typical range of experimental parameters.

Abstract: (Abridged.) This thesis investigates scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation through the development of bosonic quantum codes, quantum LDPC codes, and decoding protocols that connect continuous-variable and discrete-variable error correction. We investigate superconducting microwave implementations of continuous-variable quantum computing, including the deterministic generation of cubic phase states, and introduce the dissipatively stabilized squeezed cat qubit, a noise-biased bosonic encoding with enhanced error suppression and faster gates. The performance of rotation-symmetric and GKP codes is analyzed under realistic noise and measurement models, revealing key trade-offs in measurement-based schemes. To integrate bosonic codes into larger architectures, we develop decoding methods that exploit analog syndrome information, enabling quasi-single-shot decoding in concatenated systems. On the discrete-variable side, we introduce localized statistics decoding, a highly parallelizable decoder for quantum LDPC codes, and propose quantum radial codes, a new family of single-shot LDPC codes with low overhead and strong circuit-level performance. Finally, we present fault complexes, a homological framework for analyzing faults in dynamic quantum error correction protocols. Extending the role of homology in static CSS codes, fault complexes provide a general language for the design and analysis of fault-tolerant schemes.

Abstract: With intensive studies of quantum thermodynamics, the quantum batteries (QBs) have been proposed to store and transfer energy via quantum effects. Despite many theoretical models, decoherence remains a severe challenge and practical platforms are still rare. Here we propose the QB based on the degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO), using the signal field as the energy-storage unit. We carefully separate the ergotropy into coherent and incoherent components and find that the coherent part decays roughly half as slowly as the incoherent part. More importantly, the coherent ergotropy and the average charging power reach their respective maxima at essentially the same moment, i.e., $γ_s t \approx 10$. This coincidence defines the optimal instant to switch off the pump. Finally, coupling the QB to a two-level system (TLS) as the load, we demonstrate an efficient discharge process of the QB. Our work establishes a realistic and immediately-implementable QB architecture on a mature optical platform.

Abstract: Microwave storage and retrieval are essential capabilities for superconducting quantum circuits. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip multimode resonator in which strong parametric modulation induces a large and tunable normal-mode splitting that enables microwave storage. When the spectral bandwidth of a short microwave pulse covers the two dressed-state absorption peaks, part of the pulse is absorbed and undergoes coherent energy exchange between the modes, producing a clear time-domain beating signal. By switching off the modulation before the beating arrives, we realize on-demand storage and retrieval, demonstrating an alternative approach to microwave photonic quantum memory. This parametric-normal-mode-splitting protocol offers a practical route toward a controllable quantum-memory mechanism in superconducting circuits.

We illustrate this condition with examples of two-qubit state ensembles consisting of two orthogonal separable states. As our data-hiding scheme can be implemented with separable states of the lowest possible dimension, its practical realization becomes significantly more attainable.

Abstract: Grover's search algorithm is the cornerstone of many applications of quantum computing, providing a quadratic speed-up over classical methods. One limitation of the algorithm is that it requires knowledge of the number of solutions to obtain an optimal success probability, due to the oscillatory dynamics between the initial and solutions states (the ``soufflé problem''). While various methods have been proposed to solve this problem, each has their drawbacks in terms of inefficiency or sensitivity to control errors. Here, we modify Grover's algorithm to eliminate the oscillatory dynamics, such that the search proceeds as an exponential decay into the solution states. The basic idea is to convert the solution states into a reservoir by using ancilla qubits such that the initial state is nonreflectively absorbed. Trotterizing the continuous algorithm yields a quantum circuit that gives equivalent performance, which has the same quadratic quantum speedup as the original algorithm.

Abstract: Blind Quantum Computation lets a limited-capability client delegate its complex computation to a remote server without revealing its data or computation. Several such protocols have been proposed under varied quantum computing models. However, these protocols either rely on highly entangled resource states (in measurement-based models) or are based on non-parametric resource sets (in circuit-based models). These restrictions hinder the practical applicability of such an algorithm in the NISQ era, especially concerning the hybrid quantum-classical infrastructure, which depends on parametric gates. We present a protocol for universal blind quantum computation based on recursive decryption of parametric rotation gates, which does not require a highly entangled state at the server side and substantially reduces the communication rounds required for practical prototyping of secure variational algorithms.

Abstract: We develop a composite operational architecture for sequential quantum measurements that (i) gives a tight bipartite order-effect bound with an explicit equality set characterized on the Halmos two-subspace block, (ii) upgrades Doeblin-type minorization to composite instruments and proves a product lower bound for the operational Doeblin constants, yielding data-driven exponential mixing rates, (iii) derives a diamond-norm commutator bound that quantifies how serial and parallel rearrangements influence observable deviations, and (iv) establishes a monitored Lindblad limit that links discrete look-return loops to continuous-time GKLS dynamics under transparent assumptions. Building on the GKLS framework of Gorini, Kossakowski, Sudarshan, Lindblad, Davies, Spohn, and later work of Fagnola-Rebolledo and Lami et al., we go beyond asymptotic statements by providing finite-sample certificates for the minorization parameter via exact binomial intervals and propagating them to rigorous bounds on the number of interaction steps required to attain a prescribed accuracy. A minimal qubit toy model and CSV-based scripts are supplied for full reproducibility. Our results position order-effect control and operational mixing on a single quantitative axis, from equality windows for pairs of projections to certified network mixing under monitoring. The framework targets readers in quantum information and quantum foundations who need explicit constants that are estimable from data and transferable to device-level guarantees.

Abstract: Quantum indistinguishability of non-orthogonal quantum states is a valuable resource in quantum information applications such as cryptography and randomness generation. In this article, we present a sequential state-discrimination scheme that enables multiple parties to share quantum uncertainty, in terms of the max relative entropy, generated by a single party. Our scheme is based upon maximum-confidence measurements and takes advantages of weak measurements to allow a number of parties to perform state discrimination on a single quantum system. We review known sequential state discrimination and show how our scheme would work through a number of examples where ensembles may or may not contain symmetries. Our results will have a role to play in understanding the ultimate limits of sequential information extraction and guide the development of quantum resource sharing in sequential settings.

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enables two remote parties to establish information-theoretically secure keys and offers high practical feasibility due to its compatibility with mature coherent optical communication technologies. However, as CV-QKD systems progress toward digital implementations, device nonidealities drive the optical field from a single-mode to a continuous-mode region, thereby underscoring the mismatch between theoretical models and practical systems. Here, we introduce temporal modes to construct an entanglement-based scheme that more accurately captures device nonidealities and develop a corresponding secret key rate calculation method applicable to continuous-mode scenarios. We demonstrate that optimizing the pulse-shaping format can significantly improve performance under detector-bandwidth-limited conditions. Experimental results also confirm that the proposed model effectively describes the impact of sampling-time deviations. We further analyze a linear weighted-reconstruction digital signal processing method,which improves the secret key rate by approximately 50% in a 30-km fiber experiment without requiring additional hardware, demonstrating a substantial performance enhancement at metropolitan distances. The proposed theoretical framework accommodates a broader range of experimental conditions and can guide the optimization of digital CV-QKD systems.

Abstract: Quantum computers pose a fundamental threat to widely deployed public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA and ECC, by enabling efficient integer factorization using Shor's algorithm. Theoretical resource estimates suggest that 2048-bit RSA keys could be broken using Shor's algorithm with fewer than a million noisy qubits. Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers. In particular, we observe that circuit constructions still need to be highly specific for each modulus, and that machine fidelities are unstable, with high and fluctuating error rates.

Abstract: We propose a quantum analogue of Bluestein's algorithm (QBA) that implements an exact $N$-point Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) for arbitrary $N$. Our construction factors the $N$-dimensional QFT unitary into three diagonal quadratic-phase gates and two standard radix-2 QFT subcircuits of size $M = 2^m$ (with $M \ge 2N - 1$). This achieves asymptotic gate complexity $O((\log N)^2)$ and uses $O(\log N)$ qubits, matching the performance of a power-of-two QFT on $m$ qubits while avoiding the need to embed into a larger Hilbert space. We validate the correctness of the algorithm through a concrete implementation in Qiskit and classical simulation, confirming that QBA produces the exact $N$-point discrete Fourier transform on arbitrary-length inputs.

Abstract: The detection and characterization of quantum coherence is of fundamental importance both in the foundations of quantum theory as well as for the rapidly developing field of quantum technologies, where coherence has been linked to quantum advantage. Typical approaches for detecting coherence employ {\it coherence witnesses} -- observable quantities whose expectation value can be used to certify the presence of coherence. By design, coherence witnesses are only able to detect coherence for some, but not all, possible states of a quantum system. In this work we construct protocols capable of detecting the presence of coherence in an {\it unknown} pure quantum state $|ψ\rangle$. Having access to $m$ copies of an unknown pure state $|ψ\rangle$ we show that the sample complexity of any experimental procedure for detecting coherence with constant probability of success $\ge 2/3$ is $Θ(c(|ψ\rangle)^{-1})$, where $c(|ψ\rangle)$ is the geometric measure of coherence of $|ψ\rangle$. However, assuming access to the unitary $U_ψ$ which prepares the unknown state $|ψ\rangle$, and its inverse $U_ψ^\dagger$, we devise a coherence detecting protocol that employs amplitude-amplification {\it a la} Grover, and uses a quadratically smaller number $O(c(|ψ\rangle)^{-1/2})$ of samples. Furthermore, by augmenting amplitude amplification with phase estimation we obtain an experimental estimation of upper bounds on the geometric measure of coherence within additive error $\varepsilon$ with a sample complexity that scales as $O(1/\varepsilon)$ as compared to the $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ sample complexity of Monte Carlo estimation methods. The average number of samples needed in our amplitude estimation protocol provides a new operational interpretation for the geometric measure of coherence. Finally, we also derive bounds on the amount of noise our protocols are able to tolerate.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic security by leveraging quantum mechanics, yet the cost and complexity of dedicated hardware and fiber infrastructure have so far limited large-scale deployment and experimentation. In this paper, we introduce Quditto, an automated open-access emulation platform that combines high-fidelity quantum-channel modeling with a standardized key-delivery API, enabling users to interact with the emulated network exactly as they would with real QKD hardware. Quditto modular design supports pluggable protocol implementations, complex key management schemes and detailed channel models, including variable attenuation and decoherence. We validate Quditto by deploying networks of various sizes and demonstrate its flexibility through two proof-of-concept scenarios featuring eavesdropper attacks and heterogeneous channel conditions.

Abstract: We introduce a framework that unifies quantum measurement dynamics, Hamiltonian dynamics, and double-bracket gradient flows. We do so by providing explicit expressions for stochastic Hamiltonians that produce state dynamics identical to those that happen during continuous quantum measurements. When such dynamical processes are integrated over sufficiently long time intervals, they yield the same results and statistics as during wavefunction collapse. That is, wavefunction collapse can be interpreted as coarse-grained (stochastic) Hamiltonian dynamics. Alternatively, wavefunction collapse can be interpreted as double-bracket gradient flows determined by derivatives of (stochastic) potentials defined in terms of observables with direct physical interpretations. The gradient flows minimize the variance of the monitored observable. Our derivations hold for general monitoring described by non-Hermitian jump processes. We show that such reinterpretations of measurement dynamics facilitate the design of feedback processes. In particular, we introduce feedback processes that yield deterministic double-bracket flow equations, which prepare ground states of a target Hamiltonian, and feedback processes for state preparation. We conclude by re-interpreting feedback processes as gradient flows with tilted fixed points.

Abstract: Informationally complete measurements form the foundation of universal quantum state reconstruction, while quantum parameter estimation is based on the local structure of the manifold of quantum states. Here we establish a general link between these two aspects, in the context of a single informationally complete measurement, by employing a suitably adapted operator frame theory. In particular, we bound the ratio between the classical and quantum Fisher information in terms of the spectral decomposition of the associated frame operator, and connect these bounds to the optimal and least optimal directions for parameter encoding. The geometric and operational characterization of information extraction thus obtained reveals the fundamental tradeoff imposed by informational completeness on local quantum parameter estimation.

A series of experiments apply the method and demonstrate its ability to realize complex scattering processes involving many modes at microwave frequencies, including non-reciprocal mode circulation. We also present an approximate method to dynamically control mode scattering, capable of rapidly routing signals between modes in a prescribed manner. These methods are useful tools for encoding and manipulating continuous variable quantum information with multi-modal Gaussian states.

Abstract: The recently available high-intensity quantum light pulses provide novel tools for controlling light-matter interactions. However, the rigor of the theoretical frameworks currently used to describe the interaction of strong quantum light with atoms and molecules remains unverified. Here, we establish a rigorous benchmark by solving the fully quantized time-dependent Schrödinger equation for an atom exposed to bright squeezed vacuum light. Our \textit{ab initio} simulations reveal a critical limitation of the widely used $Q$-representation: although it accurately reproduces the total photoelectron spectrum after tracing over photon states, it completely fails to capture the electron-photon joint energy spectrum. To overcome this limitation, we develop a general theoretical framework based on the Feynman path integral that properly incorporates the electron-photon quantum entanglement. Our results provide both quantitative benchmarks and fundamental theoretical insights for the emerging field of strong-field quantum optics.

Abstract: Cloud-based quantum computers do not provide users with access to hardware-level information such as the underlying Hamiltonians, which obstructs the characterization of their physical properties. We propose a method to infer the energy scales of gate Hamiltonians in such black-box quantum processors using only user-accessible data, by exploiting quantum speed limits. Specifically, we reinterpret the Margolus-Levitin and Mandelstam-Tamm bounds as estimators of the energy expectation value and variance, respectively, and relate them to the shortest time for the processor to orthogonalize a quantum state. This shortest gate time, expected to lie on the nanosecond scale, is inferred from job execution times measured in seconds by employing gate-time amplification. We apply the method to IBM's superconducting quantum processor and estimate the energy scales associated with single-, two-, and three-qubit gates. The order of estimated energy is consistent with typical drive energies in superconducting qubit systems, suggesting that current gate operations approach the quantum speed limit. Our results demonstrate that fundamental energetic properties of black-box quantum computers can be quantitatively accessed through operational time measurements, reflecting the conjugate relationship between time and energy imposed by the uncertainty principle.

Abstract: Dynamic programming is a cornerstone of graph-based optimization. While effective, it scales unfavorably with problem size. In this work, we present QuantGraph, a two-stage quantum-enhanced framework that casts local and global graph-optimization problems as quantum searches over discrete trajectory spaces. The solver is designed to operate efficiently by first finding a sequence of locally optimal transitions in the graph (local stage), without considering full trajectories. The accumulated cost of these transitions acts as a threshold that prunes the search space (up to 60% reduction for certain examples). The subsequent global stage, based on this threshold, refines the solution. Both stages utilize variants of the Grover-adaptive-search algorithm. To achieve scalability and robustness, we draw on principles from control theory and embed QuantGraph's global stage within a receding-horizon model-predictive-control scheme. This classical layer stabilizes and guides the quantum search, improving precision and reducing computational burden. In practice, the resulting closed-loop system exhibits robust behavior and lower overall complexity. Notably, for a fixed query budget, QuantGraph attains a 2x increase in control-discretization precision while still benefiting from Grover-search's inherent quadratic speedup compared to classical methods.

Abstract: We find the maximum rate achievable in the private communication over a bosonic quantum channel with a fully Gaussian protocol based on optimal single-mode Gaussian measurements. This rate establishes a lower bound on the secret rate capacity of the channel. We focus on the class of phase-insensitive Gaussian channels. For the thermal-loss and thermal amplification channels, our results demonstrate the optimality, within the constraints of our analysis, of previously proposed protocols, while also providing a significantly simplified formula for their performance evaluation. For the added noise channel, our rate provides a better lower bound than any previously known.

Abstract: Environmental decoherence occurs when a quantum system interacts with its surroundings, progressively reducing quantum interference and coherence, complicating the preservation of critical quantum properties over time, especially during experimental implementation. The effect of decoherence varies depending on the phase-space features of quantum states, which are theoretically characterized by the Wigner phase space and appear at different scales. We explore the compass state and its photon-added and photon-subtracted variants, each of which exhibits phase-space features with dimensions beyond the Planck scale, making them suitable for quantum sensing applications. We investigate the interaction of these states with a heat reservoir by employing a range of well-established theoretical techniques, revealing a clear tradeoff between the degree of fineness in the smallest features, such as the sub-Planck structure, and the extent of decoherence. Specifically, increasing the parameters enhances sub-Planck precision in phase space, concomitantly amplifying the fragility of these compass states to undesired decoherence. Our general illustration, validated through these compass states, also applies to any pure quantum state interacting with the considered heat reservoir, exhibiting enhanced sustainability of features at larger phase-space extensions.

In contrast to Dicke batteries, the power enhancement arises from a $N^2$ scaling of both quantum correlations and speed of evolution, thus highlighting genuine quantum advantage. Moreover, this hybrid setup is experimentally realizable and ensures that power enhancement is not achieved at significant cost to energy efficiency, while allowing for greater tunability and stable operation in the presence of noise.

Abstract: Molecular spin qudits based on lanthanide complexes offer a promising platform for quantum technologies, combining chemical tunability with multi-level encoding. However, experimental demonstrations of their envisaged capabilities remain scarce, posing the difficulty of achieving precise control over coherences between qudit states in long pulse sequences. Here, we implement in 173Yb(trensal) qudit the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), a core component of numerous quantum algorithms, storing quantum information in the phases of coherences. QFT provides an ideal benchmark for coherence manipulation and an unprecedented challenge for molecular spin qudits. We address this challenge by embedding a full-refocusing protocol for spin qudits in our algorithm, mitigating inhomogeneous broadening and enabling a high-fidelity recovery of the state. Complete state tomography demostrates the performance of the algorithm, while simulations provide insight into the physical mechanisms behind inhomogeneous broadening. This work shows the feasibility of quantum logic on molecular spin qudits and highlights their potential.

Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states of light are essential resources for quantum information processing and precision metrology. Among them, generalized coherent states (GCS), which naturally arise from the evolution of a coherent state with a nonlinear medium, exhibit useful quantum features such as Wigner negativity and metrological advantages [Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013165 (2023)]. Because these states remain coherent to all orders, their nonclassical character cannot be revealed through standard intensity-intensity correlation measurements. Here, we demonstrate that the intensity-field correlation function alone provides a simple and experimentally accessible witness of nonclassicality. For GCSs, any deviation of this normalized correlation from unity signals nonclassical behavior. We derive analytical results for Kerr-generated states and extend the analysis to statistical mixtures of GCSs. The proposed approach enables real-time, low-complexity detection of quantum signatures in non-Gaussian states, offering a practical tool for experiments across a broad range of nonlinear regimes.

Abstract: Entanglement and Bell nonlocality are known to be inequivalent: there exist entangled states that admit a local hidden-variable model for all local measurements. Here we show that this gap disappears in a minimal broadcast extension of the Bell scenario. Assuming only the validity of quantum theory, we prove that for every entangled state $ρ_{AB}$ there exist local broadcasting maps and local measurements such that the resulting four--partite correlations cannot be reproduced by any broadcast network whose source is separable across the $A|B$ cut. Thus, all entangled states are broadcast nonlocal in quantum theory. In addition, we show that all (also mixed) multipartite states can be broadcast-self-tested, according to a natural operational definition.

Abstract: Demonstrating quantum advantage in machine learning tasks requires navigating a complex landscape of proposed models and algorithms. To bring clarity to this search, we introduce a framework that connects the structure of parametrized quantum circuits to the mathematical nature of the functions they can actually learn. Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth and non-Clifford gate count, directly determine whether a model's output leads to efficient classical simulation or surrogation. We argue that this analysis uncovers common pathways to dequantization that underlie many existing simulation methods. More importantly, it reveals critical distinctions between models that are fully simulatable, those whose function space is classically tractable, and those that remain robustly quantum. This perspective provides a conceptual map of this landscape, clarifying how different models relate to classical simulability and pointing to where opportunities for quantum advantage may lie.

Abstract: Graph-theoretic structures play a central role in the description and analysis of quantum systems. In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum states, called $A_α$-graph states, which are constructed from either unweighted or weighted graphs by taking the normalised convex combination of the degree matrix $D$ and the adjacency matrix $A_G$ of a graph $G$. The constructed states are different from the standard graph states arising from stabiliser formalism. Our approach is also different from the approach used by Braunstein et al. This class of states depend on a tunable mixing parameter $α\in (0,1]$. We first establish the conditions under which the associated operator $ρ_α^{A_G}$ is positive semidefinite and hence represents a valid quantum state. We then derive a positive partial transposition (PPT) condition for $A_α$-graph states in terms of graph parameters. This PPT condition involves only the Frobenius norm of the adjacency matrix of the graph, the degrees of the vertices and the total number of vertices. For simple graphs, we obtain the range of the parameter $α$ for which the $A_α$-graph states represent a class of entangled states. We then develop a graph-theoretic formulation of a moments-based entanglement detection criterion, focusing on the recently proposed $p_3$-PPT criterion, which relies on the second and third moments of the partial transposition. Since the estimation of these moments is experimentally accessible via randomised measurements, swap operations, and machine-learning-based protocols, our approach provides a physically relevant framework for detecting entanglement in structured quantum states derived from graphs. This work bridges graph theory and moments-based entanglement detection, offering a new perspective on the role of combinatorial structures in quantum correlations.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computers use decoders to monitor for errors and find a plausible correction. A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements.

Abstract: The random purification channel maps n copies of any mixed quantum state to n copies of a random purification of the state. We generalize this construction to arbitrary symmetries: for any group G of unitaries, we construct a quantum channel that maps states contained in the algebra generated by G to random purifications obtained by twirling over G. In addition to giving a surprisingly concise proof of the original random purification theorem, our result implies the existence of fermionic and bosonic Gaussian purification channels. As applications, we obtain the first tomography protocol for fermionic Gaussian states that scales optimally with the number of modes and the error, as well as an improved property test for this class of states.

Abstract: A simple theoretical model is developed to describe spin reorientation (SR) transitions in rare-earth orthoferrites and orthochromites RFeO3 and RCrO3. Within a ``single-doublet'' approach, the free energy includes anisotropy contributions from the 3d-sublattice and the splitting of the lower doublet of 4f-ions. The model predicts various types of SR transitions - first-order, second-order, and mixed - depending on anisotropy parameters. Effects of non-magnetic dilution, heat capacity anomalies, and behavior of the rare-earth magnetic moment in the SR region are analyzed.

Abstract: Decisive experimental confirmation of the $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid phase in quantum spin ice remains an outstanding challenge. In this work, we propose stray-field magnetometry as a direct probe of the emergent photons -- the gapless excitation of the emergent electrodynamics in quantum spin ice. The emergent photons are transverse magnetization waves, which, in a finite sample, form discrete modes governed by one of two sets of natural boundary conditions: ``insulating'' or ``superconducting''. Considering cavity and thin film geometries, we find that the spectrum and spatial structure of the stray magnetic noise provide a sharp qualitative signature of the underlying electrodynamics. The predicted stray-field noise power lies comfortably within the detection range of present-day solid-state defect magnetometry.

Abstract: We assess the accuracy of the cumulant expansion (CE) method, combined with the independent-particle approximation (IPA), for calculating charge mobility in electron-phonon systems. As representative testbeds, we consider the Peierls and Fröhlich models, which serve as simplified frameworks where accurate or numerically exact benchmarks are available. These are used to compare the CE results with those obtained using the Boltzmann formalism, the Migdal approximation, and its self consistent extension-approaches that are presently the most commonly employed alternatives for transport calculations. Supported by analytical arguments based on spectral sum rules and by our previous results for the Holstein model, we argue that, for weak to moderate coupling strengths and not-too-low temperatures, the CE within the IPA framework yields accurate results. In the case of the Peierls model, the role of vertex corrections is also discussed.

Abstract: The recent experimental observations of high temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate have attracted lots of attentions. Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects.

Abstract: Triangular-lattice cobaltates with glaserite-type $X_2Y$Co($T$O$_4)_2$ structure provide an ideal platform to investigate intriguing quantum magnetism. Here we report a comprehensive study of the structural and magnetic properties of a triangular-lattice cobalt vanadate $\rm Na_2SrCo(VO_4)_2$. Room-temperature x-ray and neutron powder diffraction confirm that $\rm Na_2SrCo(VO_4)_2$ crystallizes in the monoclinic $P2_1/c$ space group with slightly distorted triangular layers of $\rm Co^{2+}$ ions. Magnetization measurements reveal a ferromagnetic transition at $T\rm_C \approx 3.4~{\rm K}$, where a sharp $λ$-type anomaly is observed in the specific heat. The magnetic entropy recovered up to 55 K approaches 90$\%$ of $R{\rm ln}2$, supporting an effective spin-1/2 state of Co$^{2+}$ ions at low temperature. Neutron diffraction at 2.3 K (below $T_{\rm C}$) further confirms a long-range canted ferromagnetic order with the Co$^{2+}$ moments aligned in the $ac$ plane and the ordered moment size of $\sim$ 2.6 $μ\rm_{B}$. Comparing with its sister compounds with a trigonal symmetry, $\rm Na_2BaCo(VO_4)_2$ with a collinear ferromagnetic structure and the recently discovered spin supersolid candidate $\rm Na_2BaCo(PO_4)_2$ with a distinct Y-like antiferromagnetic ground state, this study indicates the decisive role of the $T{\rm O_4}$ tetrahedra in tuning exchange interactions and contrasting magnetic behaviors of these glaserite-structure compounds.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of several quasiperiodic disorders and their continuous interpolation with the Aubry-Andre (AA) potential on the Hofstadter butterfly using mean field approximation at zero temperature for a two-dimensional square lattice. Weak disorder mildly smears the fractal spectrum, while strong quasiperiodic potentials destroy the butterfly and generate multiple energy gaps. The AA potential produces the strongest spectral restructuring, creating prominent gaps near half-filling. Interpolating AA with other quasiperiodic potentials reveals competing gap-opening mechanisms, ranging from AA-dominated gaps at small interpolation parameters to a robust half-filling gap generated by the competing disorders at large parameters. Entanglement entropy follows the area law at low and high magnetic fields but shows pronounced deviations at intermediate fields, with opposite trends for strong AA versus other quasiperiodic potentials. Localization analysis using IPR and NPR confirms enhanced localization with increasing disorder; the AA potential yields the largest IPR, with notable field dependence. Interpolation produces smooth crossovers between distinct localization regimes.

Abstract: Narrow-gap Mott insulators promise exceptional opportunities for voltage-controlled magnetic textures in low-dissipation spintronics, although their prediction remains challenging. Here we employ a density functional theory-guided approach to predict a narrow charge-transfer gap (127 meV) in the chiral cubic frustrated oxide Co$_5$TeO$_8$. Comprehensive neutron scattering and magnetometry reveal proper-screw Bloch-type helices with field- and temperature-tunable pitch of 5.7-10 nm embedded in a complex phase diagram with eight distinct phases. Ab initio wavefunction calculations demonstrate site-dependent single-ion anisotropy exceeding Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions by an order of magnitude, establishing the anisotropy-frustration interplay as the stabilization mechanism, contrasting starkly with DM-dominated cubic helimagnets. Sharp capacitance anomalies at phase boundaries confirm intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling throughout the phase diagram. Co$_5$TeO$_8$ thus provides a platform for voltage-tunable sub-10 nm magnetic textures, demonstrating effective theory-guided discovery of functional magnetic materials in correlated oxides.

Abstract: Intrinsically topologically ordered phases can host anyons. Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.

Abstract: At strong on-site repulsion $ U $, the fermionic Hubbard model realizes an extremely correlated electron system. In this regime, it is natural to derive the low-energy physics with the help of non-canonical operators acting on a projected Hilbert space without double occupancies. Using a strong-coupling functional renormalization group technique, we study the physics of such extreme correlations in the strict $ U = \infty $ limit, where only kinematic interactions due to the Hilbert space projection remain. For nearest-neighbor hopping on a square lattice, we find that the electronic spectrum is significantly renormalized, with bandwidth and quasi-particle residue strongly decreasing with increasing electron density. On the other hand, damping and particle-hole asymmetry increase, while a polaronic continuum forms in the hole sector, below the single-particle band. Fermi liquid phenomenology applies only at low densities, where the system remains paramagnetic. At higher densities, we find a bad metal with strong magnetic correlations, indicating that the ground state is the Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities and a stripe antiferromagnet at intermediate densities. Both in the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic regimes, we observe a violation of Luttinger's theorem.

Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium driven dynamics at topologically nontrivial quantum critical points (QCPs),and find that topological edge modes at criticality give rise to anomalous universal dynamical scaling behavior. By analyzing the driven dynamics of bulk and boundary order parameters at topologically distinct Ising QCPs, we demonstrate that, while the bulk dynamics remain indistinguishable and follow standard Kibble Zurek (KZ) scaling, the anomalous boundary dynamics is unique to topological criticality, and its explanation goes beyond the traditional KZ mechanism. To elucidate the unified origin of this anomaly, we further study the dynamics of defect production at topologically distinct QCPs in free-fermion models and demonstrate similar anomalous universal scaling exclusive to topological criticality. These findings establish the existence of anomalous dynamical scaling arising from the interplay between topology and driven dynamics, challenging standard paradigms of quantum critical dynamics.

Abstract: Magnetic octupole (MO) currents have recently attracted significant attention as a driving force for the Neel vector dynamics in d-wave altermagnets, a new class of antiferromagnets that exhibit nonrelativistic spin-split band structures. From a symmetry perspective, the MO includes an axial-dipole component analogous to that of the spin, making it essential to clarify how MO currents differ from spin currents. We here investigate the correspondence between MO conductivities and electronic multipoles, which provide a unified and powerful framework for symmetry analysis. We derive the multipole representation of the rank-five MO conductivity tensor and classify its symmetry-allowed components for all crystallographic point groups, in direct comparison with spin conductivity. We show that time-reversal-even electric-type multipoles give rise to the dissipationless MO current, whereas time-reversal-odd magnetic-type multipoles generate dissipative MO current under an applied electric field. Complementing this macroscopic analysis, the linear-response calculations for a microscopic tight-binding model demonstrate how MO conductivities are activated by symmetry lowering, exemplified by the symmetry reduction from Oh to Th. Our results elucidate the symmetry distinctions between MO currents and spin currents, and provide insights into their experimental identification.

Abstract: Spin-charge stripes belong to the most prominent low-temperature orders besides superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors. This phase is particularly challenging to study numerically due to finite-size effects. By investigating the formation of long, isolated stripes, we offer a perspective complementary to typical finite-doping phase diagrams. We use the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm to extract the ground states of an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry, making the diameter significantly wider than in previous works. This approach allows us to map out the range of possible stripe filling fractions on the electron versus hole-doped side. We find good agreement with established results, suggesting that the spread of filling fractions observed in the literature is governed by the physics of a single stripe. Taking a microscopic look at stripe formation, we reveal two separate regimes - a high-filling regime captured by a simplified squeezed-space model and a low-filling regime characterized by the structure of individual pairs of dopants. Thereby, we trace back the phenomenology of the striped phase to its microscopic constituents and highlight the different challenges for observing the two regimes in quantum simulation experiments.
