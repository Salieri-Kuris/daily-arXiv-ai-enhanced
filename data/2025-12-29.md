Abstract: The effective interaction between composite fermions, set entirely by the Coulomb potential and the underlying electronic Landau level orbitals, can stabilize exotic fractional quantum Hall states. In particular, half-filled Landau levels with different orbital character can host either metallic or paired phases of composite fermions. Here, we leverage experimental control over the orbital composition to realize a composite-fermion pairing transition in the first excited Landau level of bilayer graphene. Transport measurements at filling factors v = 9/2 and 11/2 reveal conductive states giving way to well-developed plateaus with increasing displacement fields. These states are insensitive to an in-plane magnetic field, indicating single-component ground states and thus pointing at non-Abelian orders. Our numerical study, based on displacement-field-dependent Landau-level wavefunctions, supports the orbital origin of the pairing transition and suggests Moore-Read or anti-Pfaffian ground states.

Abstract: Intrinsic magnetic topological insulators can host quantum states with quantized magneto-electric responses, such as the axion and Chern insulators states evidenced in ultra-thin MnBi2Te4 films. Yet, whereas quantization is investigated thoroughly, transport properties related to the phase of charge carriers remains unexplored. Here, we study quantum coherent transport in mesoscopic Hall bars fabricated from thick exfoliated MnBi2Te4 flakes, and reveal the longest phase-coherence length ever observed in a mesoscopic magnet (about 500nm at 1K), associated to 2D topological surface states. In the fully-coherent regime, significant non-local contributions to quantum interference up to the micron scale lead to giant-amplitude universal conductance fluctuations (about 20e2/h). In the self-averaging regime, the statistical properties of conductance fluctuations confirm the 2D nature of quantum interference and different dephasing mechanisms are identified, as due to either magnetism or magnetic flux through coherent loops. Remarkably, the weak decoherence in magnetic topological insulator nanostructures show their potential to realize novel quantum spin interferometers based on dephasing by local magnetic textures at liquid-helium temperatures.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian topological phase, with the novel concepts such as exceptional points and skin effect, has opened up a new paradigm beyond Hermitian topological physics. Exceptional ring semimetal, featured by a stable ring of exceptional points in three dimensions, exhibits first-order topological properties, including topological surface states and surface-dependent skin effect. Nevertheless, despite extensive research on Hermitian higher-order insulators and semimetals, higher-order exceptional ring semimetal is just emerging. Here, we report the first realization of a higher-order Weyl exceptional ring semimetal in a three-dimensional lossy phononic crystal. The non-Hermitian higher-order topology reflects in the topological hinge states and hinge-dependent skin effect. Counterintuitively, the topological hinge states maintain purely real energy even under a high loss level, ensuring robust hinge-state propagation. Our findings evidence the non-Hermitian higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence of exceptional ring semimetal, and may pave the way to non-Hermitian functional acoustic devices.

Abstract: Graphene-based moire superlattices exhibit novel quantum phenomena driven by pronounced interactions, leading to topological corrected states like orbital Chern insulators exhibiting quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Typically, intrinsic Chern insulators are stabilized at odd moiré fillings, as even fillings often result in valley-balanced, topologically trivial states at zero magnetic field. In our work, we report the observation of an intrinsic Chern insulator with C = 1 state at moire filling v = 2 in rhombohedral octalayer graphene (R8G)/hBN moire superlattice. Observing such Chern insulators in particular with C = 1 at v = 2 is intriguing, as each moiré band carries Chern number C = 1 or -1. We further demonstrate such a state can originate from the entanglement between the low-energy moire flat bands and high-energy remote bands according to the Hartree-Fock calculation. Our findings extend the known topological phase diagram of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) moire systems and establish this platform as highly promising for investigating strong electron correlations and multiband hybridized transport.

Result: Discovery of rich states with high Chern numbers, including Chern insulators with C = 4 and 3 at v = 1, a series from C = 2 to C = 7 around v = 3, and an exotic fractional Chern insulator with C = 7/3 around v = 2/3.

Conclusion: This work expands the understanding of fractionally charged excitations beyond the Landau level basis and offers a new moiré platform for exploring anyons.

Abstract: The realization of fractional Chern insulators opens up the possibility of exploring fractionally charged excitations and anyonic statistics in the absence of a magnetic field. One of the central questions is whether lattice-based systems can give rise to radically new states, distinct from those observed in traditional fractional quantum Hall systems. In this work, we investigate a new type of moire flat band system composed of Bernal bilayer graphene and rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. First, we discover an unprecedented richness of states with high Chern numbers. At v = 1 moire filling, we observe Chern insulators with Chern numbers C = 4 and 3. Flanking v = 3 state, we observe a series of Chern insulators from C = 2 to C = 7. All of these states exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Remarkably, we observe an exotic fractional Chern insulator with C = 7/3 around v = 2/3 which is beyond all known fractional Chern insulators described by either the Jain sequence as or current high Chern theory. Our work expands the understanding of fractionally charged excitations beyond the Landau level basis and offers a new moiré platform for exploring anyons.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The aim was to investigate how the intrinsic electronic properties of topological insulators influence interface stability and dynamics, contrasting with conventional crystal growth mechanisms.

Method: The authors derive an effective equation of interface growth incorporating the negative stiffness of topological insulators and analyze its dynamics using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.

Result: Topological insulators show negative surface stiffness, amplifying small interface fluctuations and leading to chaotic behavior, modeled by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.

Conclusion: The study reveals that topological insulators exhibit intrinsic interfacial instability driven by their electronic properties, leading to chaotic interface growth, distinct from conventional instabilities.

Abstract: We demonstrate that topological insulators exhibit an intrinsic interfacial instability that amplifies small interface fluctuations, resulting in chaotic behavior during interface growth. This mechanism is fundamentally different from conventional interfacial instabilities in crystal growth that are driven by external non-uniformities such as surface diffusion, and instead arises from intrinsic electronic properties of topological materials. We find that the boundary states of topological insulators have a pronounced impact on the surface stiffness, which quantifies how strongly a surface resists changes in its shape or orientation. While trivial insulators possess positive stiffness that smooths out surface roughness, topological insulators exhibit negative stiffness that amplifies small shape fluctuations. We derive an effective equation of the interface growth with this negative stiffness and demonstrate that the interface dynamics is governed by the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, a prototypical nonlinear equation exhibiting spatiotemporal chaos.

Motivation: To investigate the proximity-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) in graphene on a trigonal CrSBr monolayer.

Method: Density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function calculations.

Result: The CrSBr substrate induces spin polarization and a sizable exchange splitting in graphene, generating a self-SOT on Dirac electrons. A purely odd SOT component arises, while the even contribution vanishes, with a strong angular dependence. Monte Carlo simulations predict a Curie temperature of approximately 304 K.

Conclusion: The study identifies graphene/CrSBr heterostructures as a promising platform for room-temperature two-dimensional spintronics.

Abstract: We present a first-principles and quantum transport study of proximity-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) in graphene on a trigonal CrSBr monolayer. Density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function calculations shows that the CrSBr substrate induces spin polarization and a sizable exchange splitting in the graphene Dirac states. The resulting current-driven spin density in graphene generates a self-SOT on the Dirac electrons. The proximity-induced exchange field breaks time-reversal symmetry and gives rise to a purely odd SOT component, while the even contribution vanishes. The torque magnitude exhibits a strong angular dependence with phase shifts arising from the noncollinearity between the CrSBr magnetization and the induced magnetic moments in graphene. Monte Carlo simulations based on the calculated exchange parameters predict a Curie temperature of approximately 304 K, confirming the robustness of ferromagnetism in the trigonal CrSBr monolayer. These results identify graphene/CrSBr heterostructures as a promising platform for room-temperature two-dimensional spintronics.

Abstract: Multi-terminal topological devices are a new generation of electronic devices with quantized properties robust against imperfections. In magnetic topological insulators, dissipationless edge states give functional devices in zero magnetic field, of interest for quantum metrology (resistance standard) or topological electronics (Chern networks). Here we show that a new generation of simple quantum circuits (disk, ring) with non-Hermitian topology, based on the interconnection of 1D Chern states in the quantum anomalous Hall regime, can have a much stronger quantization of their invariant than that of the Chern invariant itself, when measured in a non-metrology grade setup - that is, in industry-relevant conditions. Remarkably, the chirality-related topological skin effect is realized without the need of a magnetic field or an electrical gate, with a record degree of localization for a quantum Hall device. This new type of topological quantum devices based on magnets, with an exponential response that can be switched at small magnetic fields (about 200mT), can operate at liquid-Helium temperature with a good quantization and have some potential as cryogenic sensors for applications in high-precision impedance or magnetic field measurements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate a ferroelectric instability of a magnon Bose-Einstein condensate, mediated by its interaction with an electric field through a geometric Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase. A distinct feature of the system is the positive feedback loop in which an electric field induces magnon orbital motion via the AC phase, generating electric polarization that in turn enhances the original field. Based on bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field theory, we show that this feedback drives a spontaneous ferroelectric transition in the magnon superfluid, accompanied by a persistent magnon supercurrent. In the resulting ferroelectric phase, the quasiparticle excitation spectrum becomes nonreciprocal, reflecting spontaneous breaking of spatial inversion symmetry. At the critical point of the transition, the bosonic BdG Hamiltonian exhibits coalescence of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors, forming an exceptional point. The corresponding eigenvector is an equally weighted superposition of bosonic quasiparticle and quasihole states and is invariant under particle-hole transformation, allowing it to be interpreted as a bosonic analog of a Majorana fermion.

Abstract: A periodically driven Fermi gas coupled to a simple boson bath reaches a non-equilibrium steady-state occupation with sharp non-analyticities at certain momenta. Here, we demonstrate that these non-analyticities behave as emergent Fermi surfaces by showing that they give rise to quantum oscillations of observables with a period controlled by the effective Fermi surface area enclosed by these non-analyticities. However, these oscillations have several striking differences with standard equilibrium quantum oscillations. For example, they remain non-analytic at finite temperatures, their amplitude can survive up to extremely high temperatures comparable to the frequency of the drive, and they can display non-monotonic temperature dependence completely at odds with standard Lifshits-Kosevich behavior.

Abstract: We investigate quantum tunneling of charge carriers through a periodic superlattice in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with rectangular potential barriers, including the presence of a defect, using a low-energy continuum model. Transmission probabilities are numerically analyzed depending on the parameters of the problem, highlighting the roles of twist angle, number of barriers, barrier geometry, and the presence of a defect barrier within the superlattice. Our numerical results reveal that transmission is highly sensitive to these parameters: reducing the twist angle changes the number, depth, and position of transmission gaps and resonance peaks. The presence of defect affects the transmission, leading to the appearance of tunneling states inside transmission gaps with energy position can be tuned by the well width. At low incident energy, the transmission for normally incident electrons is perfect or nearly perfect, independent of the twist angle and the number of barriers. However, at large incident energy, the transmission becomes distinctly anisotropic, reflecting the separation of Dirac cones induced by twist angle variations. The presence of defects, particularly at smaller twist angles, provides additional control of tunneling behavior, allowing complete suppression of Klein tunneling under certain conditions. These findings extend the established understanding of miniband transport in periodic graphene systems and open new possibilities for twist-tunable nanoelectronic and quantum devices.

TL;DR: Cohomology of momentum-space crystallographic groups classifies crystalline topological insulators and twistings, offering algebraic invariants distinct from differential forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of real-space crystallographic groups in characterizing projective symmetries and to develop a cohomological framework for crystalline topological phases.

Method: The study utilizes the cohomology of MCGs, specifically second and third cohomology groups, to encode and classify topological band structures and twistings.

Result: The second cohomology groups classify Abelian crystalline topological insulators, while the third cohomology groups classify point-group actions on the Brillouin torus, providing algebraic invariants for topological phases.

Conclusion: The cohomological theory of momentum-space crystallographic groups (MCGs) provides a comprehensive algebraic framework for classifying crystalline topological insulators and point-group action twistings, differing fundamentally from conventional differential forms.

Abstract: Crystallographic groups are conventionally studied in real space to characterize crystal symmetries. Recent work has recognized that when these symmetries are realized projectively, momentum space inherently accommodates nonsymmorphic symmetries, thereby evoking the concept of \textit{momentum-space crystallographic groups} (MCGs). Here, we reveal that the cohomology of MCGs encodes fundamental data of crystalline topological band structures. Specifically, the collection of second cohomology groups, $H^2(Γ_F,\mathbb{Z})$, for all MCGs $Γ_F$, provides an exhaustive classification of Abelian crystalline topological insulators, serving as an effective approximation to the full crystalline topological classification. Meanwhile, the third cohomology groups $H^3(Γ_F,\mathbb{Z})$ across all MCGs exhaustively classify all possible twistings of point-group actions on the Brillouin torus, essential data for twisted equivariant K-theory. Furthermore, we establish the isomorphism $H^{n+1}(Γ_F,\mathbb{Z})\cong H^n\big(Γ_F,\operatorname{\mathcal{F}}(\mathbb{R}^d_F,U(1))\big)$ for $ n\ge 1$, where $\operatorname{\mathcal{F}}(\mathbb{R}^d_F,U(1))$ denotes the space of continuous $U(1)$-valued functions on the $d$D momentum space $\mathbb{R}^d_F$. The case $n=1$ yields a complete set of topological invariants formulated in purely algebraic terms, which differs fundamentally from the conventional formulation in terms of differential forms. The case $n=2$, analogously, provides a fully algebraic description for all such twistings. Thus, the cohomological theory of MCGs serves as a key technical framework for analyzing crystalline topological phases within the general setting of projective symmetry.

Abstract: Absorption of an isolated bulk magnetic skyrmion into an empty domain wall in a chiral ferromagnetic system is studied using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with and without the demagnetization effect taken into account. The full phase diagram of creation versus repulsion or annihilation is mapped out in case of both Bloch-type and Néel-type DMI, with and without demagnetization. Finally, the unstable domain wall, realizable with a setup of several external magnets, contains the theoretical possibility of producing a 1-dimensional version of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which in turn can create a number of skyrmion-anti-skyrmion pairs engulfed in the domain wall: We denote them domain-wall-skyrmion-anti-domain-wall-skyrmion pairs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Finite coherent quantum systems exhibit a nontrivial response to local sources of phase curvature, which cannot be reduced to conventional forces, disorder-induced localization, or simple gap opening. Here we show that, in finite fermionic rings, a localized symmetry-breaking perturbation acts as a source of phase curvature in the many-body Hilbert space, inducing an anomalous breakdown of global phase rigidity. Starting from a Hubbard-Peierls description, we derive an effective field-theoretic functional in which the inverse local susceptibility defines a phase-rigidity scale controlled by system size and electronic correlations. This rigidity quantifies the resistance of a coherent many-body state to geometric deformation of its phase structure, rather than to energetic localization. We demonstrate that interactions enhance phase rigidity in finite systems, counter to naive expectations based on single-particle localization, and that rigidity loss may occur without a direct correspondence to gap formation. Molecular pi-electron rings and mesoscopic quantum circuits provide experimentally accessible realizations of this regime, establishing a direct connection between local phase curvature, geometric rigidity, and coherence-driven phenomena across finite quantum matter.

Abstract: The impact of projective lattice symmetry on electronic band structures has attracted significant attention in recent years, particularly in light of growing experimental studies of two-dimensional hexagonal materials in magnetic fields. Yet, most theoretical work to date has focused on the square lattice due to its relative simplicity. In this work, we investigate the role of projective lattice symmetry in a hexagonal lattice with rational magnetic flux, emphasizing the resulting topological constraints on the electronic band structure. We show that, at pi flux, the symmetry in the hexagonal lattice enforces novel Dirac band touchings at E not equal to zero, and for general rational flux it constrains the number of Dirac points at E = 0. We further analyze the symmetry-imposed constraints on the Chern numbers of both isolated gapped bands and band multiplets connected by Dirac-point touchings. Our results demonstrate that these constraints in the hexagonal lattice differ substantially from those in the square lattice.

Motivation: To address challenges in THz technology related to detector sensitivity, noise, and cryogenic operation.

Method: Numerical simulations and photoresponse measurements were used to study the influence of a metal reflective layer on the photothermoelectric behavior of the device.

Result: The device's responsivity increased by approximately 30-fold, with a response time below 130 μs, and demonstrated the ability to distinguish concealed liquids.

Conclusion: The integration of interferometric enhancement of absorption with a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity-based photodetector significantly improves THz absorption and responsivity, demonstrating potential for advanced terahertz imaging technology.

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) technology shows great potential in 6G communications and imaging, but faces challenges related to detector sensitivity, noise, and cryogenic operation. Here, we integrate interferometric enhancement of absorption (IEA) from a metal reflection layer with a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC)-based photodetector. The hybrid configuration enhances the in-plane electric field and improves the plasmon-induced thermal gradient. Numerical simulations and photoresponse measurements were employed to systematically investigate the influence of a metal reflective layer on the photothermoelectric behavior of the device, which reveals the IEA design significantly boosts the THz absorption rate in graphene nanostructures and promotes asymmetry in the lateral diffusion of hot carriers. Compared with the bare device, the responsivity of the device is enhanced by approximately 30-folds, while maintaining a response time below 130 μs. We further demonstrate the potential of the device to distinguish concealed liquids, advancing high-responsivity, room-temperature, and compact terahertz imaging technology.

Abstract: Superconducting diodes promise dissipation-less rectification, yet intrinsic platforms invariably have very low efficiencies. We reveal a fundamental thermodynamic origin of this behavior that is independent of microscopic details. Denoting $ε= I_c^-/I_c^+$, where $I_c^\pm$ are critical current magnitudes in opposite directions with $I_c^+>I_c^-$ by convention, we show that $ε=0$ is impossible without fine-tuning, while $ε\to0$ can occur but only upon tuning to a critical point \emph{within} the superconducting state. Away from such internal instabilities, using general Landau theory, we derive a lower bound on $ε$ that limits intrinsic diode performance. We illustrate these ideas in a minimal superconductor-Ising model, where the strong nonreciprocity can be seen explicitly. In particular, if the internal transition is continuous, we show that the scaling of $ε$ near the transition is locked to known critical exponents.

TL;DR: Conditions for charge and spin Josephson diode effects in spin-polarized magnetic materials are identified, requiring noncoplanarity, spin band contributions, and higher harmonics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the conditions under which charge and spin Josephson diode effects appear in spin-polarized magnetic materials between spin-singlet superconductors.

Method: The paper presents a theoretical analysis using quantum geometric phases and Josephson current-phase relations, supported by a minimal phenomenological model.

Result: Noncoplanarity of the spin texture, contribution from both spin bands, and higher harmonics in the current-phase relation are necessary for the effects to manifest.

Conclusion: The study identifies a minimal phenomenological model that captures the necessary conditions for charge and spin Josephson diode effects in strongly spin-polarized inhomogeneous magnetic materials.

Abstract: We present a set of necessary conditions for the appearance of charge and spin Josephson diode effects across strongly spin-polarized inhomogeneous magnetic materials (FM) placed between two spin-singlet superconductors. Noncoplanarity of the FM's spin texture gives rise to quantum geometric phases, $Δ\varphi'$, that enter the Josephson current-phase relation (CPR) similarly to the superconducting phase difference, resulting in charge and spin Josephson diode effects. Our study shows that such effects appear if the CPR possesses no phase-inversion center, achieved under the following conditions. First, noncoplanarity of the spin texture is necessary to break the spatial inversion symmetry. Second, both spin bands have to contribute to the transport, i.e., the effect is absent in half-metallic junctions. Third, different band-specific densities of states are required, and this condition is ensured by the strong spin polarization of the FM. Finally, higher harmonics in the CPR are necessary, i.e., the effect is absent in the tunneling limit. However, even in this case, the CPR must not have a phase-inversion center, which is ensured by the restriction of the quantum geometric phase to values $Δ\varphi'\neq kπ/2, k\in\mathbb{Z}$. We formulate a minimal phenomenological model that incorporates all these points, qualitatively illustrating our theory.

Abstract: The triangular Hofstadter-Hubbard model, realizable in moiré bilayers, provides a fertile ground for discovering correlated topological states. We investigate this model in the grand canonical ensemble by introducing a fermionic infinite projected entangled simplex state (iPESS) approach, which offers direct access to the stability of the emergent correlated states at the thermodynamic limit. Through numerically optimizing fermionic iPESS, we accurately capture the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase in the Mott insulating regime, characterized by a uniform chiral order, entanglement spectrum and the appearance of gossamer correlation tails in spin channel. The intermediate-$U$ CSL is separated from the weak-$U$ Chern insulator by a Mott transition at $U_{c_1} \approx 11.5$, signaled by changes in the charge fluctuation and compressibility. Finite-correlation-length scaling of the magnetization reveals a transition into a large-$U$ $120^\circ$ Néel phase at $U_{c_2} \approx 22.5$. Remarkably, with finite hole doping $δ$, we identify a uniform superconducting state with a finite pairing amplitude, whose order parameter displays a nearly universal phase winding across the $U$-$δ$ phase diagram. Our work demonstrates robust chiral superconductivity in the thermodynamic limit through doping Chern insulator and CSL.

Motivation: To explore the effects of quantum fluctuations and chiral spin correlations on electrical transport, particularly in revealing a $	ext{log}(T)$ temperature dependence in the electrical magnetochiral effect.

Method: The Green's function method and a scattering theory approach were employed to analyze the scattering process similar to the Kondo effect.

Result: The electrical magnetochiral effect shows a $	ext{log}(T)$ temperature dependence, and it is sensitive to the sign of vector spin chirality and the magnetic field.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that local spin correlations and quantum fluctuations can cooperatively induce nontrivial properties in transport phenomena, as evidenced by the $	ext{log}(T)$ temperature dependence in the electrical magnetochiral effect.

Abstract: Chiral magnetic states give rise to rich phenomena, from the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear electrical current to multiferroics and magnetochiral dichroism. Most of the studies on electrical transport so far have focused on the cases where the magnetic moments are well approximated by classical local moments. Here, we reveal that the coexistence of quantum fluctuations and chiral spin correlations gives rise to a $\log(T)$ temperature dependence in the electrical magnetochiral effect, a nonreciprocal response. Using the Green's function method and a scattering theory approach, we show that the $\log(T)$ temperature dependence occurs through a scattering process similar to that of the Kondo effect. The electrical magnetochiral effect is sensitive to the sign of vector spin chirality and the magnetic field. The results demonstrate that local spin correlations and quantum fluctuations cooperatively induce nontrivial properties in transport phenomena.

Abstract: In this review, we first present compelling evidence from resonant inelastic x-ray scattering data that highlights the significance of the long-range Coulomb interaction in cuprate charge dynamics, particularly around the in-plane momentum q=(0,0). We show that these experimental observations are well-captured by the layered t-J-V model, which extends the standard t-J framework to include the long-range Coulomb interaction V and the layered structure.
  This new perspective elucidates how charge dynamics renormalizes one-particle excitation properties, leading to several profound and often counterintuitive consequences. We demonstrate that the electron dispersion does not exhibit a sharp kink, and Landau quasiparticles persist in the low-energy limit despite a significant suppression of their spectral weight. We further show that while charge fluctuations alone cannot fully account for the pseudogap, they are a crucial component for understanding its formation. Additionally, we reveal that optical plasmon excitations generate fermionic quasiparticles, known as plasmarons, which give rise to a distinct, incoherent replica band.
  We argue that accurately describing these plasmonic effects requires a three-dimensional theoretical approach. This perspective on plasmon excitations may offer a critically new clue to a long-standing puzzle: why multi-layer cuprate superconductors, containing more than two CuO2 layers per unit cell, consistently exhibit a higher critical temperature Tc than their single-layer counterparts. Finally, we review the spin-fluctuation mechanism of superconductivity suffers from the "self-restraint effect" and show how important the screened Coulomb interaction is in the spin-fluctuation mechanism to realize high-Tc superconductivity.

TL;DR: Optical control of interlayer CDW stacking induces a nonvolatile Mott-to-metallic transition in 1T-TaSe2, offering new possibilities for tailored electronic phases and devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nonvolatile control of the Mott transition is a significant goal in correlated-electron physics, enabling access to emergent states and technological applications. Ultrafast optical excitation offers a precise method to manipulate non-equilibrium phases.

Method: The researchers used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to observe a nonvolatile Mott-to-metallic transition in the ultrafast laser-excited charge density wave material 1T-TaSe2. Complementary theoretical calculations were employed to analyze the transition mechanism.

Result: A highly robust and reversible optical control of the Mott state was achieved, with the transition originating from a rearrangement of the interlayer CDW stacking, reducing the Mott state and stabilizing a metallic phase.

Conclusion: The study establishes optical control of interlayer stacking as a versatile strategy for inducing nonvolatile phase transitions in Mott systems, offering a new route to tailor correlated electronic phases and enable reconfigurable high-frequency devices.

Abstract: Nonvolatile control of the Mott transition is a central goal in correlated-electron physics, offering access to fascinating emergent states and great potential for technological applications. Compared to chemical or mechanical approaches, ultrafast optical excitation further promises a path to create and manipulate novel non-equilibrium phases with ultimate spatiotemporal precision. However, achieving a truly nonvolatile electronic phase transition in laser-excited Mott systems remains an elusive challenge. Here, we present a highly robust and reversible method for optical control of the Mott state in van der Waals systems. Specifically, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe a nonvolatile Mott-to-metallic transition in the ultrafast laser-excited charge density wave (CDW) material 1T-TaSe2. Complementary theoretical calculations reveal that this transition originates from a rearrangement of the interlayer CDW stacking. This new stacking order, formed following the ultrafast quenching of the CDW, circumvents the need for large-scale atomic sliding. Intriguingly, it introduces a significant in-plane component to the electron hopping and effectively reduces the ratio of on-site Coulomb interaction to bandwidth, thereby suppressing the Mott state and stabilizing a metallic phase. Our results establish optical-control of interlayer stacking as a versatile strategy for inducing nonvolatile phase transitions, opening a new route to tailor correlated electronic phases and realize reconfigurable high-frequency devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the rich collective behavior of doped charges in high-temperature cuprate superconductors and understand the interplay of strong electronic correlations, layered crystal structure, and long-range Coulomb interaction.

Method: Quantitative analyses of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra using the t-J-V model, alongside resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) and RIXS.

Result: Acousticlike plasmons and d-wave bond-charge order are identified in cuprates, with a dual structure in charge dynamics. However, existing frameworks fail to fully explain observations in hole-doped systems.

Conclusion: A universal behavior of doped carriers in cuprates is proposed to reconcile diverse experimental findings, despite unresolved aspects like charge-stripe order in La-based cuprates.

Abstract: We review recent theoretical progress on the charge dynamics of doped carriers in high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Advances in this field have clarified that doped charges in cuprates exhibit remarkably rich collective behavior, governed by the combined effects of strong electronic correlations, the intrinsic layered crystal structure, and long-range Coulomb interaction. First, the emergence of acousticlike plasmons has been firmly established through quantitative analyses of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra based on the t-J-V model -- an extension of the conventional t-J model that incorporates the layered crystal structure and the long-range Coulomb interaction V. These acousticlike plasmons arise near the in-plane momentum q=(0,0) and possess characteristic energies far below the well-known ~ 1 eV optical plasmon. This behavior is found to be universal across both hole- and electron-doped cuprates, including multilayer systems. Second, in electron-doped cuprates, a pronounced tendency toward d-wave bond-charge order develops near q=(0.5pi, 0), as revealed by resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) and RIXS. As a result, the charge dynamics acquires a dual structure, in which low-energy bond-charge excitations coexist with relatively high-energy plasmons. Third, analogous signatures of charge-order tendency have also been reported in hole-doped cuprates. However, a direct application of the d-wave bond-charge-order framework fails to account for experimental observations. Similarly, the charge-stripe order in La-based cuprates remains unresolved within existing theoretical approaches. Assuming that mobile carriers behave in a largely universal manner across electron- and hole-doped systems, we discuss a possible scenario that may reconcile these diverse experimental findings.

Abstract: Simulations of quantum matter rely mainly on Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT), which often fails for strongly correlated systems. Quantum embedding (QE) theories address this limitation by mapping the system onto an auxiliary embedding Hamiltonian (EH) describing fragment-environment interactions, but the EH is typically large and its iterative solution is the primary computational bottleneck. We introduce a linear foundation model for QE that utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) to compress the space of quantum states needed to solve the EH within a small variational subspace. Using a data-driven active-learning scheme, we learn this subspace from EH ground states and reduce each embedding solve to a deterministic ground-state eigenvalue problem in the reduced space. Within the ghost Gutzwiller approximation (ghost-GA), we show for a three-orbital Hubbard model that a variational space learned on a Bethe lattice is transferable to square and cubic lattices without additional training, while substantially reducing the cost of the EH step. We further validate the approach on plutonium, where a single variational space reproduces the energetics of all six crystalline phases while reducing the cost of the EH solution by orders of magnitude. This provides a practical route to overcome the main computational bottleneck of QE frameworks, paving the way for high-throughput ab initio simulations of strongly correlated materials at a near-DFT cost.

Abstract: We formulate a time-dependent Fluctuating Local Field (TD-FLF) method for correlated fermion dynamics, extending the stationary FLF approach. The wavefunction is approximated as an ensemble of non-interacting states subject to a classical fluctuating field, with dynamics encoded in the field's time-dependent distribution. This reduces the time-dependent Schrödinger equation to a generalized eigenvalue problem in a significantly reduced basis. Applied to half-filled 2D Hubbard lattices, TD-FLF yields highly accurate results, outperforming mean-field theory and capturing oscillation frequencies and amplitudes in good agreement with exact diagonalization. Its low computational cost and flexibility make TD-FLF a promising tool for simulating driven correlated systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the phase diagram and properties of a one-dimensional spin quantum breakdown model with exponential U(1) symmetry, focusing on spontaneous symmetry breaking and emergent phases.

Method: Exact diagonalization (ED) and analysis in the large S limit on an exactly solvable Rokhsar-Kivelson line.

Result: Discovery of a quantum breakdown condensate phase with exponential U(1) spontaneous symmetry breaking, bulk gap violation, left-edge mode, finite entropy density, and random order parameter distribution.

Conclusion: The quantum breakdown condensate represents a novel phase of matter beyond existing classifications, characterized by disorder-free quantum glass behavior, non-decaying local autocorrelations, and a first-order spontaneous symmetry breaking phase transition.

Abstract: We study the phase diagram of a one-dimensional spin quantum breakdown model, which has an exponential $U(1)$ symmetry with charge unit decaying as $2^{-j}$ with site position $j$. By exact diagonalization (ED), we show that the model with spin $S\ge2$ exhibits an exponential $U(1)$ spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase dubbed a quantum breakdown condensate. It exhibits a bulk gap violating the Goldstone theorem, and an edge mode only on the left edge if in open boundary condition. In a length $L$ lattice, the condensate has $\mathcal{O}(2^L)$ number of SSB ground states originating from the $\mathcal{O}(2^L)$ number of exponential $U(1)$ charge sectors, leading to a finite entropy density $\ln 2$. This enforces a first order SSB phase transition into this phase, as observed in ED and verified in the large $S$ limit on an exactly solvable Rokhsar-Kivelson line. The condensate has an SSB order parameter being the local in-plane spin, which points in angles related by the chaotic Bernoulli (dyadic) map and thus is effectively random. Moreover, we show the condensate exhibits non-decaying local autocorrelations, and does not have an off-diagonal long-range order. The quantum breakdown condensate thus behaves as a disorder-free quantum glass and is beyond the existing classifications of phases of matter.

Motivation: To understand the role of complex anisotropic exchange interactions in topological magnon behavior.

Method: Investigates the effects of multiple anisotropic exchange interactions on topological magnons in a honeycomb ferromagnet.

Result: Discovery of a novel topological phase transition with chiral inversion and magnon valley degree of freedom, impacting the thermal Hall conductivity.

Conclusion: The study reveals a chirality-selective topological magnon phase transition driven by the interplay of DMI and PDI, with potential applications in magnon devices and topological magnonics.

Abstract: A variety of distinct anisotropic exchange interactions commonly exist in one magnetic material due to complex crystal, magnetic and orbital symmetries. Here we investigate the effects of multiple anisotropic exchange interactions on topological magnon in a honeycomb ferromagnet, and find a chirality-selective topological magnon phase transition induced by a complicated interplay of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI), accompanied by the bulk gap close and reopen with chiral inversion. Moreover, this novel topological phase transition involves band inversion at high symmetry points $K$ and $K'$, which can be regarded as a pseudo-orbital reversal, i.e. magnon valley degree of freedom, implying a new manipulation corresponding to a sign change of the magnon thermal Hall conductivity. Indeed, it can be realized in 4$d$ or 5$d$ correlated materials with both spin-orbit coupling and orbital localized states, such as iridates and ruthenates, etc. This novel regulation may have potential applications on magnon devices and topological magnonics.

Motivation: To explore how small perturbations can shift the balance between competing electronic phases in metal-insulator transition materials, and to investigate the potential for engineering novel electronic and magnetic functionalities.

Method: Local low-dose focused ion beam irradiation was applied to La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 to increase resistivity and convert the ferromagnetic-metal state to a paramagnetic-insulator. Electric stimuli were then used to induce a non-thermal insulator-to-metal transition.

Result: The irradiated material exhibited a voltage-induced metallic phase that was ferromagnetic, with clear anisotropic magnetoresistance, enabling low-power, repeatable volatile resistive switching.

Conclusion: The study reports the discovery of a unique material where electrical triggering induces a metallic phase with ferromagnetism, contrasting the common suppression of magnetic order in similar materials. This opens new opportunities for applications in spintronics and neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: In metal-insulator transition materials, a small perturbation can shift the delicate balance between competing or coexisting electronic phases, leading to dramatic changes of the material's properties. Using La0.7Sr0.3MnO3, a prototypical metal-insulator transition manganite, we show that local low-dose focused ion beam irradiation increases resistivity by several orders of magnitude, converting the ferromagnetic-metal ground state into a paramagnetic-insulator. Surprisingly, we found that applying electric stimuli to the irradiated material induces a non-thermal insulator-to-metal transition, which results in low-power, repeatable volatile resistive switching. Magnetotransport measurements revealed that this voltage-induced metallic phase in the irradiated material is ferromagnetic, exhibiting clear anisotropic magnetoresistance. This work, thus, reports the discovery of a unique material in which the electrical triggering of the electronic phase transition results in the onset of magnetism, in stark contrast to the magnetic order suppression commonly observed in other metal-insulator transition switching materials. We demonstrate that local focused ion beam irradiation provides new and exciting opportunities to engineer electronic and magnetic functionalities that can find practical applications ranging from spintronics to neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: The heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh2As2 exhibits a non-superconducting phase transition that precedes the emergence of superconductivity. The nature of the corresponding order parameter remains under debate, with competing proposals involving magnetic dipoles or electric quadrupoles. We derive the momentum-dependent multipolar susceptibilities and effective interactions among the localized 4f electrons, based on the framework of density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory. Magnetic fluctuations within the crystalline-electric-field (CEF) ground-state doublet are dominated by q=(1/2,1/2,0), corresponding to a two-dimensional checkerboard configuration of the magnetic moment M_z along the c axis. Hybridization between the CEF ground state and the first-excited doublet gives rise to leading magnetic octupole fluctuations of z(x^2-y^2) symmetry, followed by electric quadrupole fluctuations of x^2-y^2 and {yz, zx} symmetries. By taking into account the anisotropic magnetic-field dependence of the transition temperature T_0, we conclude that an antiferromagnetic order of M_z at q=(1/2,1/2,0) is consistent with the experiments, owing to the enhancement of T_0 caused by fluctuations of the field-induced quadrupole of {yz, zx} type under an in-plane magnetic field.

Motivation: The study aims to explore and demonstrate non-reciprocal XCD in systems where such behavior is generally forbidden due to preserved symmetries.

Method: The researchers used resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to identify circularly polarized phonons in ferro-rotational MnTiO₃.

Result: The researchers identified ferro-rotational phonons in MnTiO₃, which directly demonstrate non-reciprocal XCD, and proposed that these phonons underlie the ferro-rotational order.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates non-reciprocal XCD in a system with preserved inversion and time-reversal symmetries, attributing it to the interplay between photon helicity, phonon polarization, and axial ferro-rotational order.

Abstract: X-ray circular dichroism (XCD), defined as the difference in absorption or scattering intensity between X-rays of opposite polarizations, arises from the breaking of spatial inversion or time-reversal symmetry and is thus sensitive to chirality, magnetism, and their interplay. Non-reciprocal XCD, in which the dichroic response changes upon reversing the propagation direction of the probe, is generally forbidden in systems with both symmetries. Using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, we identify circularly polarized phonons in ferro-rotational MnTiO$_3$, which we term ferro-rotational phonons. Their excitations provide a direct demonstration of non-reciprocal XCD in a system that globally preserves inversion and time-reversal symmetries. We propose that a condensate of these phonons, manifested as standing waves, underlies the ferro-rotational order in MnTiO$_3$. The interplay among photon helicity, phonon polarization, and the axial ferro-rotational order gives rise to the observed non-reciprocal circular dichroism.

Abstract: Nonlinear elements in a rectifying circuit can be used to harvest energy from thermal fluctuations either steadily or transitorily. We study an energy harvesting system comprising a small variable capacitor (e.g., free standing graphene) wired to two diodes and two storage capacitors that may be kept at different temperatures (or at a single one) and use two current loops. The system reaches very rapidly a quasi stationary state with constant overall charge while the difference of the charges at the storage capacitors evolves much more slowly to its stationary value. In this paper, we extract an exponentially small factor out of the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation and use a Chapman-Enskog procedure to describe the long evolution of the marginal probability density for the charge difference, from the quasi stationary state to the final stationary state (thermal equilibrium for equal temperatures). The second paper of this series shows that the results of the perturbation procedure compare well with direct numerical simulations. For a specific form of the diodes' nonlinear mobilities, we can approximate the quasi stationary state by Gaussian functions and further study the evolution of the marginal probability density. The latter adopts the shape of a slowly expanding pulse (comprising left and right moving wave fronts whose fore edges become sharper as time elapses) in the space of charge differences that leaves the final stationary state behind it.

Motivation: To investigate the thermal energy harvesting potential of electronic circuits and understand the role of diodes in charge accumulation compared to resistors.

Method: Numerically solving the time-dependent and time-independent Fokker-Planck equations to analyze the thermal energy harvesting capability of two electronic circuits with diodes and resistors.

Result: The first circuit shows capacitor charge and discharge behavior dependent on temperature, capacitance, and diode quality. The second circuit achieves non-zero steady-state charge accumulation when diodes are at different temperatures, with opposite signs on capacitors. Resistors fail to produce such effects.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that diodes are essential for thermal energy harvesting in the described circuits, unlike resistors, as they enable transient and steady-state charge accumulation. The numerical analysis of the Fokker-Planck equation supports these findings.

Abstract: This study is presented in a series of two papers. The first paper is an analytical study. This is the second paper, and here we numerically study the thermal energy harvesting capability of two electronic circuits. The first circuit consists of a diode and capacitor in series. We solve the time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation and show the capacitor initially charges and then discharges to zero. The peak charge on the capacitor increases with temperature, capacitance, and diode quality. The second circuit has two current loops with one small capacitor, two storage capacitors, and two diodes wired in opposition. When the diodes are held at different temperatures we observe a non-zero steady-state charge is accumulated on both storage capacitors. The magnitude of the stored charges are nearly equal but the signs are opposite. When resistors are used in place of diodes there is no transient and no steady-state charge buildup. Numerical studies for the time-independent Fokker-Planck equation are presented and confirm the steady state charges.

We have considered spins $s$ in a bounded interval, where $s \in [-1,+1]$ in square-lattice configuration with periodic boundary condition. We have observed that the critical temperature $T_c$ is approximately $0.925$, showing a clear second order phase transition. Considering finite size scaling, we have also obtained the critical exponents associated with susceptibility, specific heat, magnetization and we find that these values are in good agreement with the corresponding values obtained for the standard $2d$ Ising universality class.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the understudied topic of 'memory of disorder' in frustrated artificial materials, particularly focusing on non-trivial, sequence-dependent responses.

Method: Both analytical and numerical approaches were used to study the sequence-dependent responses of two artificial spin ices: the Landau-ordered square spin ice and the disordered Shakti spin ice.

Result: Shakti spin ice exhibits pronounced sequence-dependent responses, including deterministic and stochastic memory forms, while the square lattice lacks path dependence. Cyclic driving enhances memory retention in Shakti.

Conclusion: The study highlights how topological constraints and correlated disorder generate robust memory effects in frustrated artificial materials, previously examined mainly for their ground-state kinetics and thermodynamics. This opens new research directions in the study of memory in disordered systems.

Abstract: Complex behaviors often sit at a critical threshold between order and disorder. But not all disorder is created equal. Disorder can be trivial or constrained, and correlated disorder can even be topological. Crucially, constrained disorder can harbor memory, leading to non-trivial, sequence-dependent responses to external manipulations. And yet the fascinating subject of "memory of disorder" remains poorly explored, as memory is often associated to the retention of metastable order. In recent years artificial frustrated materials -- in particular arrays of frustrated nanomagnets known as artificial spin ices -- have been employed to study complex disorders and its wealth of exotic behaviors, yet their memory properties have received much less attention. Here, we investigate both analytically and numerically the sequence-dependent responses of two somehow opposite yet related artificial spin ices: the Landau-ordered square spin ice and the disordered but topologically-ordered Shakti spin ice. We find that Shakti exhibits a pronounced sequence-dependent response, whereas in the square lattice, such path dependence is absent. Within Shakti, even the minimal periodic supercell demonstrates both deterministic and stochastic forms of sequence memory, depending on the interaction strength. Extending our study to cyclic driving, we find that retracing the same input path leads to enhanced memory retention. These results open new perspectives on how topological constraints and correlated disorder generate robust memory effects in frustrated artificial materials, hitherto examined mainly in terms of their ground-state kinetics and thermodynamics.

Abstract: Diffusion in rugged free-energy landscapes is central to diverse problems in chemical physics, biomolecular dynamics, polymer transport and numerous disordered systems. Zwanzig's well-known classic mean-field theory predicts that roughness reduces the diffusion coefficient by an exponential factor determined solely by the variance of the disorder. However, the numerical studies of Banerjee, Seki, and Bagchi (BSB) showed that this result fails for uncorrelated Gaussian-distributed site energies because rare but deep three-site traps dominate long-time transport. BSB introduced Gaussian \emph{spatial} correlations - originally developed in astrophysics to model turbulent density fluctuations - and demonstrated that even modest correlations suppress these pathological traps and restore Zwanzig's exponential scaling. Here we present here a unified theoretical framework clarifying (i) why Zwanzig's local averaging, may be viewed as a Gaussian cumulant expansion, could breakdown. In particular, how its validity is destroyed by uncorrelated disorder, and (ii) how Gaussian spatial correlations reshape roughness increments, eliminate asymmetric multi-site traps, and thereby recover mean-field diffusion, and (iii) a derivation showing exactly how Gaussian spatial correlations modify roughness increments, trap statistics, and ultimately the diffusion constant. We also provide explicit numerical triplet examples illustrating the dramatic reduction of escape times produced by spatial correlations.

Abstract: In the approaches based on matrix-product states (MPSs), such as the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, the ordering of the sites crucially affects the computational accuracy. We investigate the performance of an algorithm that searches for the optimal site order by iterative local site rearrangement. We improve the algorithm by expanding the range of site rearrangement and apply it to a one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg model with random site permutation. The results indicate that increasing the range of the site rearrangement significantly improves the computational accuracy of the DMRG method. In particular, increasing the rearrangement range from two to three sites reduces the average relative error in the ground-state energy by 65% to 94% in the cases we tested. We also discuss the computational cost of the algorithm and its application as a preprocessing for MPS-based calculations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitations of hardware-native interactions, which are typically restricted to one- and two-body terms, to explore complex quantum many-body physics.

Method: A hybrid digital-analog protocol that embeds analog evolution between shallow entangling-gate layers to produce effective Hamiltonians with three- and four-body interactions.

Result: Experimental demonstration of a topological spin chain with prethermal strong zero modes and models with three- and four-body interactions on a trapped-ion quantum processor.

Conclusion: The hybrid digital-analog protocol successfully generates effective Hamiltonians with non-commuting multi-body interactions, enabling the study of complex quantum systems on near-term hardware.

Abstract: While quantum simulators promise to explore quantum many-body physics beyond classical computation, their capabilities are limited by the available native interactions in the hardware. On many platforms, accessible Hamiltonians are largely restricted to one- and two-body interactions, limiting access to multi-body Hamiltonians and to systems governed by simultaneous, non-commuting interaction terms that are central to condensed matter, quantum chemistry, and high-energy physics. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate a hybrid digital-analog protocol that overcomes these limitations by embedding analog evolution between shallow entangling-gate layers. This method produces effective Hamiltonians with simultaneous non-commuting three- and four-body interactions that are generated non-perturbatively and without Trotter error -- capabilities not practically attainable on near-term hardware using purely digital or purely analog schemes. We implement our scheme on a trapped-ion quantum processor and use it to realize a topological spin chain exhibiting prethermal strong zero modes persisting at high temperature, as well as models featuring three- and four-body interactions. Our hardware-agnostic and scalable method opens new routes to realizing complex many-body physics across quantum platforms.

TL;DR: A geometric analysis of spin-1/2 systems reveals entanglement's role in quantum dynamics, offering insights for efficient quantum circuit design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify geometric and dynamical perspectives for spin-1/2 particle systems with all-range Ising interactions, addressing gaps in understanding their state space geometry and its impact on quantum control and entanglement.

Method: The paper employs the Fubini-Study formalism to derive the metric tensor and Riemann curvature of the quantum state manifold. It analyzes geometric and topological phases, evolution speed, and the quantum brachistochrone problem.

Result: The system's state space is a smooth, compact, two-dimensional manifold with spherical topology. Entanglement modulates geometric phases and evolution speed, with a critical threshold beyond which geometric constraints hinder dynamics.

Conclusion: The study provides a geometric framework for understanding spin-1/2 particle systems with Ising interactions, revealing the influence of curvature and topology on quantum dynamics and phases. It highlights entanglement's dual role in enhancing and constraining evolution, offering practical insights for quantum technology design.

Abstract: We present a unified geometric and dynamical framework for a physical system consisting of $n$ spin-$1/2$ particles with all-range Ising interaction. Using the Fubini-Study formalism, we derive the metric tensor of the associated quantum state manifold and compute the corresponding Riemann curvature. Our analysis reveals that the system evolves over a smooth, compact, two-dimensional manifold with spherical topology and a dumbbell-like structure shaped by collective spin interactions. We further investigate the influence of the geometry and topology of the resulting state space on the behavior of geometric and topological phases acquired by the system. We explore how this curvature constrains the system's dynamical behavior, including its evolution speed and Fubini-Study distance between the quantum states. Within this geometric framework, we address the quantum brachistochrone problem and derive the minimal time required for optimal evolution, a result useful for time-efficient quantum circuit design. Subsequently, we explore the role of entanglement in shaping the state space geometry, modulating geometric phase, and controlling evolution speed and brachistochrone time. Our results reveal that entanglement enhances dynamics up to a critical threshold, beyond which geometric constraints begin to hinder evolution. Moreover, entanglement induces critical shifts in the geometric phase, making it a sensitive indicator of entanglement levels and a practical tool for steering quantum evolution. This approach offers valuable guidance for developing quantum technologies that require time-efficient control strategies rooted in the geometry of quantum state space.

TL;DR: Disorder can induce superfluidity in systems with multiple energy levels, demonstrated via qutrit-based experiments revealing novel phases and long-range coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to explore the phases arising from the interplay between disorder, kinetic energy, and interactions, particularly how disorder can induce resonances that enhance mobility in systems with more than two energy levels per site.

Method: Utilizing a superconducting processor with qutrit readout and control, the researchers performed compressibility measurements and spatially-resolved two-point correlator measurements, along with dynamical structure factor analysis.

Result: Results include the identification of an incompressible Mott insulator, compressible phases with glassiness signatures, regions with a non-vanishing condensate fraction, and the observation of a linearly-dispersing phonon mode in the superfluid even under disorder.

Conclusion: The study provides strong experimental evidence for disorder-induced superfluidity, highlighting the unusual emergence of long-range correlations in a disordered landscape through qutrit-based experiments.

Abstract: The emergence of states with long-range correlations in a disordered landscape is rare, as disorder typically suppresses the particle mobility required for long-range coherence. But when more than two energy levels are available per site, disorder can induce resonances that locally enhance mobility. Here we explore phases arising from the interplay between disorder, kinetic energy, and interactions on a superconducting processor with qutrit readout and control. Compressibility measurements distinguish an incompressible Mott insulator from surrounding compressible phases and reveal signatures of glassiness, reflected in non-ergodic behavior. Spatially-resolved two-point correlator measurements identify regions of the phase diagram with a non-vanishing condensate fraction. We also visualize the spectrum by measuring the dynamical structure factor. A linearly-dispersing phonon mode materializes in the superfluid, appearing even when disorder is introduced to the clean Mott insulator. Our results provide strong experimental evidence for disorder-induced superfluidity.

Abstract: The notion of quantum symmetry has recently been extended to include reduced-dimensional transformations and algebraic structures beyond groups. Such generalized symmetries lead to exotic phases of matter and excitations that defy Landau's original paradigm. Here, we develop an algebraic framework for systematically deriving the fusion rules of topological defects in higher-dimensional lattice systems with non-invertible generalized symmetries, and focus on a (2+1)-dimensional quantum Ising plaquette model as a concrete illustration. We show that bond-algebraic automorphisms, when combined with the so-called half-gauging procedure, reveal the structure of the non-invertible duality symmetry operators, which can be explicitly represented as a sequential quantum circuit. The resulting duality defects are constrained by the model's rigid higher symmetries (lower-dimensional subsystem symmetries), leading to restricted mobility. We establish the fusion algebra of these defects. Finally, in constructing the non-invertible duality transformation, we explicitly verify that it acts as a partial isometry on the physical Hilbert space, thereby satisfying a recent generalization of Wigner's theorem applicable to non-invertible symmetries.

Abstract: Electrons bound to shallow donors in ZnSe quantum wells are promising candidates for optically addressable spin qubits and single-photon sources. However, their optical coherence and indistinguishability are often limited by spectral broadening arising from charge fluctuations in the local environment. Here, we report electrical control of single donor qubits in ZnSe quantum wells. The applied field induces a DC Stark shift that tunes the emission energy over a range exceeding 30 times the inhomogeneous linewidth, effectively compensating for emitter-to-emitter variations. Concurrently, the field stabilizes trap occupancy, yielding a twofold reduction in optical linewidth and the suppression of spectral wandering. A statistical model based on trap dynamics qualitatively reproduces these observations and elucidates the mechanism of field-assisted charge noise suppression. Our results identify electrical control as a versatile pathway to significantly improve optical and spin addressability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to embed the classical properties of the NDWT—stability, redundancy, and shift invariance—into quantum computation, demonstrating that these properties can be exploited in the quantum setting.

Method: The paper develops two quantum formulations of the NDWT: one based on the epsilon-decimated interpretation (using quantum registers and controlled circular shifts) and another based on the Hadamard test (using diagonal phase operators).

Result: The results include explicit quantum representations of redundant wavelet coefficients and methods for shift-invariant energy scalograms without explicit coefficient reconstruction.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that quantum NDWTs provide a flexible and physically meaningful foundation for multiscale quantum signal processing, with potential applications in denoising, feature extraction, and spectral scaling.

Abstract: The nondecimated or translation-invariant wavelet transform (NDWT) is a central tool in classical multiscale signal analysis, valued for its stability, redundancy, and shift invariance. This paper develops two complementary quantum formulations of the NDWT that embed these classical properties coherently into quantum computation. The first formulation is based on the epsilon-decimated interpretation of the NDWT and realizes all circularly shifted wavelet transforms simultaneously by promoting the shift index to a quantum register and applying controlled circular shifts followed by a wavelet analysis unitary. The resulting construction yields an explicit, fully unitary quantum representation of redundant wavelet coefficients and supports coherent postprocessing, including quantum shrinkage via ancilla-driven completely positive trace preserving maps. The second formulation is based on the Hadamard test and uses diagonal phase operators to probe scale-shift wavelet structure through interference, providing direct access to shift-invariant energy scalograms and multiscale spectra without explicit coefficient reconstruction. Together, these two approaches demonstrate that redundancy and translation invariance can be exploited rather than avoided in the quantum setting. Applications to denoising, feature extraction, and spectral scaling illustrate how quantum NDWTs provide a flexible and physically meaningful foundation for multiscale quantum signal processing.

Abstract: The growing demand for high-capacity quantum communication and large-scale quantum computing underscores the importance of networking quantum processing units via multiplexed photonic channels. A neutral atom array with multiplexed atom-photon entanglement is a promising platform for its realization. Here, we demonstrate a key multiplexed photonic interface guiding the photons from an atom array to a single-mode waveguide array fabricated on a glass-based photonic integrated circuit. Remarkable 10 channels out of the 32-channel waveguide array with 25 $μ$m pitch couple to photons from 10 sites of the atom array with Rydberg gate-enabled separation. Based on the observed correlation between the atomic states and the polarization of the photon with a visibility of 0.87, we anticipate its applicability to a large-scale multiplexed atom-photon entanglement generation for networking quantum processing units.

Abstract: Quantum repeaters enable the generation of reliable entanglement across long distances despite the underlying channel noise. Nevertheless, realizing quantum repeaters poses a difficult engineering challenge due to various device constraints and design tradeoffs. Herein, we propose and analyze an efficient hybrid quantum repeater design that integrates atom-based quantum processing units, spontaneous parametric down-conversion photon sources, and atomic frequency comb quantum memories. Our design leverages the strong spectro-temporal multiplexing capability of the quantum memory to enable high-rate elementary-link entanglement generation between repeater nodes. Transferring the photonic entanglement into matter-qubit entanglement, together with deterministic quantum operations, further enables reliable long-distance entanglement distribution. We analyze photon-loss channels in the hybrid architecture and propose suitable error-suppression strategies that are natively incorporated into our repeater protocol. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate the advantages of our hybrid design for end-to-end secret key rates in a linear repeater-chain model. With continued advances in relevant hardware technologies, we envision that the proposed hybrid design is well-suited for large-scale quantum networks.

TL;DR: Quantum sensing with spin ensembles shows a trade-off between metrological gain and dissipation, where entanglement is key for short-term performance but not for long-term results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in quantum metrology regarding the impact of dissipation on sensing performance, beyond the traditional Heisenberg limit that ignores dissipative dynamics.

Method: Combining the Lindblad master equation with quantum Fisher information to derive analytical trade-off relations for IMG and dissipation rate in spin ensembles subjected to dephasing and emission processes.

Result: The IMG scales inversely with dissipation strength. Quantum entanglement is crucial for achieving Heisenberg scaling in short times but accelerates dissipative degradation, making non-entangled states viable for long observation times.

Conclusion: The study reveals a trade-off between integrated metrological gain (IMG) and dissipation rate in quantum sensing, showing that entanglement is essential for short-term Heisenberg scaling but may not be necessary for comparable performance over longer observation times.

Abstract: Quantum metrology plays a central role in precision sensing, where quantum enhancement of detection performance is crucial for both fundamental studies and practical applications. In this work, we derive a tight performance bound for magnetic-field sensing with a spin ensemble in the presence of dissipation. The metrological performance is quantified by the integrated metrological gain (IMG), which explicitly incorporates the time evolution of the measurement apparatus. By combining the Lindblad master equation with the quantum Fisher information, we obtain analytically exact trade-off relations between the IMG and the dissipation rate for local dephasing and local emission processes, showing that the gain scales inversely with the dissipation strength. This trade-off complements the Heisenberg limit, which addresses only the scaling with the number of spins and neglects dissipative dynamics. We analyze various initial state preparations and elucidate the role of quantum entanglement in the presence of dissipation. Notably, while entanglement is essential for achieving Heisenberg scaling at short times, it also accelerates dissipative degradation during time evolution. Consequently, for sufficiently long observation times, comparable metrological performance can be achieved even without entanglement.

Abstract: A powerful method for analyzing quantum error-correcting codes is to map them onto classical statistical mechanics models. Such mappings have thus far mostly focused on static codes, possibly subject to repeated syndrome measurements. Recent progress in quantum error correction, however, has prompted new paradigms where codes emerge from stabilizer circuits in spacetime -- a unifying perspective encompassing syndrome extraction circuits of static codes, dynamically generated codes, and logical operations. We show how to construct statistical mechanical models for stabilizer circuits subject to independent Pauli errors, by mapping logical equivalence class probabilities of errors to partition functions using the spacetime subsystem code formalism. We also introduce a modular language of spin diagrams for constructing the spin Hamiltonians, which we describe in detail focusing on independent circuit-level X-Z error channels. With the repetition and toric codes as examples, we use our approach to analytically rank logical error rates and thresholds between code implementations with standard and dynamic syndrome extraction circuits, describe the effect of transversal logical Clifford gates on logical error rates, and perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate maximum likelihood thresholds. Our framework offers a universal prescription to analyze, simulate, and compare the decoding properties of any stabilizer circuit, while revealing the innate connections between dynamical quantum systems and noise-resilient phases of matter.

Motivation: 传统光谱协议在异常点无法正确描述开放量子系统的动力学，因为此时本征基崩溃，响应由不可对角化的Jordan块主导。需要一个新框架来解决这一歧义。

Method: 通过引入基于Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules (DMHM)的几何框架，提出Weight Filtered Spectroscopy (WFS)协议，利用拓扑Weight Filtration替代标量线宽，实现基于Liouvillian的nilpotency rank的衰减通道空间分离。

Result: WFS协议能够量化分子极化激元中的耗散泄漏，并验证非厄米Aharonov-Bohm环的拓扑隔离性，证明了拓扑保护在谱隙闭合时仍作为代数不变性存在。

Conclusion: 拓扑保护作为代数不变性在谱隙闭合时仍存在，WFS协议为研究开放量子系统在异常点附近的行为提供了新的几何框架。

Abstract: Standard spectroscopic protocols model the dynamics of open quantum systems as a superposition of isolated, exponentially decaying eigenmodes. This paradigm fails fundamentally at Exceptional Points, where the eigenbasis collapses and the response becomes dominated by non-diagonalizable Jordan blocks. We resolve this ambiguity by introducing a geometric framework based on \textit{Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules} (DMHM). By replacing the scalar linewidth with a topological \textit{Weight Filtration}, we derive ``Weight Filtered Spectroscopy'' (WFS)--a protocol that spatially separates decay channels based on the nilpotency rank of the Liouvillian. We demonstrate that WFS acts as a dissipative x-ray, quantifying dissipative leakage in molecular polaritons and certifying topological isolation in Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm rings. This establishes that topological protection persists as an algebraic invariant even when the spectral gap is closed.

Abstract: We investigate the statistical physics of quantum error correction in ${\rm U}(1)$ symmetry-enriched topological quantum memories. Starting from a phenomenological error model of charge-conserving noise, we study the optimal decoder assuming the local charges of each anyon can be measured. The error threshold of the optimal decoder corresponds to a continuous phase transition in a disordered two-dimensional integer loop model on the Nishimori line. Using an effective replica field theory analysis and Monte Carlo numerics, we show that the optimal decoding transition exhibits Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality with a modified universal jump in winding number variance. We further generalize the model beyond the Nishimori line, which defines a large class of suboptimal decoders. At low nonzero temperatures and strong disorder, we find numerical evidence of a disorder-dominated loop-glass phase which corresponds to a "confidently incorrect" decoder. The zero-temperature limit defines the minimum-cost flow decoder, which serves as the ${\rm U}(1)$ analog of minimum-weight perfect matching in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological codes. Both the optimal and minimum-cost flow decoders are shown to dramatically outperform the charge-agnostic optimal decoder in symmetry-enriched topological codes.

TL;DR: The paper rules out the possibility of determining LOCC transformation conditions for mixed entangled states based on pure-state ensembles, addressing key open questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the lack of understanding about the transformation conditions for mixed entangled states under LOCC, despite the well-understood conditions for pure entangled states.

Method: The authors analyze the limitations of existing conditions by examining the insufficiency of convex roof entanglement measures and entanglement monotones in guaranteeing LOCC transformations.

Result: The results show that the conditions based on convex roof entanglement measures and entanglement monotones are insufficient to ensure LOCC transformations for mixed states.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the transformation conditions for mixed entangled states under LOCC cannot be determined based solely on the properties of their pure-state ensembles, addressing several open questions in this area.

Abstract: The conditions for transforming pure entangled states under local operations and classical communication (LOCC) are well understood. A natural question then arises: Can we determine the transformation conditions for mixed entangled states under LOCC based on the properties of their pure-state ensembles? While much effort has been devoted to this issue, in this paper, we rule out this possibility. Our findings address several open questions, including: (i) The conditions \( E_f^{cr}(ρ) \geq E_f^{cr}(σ) \) for all convex roof entanglement measures \(E_f^{cr}\) is insufficient to guarantee the existence of an LOCC transformation \(Λ^L(\cdot)\) from \(ρ\) to \(σ\); and (ii) The inequalities \(\sum_j p_j E(\varphi_j) \geq \sum_l q_l E(ψ_l)\) for all entanglement monotones \(E\) are not sufficient to ensure the existence of an LOCC transformation from \(\{p_j, \ket{\varphi_j}\}\) to \(\{q_l, \ket{ψ_l}\}\).

Abstract: Quantum critical phases are extended regions of phase space characterized by a diverging correlation length. By analogy, we define an information critical phase as an extended region of a mixed state phase diagram where the Markov length, the characteristic length scale governing the decay of the conditional mutual information (CMI), diverges.
  We demonstrate that such a phase arises in decohered $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric codes by assessing both the CMI and the coherent information, the latter quantifying the robustness of the encoded logical qudits. For $N>4$, we find that the system hosts an information critical phase intervening between the decodable and non-decodable phases where the coherent information saturates to a fractional value in the thermodynamic limit, indicating that a finite fraction of logical information is still preserved. We show that the density matrix in this phase can be decomposed into a convex sum of Coulombic pure states, where gapped anyons reorganize into gapless photons. We further consider the ungauged $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and interpret its mixed state phase diagram in the language of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We argue that in the dual model, the information critical phase arises because the spontaneously broken off-diagonal $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ symmetry gets enhanced to a U(1) symmetry, resulting in a novel superfluid phase whose gapless modes involve coherent excitations of both the system and the environment. Finally, we propose an optimal decoding protocol for the corrupted $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ Toric code and evaluate its effectiveness in recovering the fractional logical information preserved in the information critical phase. Our findings identify a gapless analog for mixed-state phases that still acts as a fractional topological quantum memory, thereby extending the conventional paradigm of quantum memory phases.

Abstract: The experimental access to ultra-strong couplings in light-matter interactions has made the quantum phase transition (QPT) in the quantum Rabi model practically relevant, while the physics of the QPT has not yet been fully explored. The polaron picture is a method capable of analyzing in the entire coupling regime and extracting the essential physics behind the QPT. However, the asymmetric deformation of polarons is missing in the current polaron picture. In the present work we propose an improved variational method in asymmetric polaron picture (APP). Our APP not only increases the method accuracy but also reveals more underlying physics concerning the QPT. We find that in the ground state both the polarons and antipolarons are asymmetrically deformed to a large extent, which leads to a richer phase diagram. We also analyze the first excited state in which we unveil an asymmetry direction reversal for the polarons and an attraction/replusion transition differently from the ground state. Finally, we apply the APP in quantum Fisher information analysis and critical coupling extraction, the improvements indicate that the polaron asymmetry makes a considerable contribution to the quantum resource in quantum metrology and plays an unnegligible role in the QPT. Our results and mechanism clarifications expose more subtle energy competitions and abundant physics, and the method potentially might have broader applications in light-matter interactions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate signatures of quantum chaos within Ising spin chains subjected to transverse and longitudinal fields, incorporating both local (nearest-neighbor) and non-local (long-range) couplings. While local Ising models may exhibit integrable or chaotic dynamics contingent on interaction strengths and field parameters, systems with non-local interactions generally display a stronger propensity toward chaos, even when the non-local couplings are weak. By examining the distribution of energy level spacings through the level spacing ratio, we delineate the transition from integrable to chaotic regimes and characterize the emergence of quantum chaos in these systems. Our analysis demonstrates that non-local couplings facilitate faster operator spreading and more intricate dynamical behavior, enabling these systems to approach maximal chaos more readily than their local counterparts. Additionally, we analyze Krylov complexity as a dynamical probe of chaos, observing a characteristic peak followed by a plateau at late times in chaotic regimes. This behavior provides a quantitative means to distinguish between integrable and chaotic phases, with the growth rate and saturation level of the complexity serving as effective indicators. Our findings underscore the role of non-local interactions in accelerating the onset of chaos and modifying dynamical complexity in quantum spin chains.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a framework aiming at designing quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems while providing theoretical guarantees on their approximation ratios. The principal innovative aspect of our work is the construction of a time-dependent Lyapunov function that naturally induces a controlled Schrödinger evolution with a time dependent Hamiltonian for maximizing approximation ratios of algorithms. Because the approximation ratio depends on the optimal solution, which is typically elusive and difficult to ascertain a priori, the second novel component is to construct the upper bound of the optimal solution through the current quantum state. By enforcing the non-decreasing property of this Lyapunov function, we not only derive a class of quantum dynamics that can be simulated by quantum devices but also obtain rigorous bounds on the achievable approximation ratio. As a concrete demonstration, we apply our framework to Max-Cut problem, implementing it as an adaptive variational quantum algorithm based on a Hamiltonian ansatz. This algorithm avoids ansatz and graph structural assumptions and bypasses parameter training through a tunable parameter function integrated with measurement feedback.

Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of a three-level $Λ$-type atom driven by a strong coherent laser and a weak stochastic field exhibiting amplitude and phase fluctuations. The stochastic field is modeled as a complex Gaussian-Markovian random process with finite bandwidth to describe realistic laser noise. Using the Born-Markov and rotating-wave approximations, we derive a Lindblad-form master equation that incorporates spontaneous emission and noise-induced terms, and we solve for the steady-state regime. We examine level populations in both the bare and dressed bases and compute the incoherent resonance-fluorescence spectrum. Our analysis shows that the stochastic drive is not merely a source of decoherence but a versatile control parameter. By detuning the stochastic-field central frequency relative to the coherent drive (especially for narrow bandwidths), we observe pronounced changes in emission characteristics, including selective enhancement or suppression, and reshaping of the multi-peaked fluorescence spectrum when the detuning matches the generalized Rabi frequency. Numerical results reveal nontrivial steady-state modifications distinct from purely coherent driving, enabling precise control of populations and suggesting applications in quantum control, quantum technologies, spectroscopy, and noise-assisted manipulation of atomic systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Wigner function approach to study photon emission in phase space, predicting new Cherenkov radiation effects with attosecond precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of quantum field theory in momentum space for capturing spatial and temporal phenomena in photon emission, especially relevant for attosecond spectroscopy and metrology.

Method: The paper introduces a phase-space description of photon emission using a Wigner function, focusing on spatial and temporal effects like photon spreading time and flash duration.

Result: Predicted effects for Cherenkov radiation include finite photon spreading time, flash duration, and quantum shift of photon arrival time, showcasing atomic origins of macroscopic phenomena.

Conclusion: The proposed method bridges the gap between quantum field theory and spatial-temporal phenomena, offering new insights into photon emission processes and enabling applications in particle physics through quantum optics techniques.

Abstract: Interactions between charged particles and light occur in real space and time, yet quantum field theory usually describes them in momentum space. Whereas this approach is well suited for calculating emission probabilities and cross sections, it is insensitive to spatial and temporal phenomena such as, for instance, radiation formation, quantum coherence, and wave packet spreading. These effects are becoming increasingly important for experiments involving electrons, photons, atoms, and ions, particularly with the advent of attosecond spectroscopy and metrology. Here, we propose a general method for describing the emission of photons in phase space via a Wigner function. Several effects for Cherenkov radiation are predicted, absent in classical realm or in quantum theory in momentum space, such as a finite spreading time of the photon, finite duration of the flash and a quantum shift of the photon arrival time. The photon spreading time turns out to be negative near the Cherenkov angle, the flash duration is defined by the electron packet size, and the temporal shift can be both positive and negative. The characteristic time scales of these effects lie in the atto- and femtosecond ranges, thereby illustrating atomic origins of these macroscopic phenomena. The near-field distribution of the photon field resembles the electron packet shape, thus making ``snapshots'' of the emitter wave function. Our approach can easily be generalized to the other types of radiation and extended to scattering, decay, and annihilation processes, bringing tomographic methods of quantum optics to particle physics.

Motivation: To explore how background media, particularly electrolytes, influence excited-state systems and resonance interactions, highlighting potential implications for biological fluids.

Method: The paper reviews dispersion interactions in electrolytes and analyzes the impact of nonlocal media on atom-atom excited-state systems, predicting a new interaction term.

Result: A new resonance interaction term, proportional to $e^{-κ_{\rm D} ρ}/ρ$, is predicted in nonlocal media. At zero temperature, a $1/ρ^4$ term emerges, while long-range effects are dampened, scaling as $1/ρ^7$.

Conclusion: The study identifies a new contribution to resonance interaction energy in electrolytes, which may play a role in molecular formation in biological fluids, alongside van der Waals forces.

Abstract: We commence our study with review of dispersion interactions in electrolytes. We then reflect on how background media change atom-atom excited-state systems. To highlight the impact of nonlocal media, such as salt solutions, we predict that a new contribution to the resonance interaction energy emerges in a form $\propto e^{-κ_{\rm D} ρ}/ρ$. Here $κ_{\rm D}$ is the Debye length and $ρ$ is the distance between the atoms. This contribution vanishes at zero temperature, where a new term proportional to $1/ρ^4$ (similar to free space) occurs. This new term is dampened by the electrolyte at large distances, causing it to decrease much faster, proportional to $1/ρ^7$. The long-range electrolyte-induced resonance interaction at finite temperature may, in addition to the dominating van der Waals attraction (which goes as $1/ρ^6$), take part in the molecular formation of biological fluids.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the interplay between unitary Hamiltonian dynamics and non-unitary measurement-collapse dynamics in a continuously monitored qubit by drawing analogies to classical physics.

Method: Leverages the equivalence between qubit dynamics under diffusive measurements and the Lorentz group to model unitary and non-unitary dynamics as rotations and boosts of an effective classical charge.

Result: A four-dimensional Bloch ball representation is developed, with unitary dynamics as spatial rotations and non-unitary dynamics as hyperbolic boosts, demonstrating delayed choice effects in stochastic force fields.

Conclusion: The paper generalizes the Bloch ball to four dimensions to visualize a monitored qubit's state as a classical charge influenced by stochastic electromagnetic fields, highlighting delayed choice effects in qubit dynamics.

Abstract: A continuously monitored quantum bit (qubit) exhibits competition between unitary Hamiltonian dynamics and non-unitary measurement-collapse dynamics, which for diffusive measurements form an enlarged transformation group equivalent to the Lorentz group of spacetime. We leverage this equivalence to develop a four-dimensional generalization of the three-dimensional Bloch ball to visualize the state of a monitored qubit as the four-momentum of an effective classical charge affected by a stochastic electromagnetic force field. Unitary qubit dynamics generated by Hermitian Hamiltonians correspond to elliptic spatial rotations of this effective charge while non-unitary qubit dynamics generated by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or stochastic measurement collapse correspond to hyperbolic Lorentz boosts. Notably, to faithfully emulate the stochastic qubit dynamics arising from continuous qubit measurement, the stochastic electromagnetic fields must depend on the velocity of the charge they are acting on. Moreover, continuous qubit measurements admit a dynamical delayed choice effect where a future experimental choice can appear to retroactively determine the type of past measurement backaction, so the corresponding point charge dynamics can also exhibit delayed choice Lorentz transformations in which a future experimental choice determines whether stochastic force fields are electric or magnetic in character long after they interact with the particle.

Motivation: To build a QECC from multiple classical codes and explore new constructions beyond the HGP method.

Method: A general and explicit construction recipe for QECCs from D classical codes, extending the HGP construction.

Result: Recovers HGP for D=2, identifies four distinct constructions for D=3, and unifies various lattice models.

Conclusion: The general construction protocol enriches the structure of QECCs and enables exploration of richer possibilities for good codes.

Abstract: The hypergraph product (HGP) construction of quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) offers a general and explicit method for building a QECC from two classical codes, thereby paving the way for the discovery of good quantum low-density parity-check codes. In this letter, we propose a general and explicit construction recipe for QECCs from a total of D classical codes for arbitrary D. Following this recipe guarantees the obtainment of a QECC within the stabilizer formalism and nearly exhausts all possible constructions. As examples, we demonstrate that our construction recovers the HGP construction when D = 2 and leads to four distinct types of constructions for D = 3, including a previously studied case as one of them. When the input classical codes are repetition codes, our D = 3 constructions unify various three-dimensional lattice models into a single framework, encompassing the three-dimensional toric code model, a fracton model, and two other intriguing models not previously investigated. Among these, two types of constructions exhibit a trade-off between code distance and code dimension for a fixed number of qubits by adjusting the lengths of the different classical codes, and the optimal choice can simultaneously achieve relatively large values for both code distance and code dimension. Our general construction protocol provides another perspective for enriching the structure of QECCs and enables the exploration of richer possibilities for good codes.

Abstract: Not all entangled states can exhibit quantum steering, and determining whether a given entangled state is steerable is a crucial problem in quantum information theory. The main challenge lies in verifying the existence of a local hidden-state (LHS) model capable of reproducing all post-measurement assemblages generated by arbitrary measurements. To address this, we propose a machine learning-based framework that employs batch sampling of measurements and gradient-based optimization to construct an optimal LHS model. We validate our method by analyzing the steerability of two-qubit Werner and two-qutrit isotropic states. For Werner states, our approach saturates the analytical visibility bounds under three Pauli measurements, arbitrary projective measurements (PVMs), and arbitrary positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs). For isotropic states, we achieve the known analytical bounds under arbitrary PVMs. We further investigate the steerability of this class of states under arbitrary POVMs, and our results suggest that POVMs can offer an advantage over PVMs in revealing the steerability of such states.

Abstract: Ergotropy--a key figure of merit for quantum battery (QB) performance--plays a crucial role. However, the dynamics and physical mechanisms governing ergotropy evolution remain open challenges. Here, we investigate the ergotropy of a general QB model and find that the charging process is accompanied by the variation and inversion of the energy level populations. In the absence of population inversion, the ergotropy is fully consistent with coherent ergotropy; in local and global population inversion, it is determined by both coherent and incoherent ergotropy. Via random sampling of quantum states and Hamiltonians, we show that coherence and the participation ratio enhance coherent ergotropy, whereas incoherent ergotropy--whether enhanced, unchanged, or suppressed--depends on diagonal entropy, the participation ratio, and energy level population ordering. We demonstrate that the ergotropy lower bound is incoherent ergotropy, the upper bound is the QB stored energy, and enhanced QB purity suppresses locked energy and boosts charging efficiency. Furthermore, we use the Tavis-Cummings (TC) and Jaynes-Cummings (JC) batteries as paradigms to validate our findings. Our work elucidates ergotropy underlying mechanisms in general QBs and establishes a rigorous framework for optimizing ergotropy and charging efficiency, paving the way for high-performance quantum energy-storage devices.

Abstract: Qudits offer the potential for low-overhead magic state distillation, although previous results for asymptotically good codes have required qudit dimension $q\gg 100$ or code length $\mathcal{N}\gg 100$. These parameters far exceed experimental demonstrations of qudit platforms, and thus motivate the search for better codes. Using a novel lifting procedure, we construct the first family of good triorthogonal codes on the $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}$ alphabet with $m \geq 3$ that lies above the Tsfasman-Vladut-Zink bound. These codes yield a family of asymptotically good quantum codes with transversal CCZ gates, enabling constant space overhead magic state distillation with qudit dimension as small as $q=64$. Further, we identify a promising code with parameters $[[42,14,6]]_{64}$. Finally, we show that a distilled $|{CCZ}\rangle_{2^{2m}}$ can be reduced to a $|{CCZ}\rangle_{2^n}$ state for arbitrary $n$ with a constant-depth Clifford circuit of at most 9 computational basis measurements, 12 single-qudit and 9 two-qudit Clifford gates.

We use measurement outcomes as the input features and entanglement measures as the training labels. Our models predict entanglement without requiring the full state information. This demonstrates the potential of machine learning as an effcient and powerful tool for characterizing quantum entanglement

Abstract: Logical paradoxes and inconsistent information pose deep challenges in epistemology and the philosophy of logic. Classical systems typically handle contradictions only through external checks or by altering the logical framework, as in Tarski's hierarchy or paraconsistent logics. We propose a novel approach: a quantum circuit architecture that intrinsically enforces logical consistency during its unitary evolution. By encoding self-referential or contradictory propositions into a quantum state, the circuit uses interference effects to suppress inconsistent outcomes while preserving coherent ones. We demonstrate this with the Liar Paradox ("This statement is false"), showing that the quantum model naturally stabilizes truth values that would be paradoxical classically. The framework builds on orthomodular quantum logic treating logical propositions as subspace projectors and connects to belief revision and cognitive modeling by providing a physical mechanism for coherence restoration in epistemic states. This work bridges formal logic and quantum computation, suggesting that consistency can be embedded as a structural property of reasoning systems rather than imposed externally.

Motivation: To unify and generalize qLDPC codes using sheaf theory, leveraging mathematical structures to enhance fault-tolerant quantum computing capabilities.

Method: The authors generalize Poincaré duality to sheaf codes using (co)chain complexes, introduce multiplicative structures (cup and cap products), and prove duality relationships. They further apply these to construct transversal gates and analyze their logical actions.

Result: Proven duality relationships, introduced multiplicative structures, and constructed transversal gates. Demonstrated applications in quantum coding, including logical operations and non-Clifford gates.

Conclusion: The work generalizes Poincaré duality to sheaf codes, establishes multiplicative structures, and demonstrates practical applications in quantum computing, including transversal gates and non-Clifford operations. It also bridges sheaf cohomology with quantum coding theory.

Abstract: Quantum LDPC codes have attracted intense interest due to their advantageous properties for realizing efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing. In particular, sheaf codes represent a novel framework that encompasses all well-known good qLDPC codes with profound underlying mathematics. In this work, we generalize Poincaré duality from manifolds to both classical and quantum codes defined via sheaf theory on $t$-dimensional cell complexes. Viewing important code properties including the encoding rate, code distance, local testability soundness, and efficient decoders as parameters of the underlying (co)chain complexes, we rigorously prove a duality relationship between the $i$-th chain and the $(t-i)$-th cochain of sheaf codes.
  We further build multiplicative structures such as cup and cap products on sheaved chain complexes, inspired by the standard notions of multiplicative structures and Poincaré duality on manifolds. This immediately leads to an explicit isomorphism between (co)homology groups of sheaf codes via a cap product. As an application, we obtain transversal disjoint logical $\mathrm{C}Z$ gates with $k_{\mathrm{C}Z}=Θ(n)$ on families of good qLDPC and almost-good quantum locally testable codes. Moreover, we provide multiple new methods to construct transversal circuits composed of $\mathrm{C}\mathrm{C}Z$ gates as well as for higher order controlled-$Z$ that are provably logical operations on the code space. We conjecture that they generate nontrivial logical actions, pointing towards fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates on nearly optimal qLDPC sheaf codes. Mathematically, our results are built on establishing the equivalence between sheaf cohomology in the derived-functor sense, Čech cohomology, and the cohomology of sheaf codes, thereby introducing new mathematical tools into quantum coding theory.

Motivation: To develop a practical quantum-sensing platform for controlled production and real-time monitoring of ultra-short-lived reactive free radicals, leveraging advancements in weak magnetic signal detection.

Method: A double-layered silica modification strategy is used: an inner dense silica layer preserves NV center properties, while an outer porous silica layer adsorbs and stabilizes hydroxyl radicals. Gadolinium (III) catalysts enable light-free hydroxyl radical generation via water splitting.

Result: The platform achieves stable, tunable radical fluxes (100 mM to molar levels) monitored via NV center spin-dependent T1 relaxometry. The method eliminates reliance on external precursors.

Conclusion: The study extends the application of fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) from relaxation sensing to controlled synthesis of reactive free radicals, supporting advancements in quantum sensing systems for intelligent manufacturing.

Abstract: Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) hosting nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers have attracted considerable attention for quantum sensing applications, particularly owing to notable advancements achieved in the field of weak magnetic signal detection in recent years. Here, we report a practical quantum-sensing platform for the controlled production and real-time monitoring of ultra-short-lived reactive free radicals using a double-layered silica modification strategy. An inner dense silica layer preserves the intrinsic properties of NV centers, while an outer porous silica layer facilitates efficient adsorption and stabilization of hydroxyl radicals and their precursor reactants. By doping this mesoporous shell with gadolinium (III) catalysts, we achieve sustained, light-free generation of hydroxyl radicals via catalytic water splitting, eliminating reliance on external precursors. The mechanism underlying this efficient radical generation is discussed in detail. The radical production is monitored in real time and in situ through spin-dependent T1 relaxometry of the NV centers, demonstrating stable and tunable radical fluxes, with concentration tunable across a continuous range from approximately 100 mM to molar levels by adjusting the catalyst condition. This study extends the technical application of nanodiamonds from relaxation sensing to the controlled synthesis of reactive free radicals, thereby providing robust experimental evidence to support the advancement of quantum sensing systems in intelligent manufacturing.

Abstract: Network nonlocality extends Bell nonlocality to settings with multiple independent sources and parties. Certifying it in quantum information processing tasks requires suitable witnesses. However, in contrast to local correlations, the set of network-local correlations is non-convex. This non-convexity makes certifying network nonlocality a highly non-trivial task. Existing approaches involve leveraging network-specific properties, or inflation-based methods whose constraints grow combinatorially in the number of local variables. In this work, we introduce a linear programming witness for network nonlocality built from five classes of linear constraints. These classes are network-agnostic, although the explicit forms of the constraints must be tailored to a specific network's structure. We use the procedure to construct network nonlocality witnesses for a family of ring networks and certify network nonlocality for a concrete example, relying only on observed probabilities and a tunable experimental parameter. Our work advances the search for efficient witnesses to certify network nonlocality across diverse quantum network architectures.

Abstract: Characterizing entanglement, including quantifying and distribution of entanglement, which lies at heart of the quantum resource theory, have been investigated extensively ever since Bennett \etal proposed three seminal measures of entanglement in 1996. Up to now, there are numerous measures of entanglement that have been proposed from different point of view and plenty of monogamy relations have been explored which make the distribution of entanglement became more and more clear. While this is relatively easy in the case of pure states, it is much more intricate for the case of mixed quantum states especially with higher dimension and more particles in the system. We present here an overview of the theory along this line. We outline most of the results in this field historically and focus on the finite-dimensional systems. In particular we emphasize the point of view that (i) which yardsticks haven been applied in quantifying entanglement and its distribution, (ii) what are the substantive characteristics and interrelations of these measures and their monogamy relations mathematically by comparing, and (iii) which concepts should be improved or revised and how they were developed accordingly.

Abstract: We present a scalable, hardware-aware methodology for extending the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to large, realistic Dynamic Portfolio Optimization (DPO) problems. Building on the scaling strategy from our previous work, where we tailored a VQE workflow to both the DPO formulation and the target QPU, we now put forward two significant advances. The first is the implementation of the Ising Sample-based Quantum Configuration Recovery (ISQR) routine, which improves solution quality in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems. The second is the use of the VQE Constrained method to decompose the optimization task, enabling us to handle DPO instances with more variables than the available qubits on current hardware. These advances, which are broadly applicable to other optimization problems, allow us to address a portfolio with a size relevant to the financial industry, consisting of up to 38 assets and covering the full Spanish stock index (IBEX 35). Our results, obtained on a real Quantum Processing Unit (IBM Fez), show that this tailored workflow achieves financial performance on par with classical methods while delivering a broader set of high-quality investment strategies, demonstrating a viable path towards obtaining practical advantage from quantum optimization in real financial applications.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper reviews quantum fluctuation theorems, linking them with linear response theory to uncover new insights into quantum fluctuations and irreversibility, emphasizing their importance for quantum technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap in understanding quantum fluctuation theorems, which remain less explored compared to their classical counterparts.

Method: The review links quantum fluctuation theorems with linear response theory to explore quantum fluctuations and irreversibility in the near-equilibrium regime.

Result: Recent advances highlight the connection between quantum fluctuation theorems and linear response theory, revealing new insights into quantum fluctuations and irreversibility, particularly in dissipated work.

Conclusion: The article concludes that understanding quantum fluctuations is crucial for both theoretical foundations of irreversibility and practical applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: This article traces the development of fluctuation theory and its deep connection to irreversibility, from equilibrium to near-equilibrium, and finally to far-from-equilibrium systems. Classical fluctuation theorems, which capture the statistical behaviour of thermodynamic systems far from equilibrium, are now well established. Their quantum counterparts, however, remain an active area of research. In this review, we highlight recent advances by linking quantum fluctuation theorems with linear response theory, offering new insights into the nature of quantum fluctuations and irreversibility in the near-equilibrium regime. Particular emphasis is placed on dissipated work in quantum systems as a pathway to observing non-classical effects in quantum thermodynamics. Understanding quantum fluctuations is not only essential for clarifying the foundations of irreversibility but also crucial for the development of novel quantum technologies, including quantum computers, sensors, and metrological devices.

Abstract: Quantum nonlocality is an essential nonlocality resource in quantum information. It has been classified into three distinct types: quantum entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and Bell's nonlocality. In 1991, Gisin presented a fundamental theorem on Bell's nonlocality, pointing out all pure entangled states possess Bell's nonloclaity. Many of the core protocols of quantum information science (such as quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, and certain algorithms in quantum computing) rely on entanglement. Gisin's theorem tells us that as long as we successfully prepare a pure entangled state, we then have a Bell-nonlocality resource that can show the non-classical correlations. Such a resource is not ``virtual'' and can be tested and used through Bell-experiments. Similarly, in this work, we present a Gisin-like fundamental theorem on EPR steering, which indicates all rank-2 (and rank-1) entangled states possess EPR steerability. Thus all rank-2 entangled states can be applicable as EPR-steering resources in quantum information.

Abstract: This paper studies the capacity limits for quantum secret sharing (QSS). The goal of a QSS scheme is to distribute a quantum secret among multiple participants, such that only authorized parties can recover it through collaboration, while no information can be obtained without such collaboration. Following the approach of Zou et al. (2015) on classical secret sharing, we introduce an information-theoretic model for the rate analysis of QSS and its relation to compound quantum channels. We establish a regularized characterization for the QSS capacity, and determine the capacity for QSS with dephasing noise.

Abstract: MaxCut is a canonical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem in graph theory with broad applications ranging from physics to bioinformatics. Although variational quantum algorithms offer promising new approaches that may eventually outperform classical schemes, they suffer from resource constraints and trainability issues such as barren plateaus, making large-scale instances intractable on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. In this paper, we propose an enhanced distributed variational quantum eigensolver for large-scale MaxCut problems, which extends our prior distributed variational quantum eigensolver framework by integrating a novel hybrid classical-quantum perturbation strategy, enhances optimization scalability and efficiency. Our algorithm solves weighted MaxCut instances with up to 1000 vertices using only 10 qubits, and numerical results indicate that it consistently outperforms the Goemans-Williamson algorithm. We further employ a warm-start initialization strategy, seeding the algorithm with high-quality solutions from the Goemans-Williamson algorithm, with results confirming that the optimal classical solution can be effectively further improved. The practical utility of the proposed algorithm is further validated through its application to haplotype phasing on genome sequencing data of the human ABCA1 gene, producing high-quality haplotypes that rival those obtained by the Goemans-Williamson algorithm with $10^6$ projections. These results establish the proposed algorithm as a scalable, NISQ-compatible framework for near-term quantum-enhanced large-scale combinatorial optimization.

Abstract: One explanation of the thermalization of an isolated quantum system is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which posits that all energy eigenstates are thermal. Based on this idea, we use dynamical typicality to predict the thermal state of ultracold Rb atoms exchanging energy via long-range dipole-dipole interactions. In a magneto-optical trap, we excite the atoms to the center of a manifold of nearly harmonically spaced clusters of Stark energy levels and then allow them to equilibrate. Comparing the equilibrium state to our thermal prediction across a range of densities, we find that the atoms generally fail to thermalize, though they approach the thermal state at the highest tested density.

Abstract: Informationally complete (IC) measurements are fundamental tools in quantum information processing, yet their physical implementation remains challenging. By the Naimark extension theorem, an IC measurement may be realized by a von Neumann measurement on an extended system after a suitable interaction. In this work, we elaborate on a simple algorithm for realizing Naimark extensions for rank-one Weyl-Heisenberg covariant informationally complete measurements in arbitrary finite dimensions. Exploiting Weyl-Heisenberg covariance, we show that the problem reduces to determining a $d \times d$ unitary from which the full $d^2 \times d^2$ unitary interaction can be constructed. The latter unitary enjoys a block-circulant structure which allows e.g., for an elegant optical implementation. We illustrate the procedure with explicit calculations for qubit, qutrit, and ququart SIC-POVMs. Finally, we show that from another point of view, this method amounts to preparing an ancilla system according to a so-called fiducial state, followed by a generalized Bell-basis measurement on the system and ancilla. These results provide a straightforward framework for implementing informationally complete measurements in the laboratory suitable for both qubit and qudit based systems.
