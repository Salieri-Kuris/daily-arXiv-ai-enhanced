Here, we resolve this ambiguity by identifying a novel \"stripe-type orthorhombic phase\" as the true parent phase of the high-Tc state, whose diffraction signature is the d2 peaks. Through decisive experiments, we demonstrate that this d2 parent phase is not intrinsically superconducting. Instead, superconductivity emerges only after this stripe phase undergoes a subsequent structural distortion, the definitive signature of which is the asymmetric broadening of the d1 main peaks. Our findings establish that the d2 peaks signal the formation of the parent phase, while the broadening of d1 peaks signals the transition into the superconducting state.

Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize).

In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability.

Calculations are presented of the maximal point $q_c(G^{(p,\\ell)}_\\infty)$ at which the locus ${\\cal B}_q$ crosses the real-$q$ axis, as well as several other points at which, depending on $p$ and $\\ell$, the locus ${\\cal B}_q$ crosses this axis. We give explicit results for a variety of $(p,\\ell)$ cases and observe a number of interesting features. Calculations of the ground-state degeneracy of the Potts antiferromagnet at $q_c(G^{(p,\\ell)}_\\infty)$ are presented. This work extends a previous study with R.

In most 2D FET studies, the gate overlaps with the source and drain electrodes, allowing the gate potential to modulate the 2D semiconductor underneath the electrodes and ultimately effect carrier transport at the metal-semiconductor interface - a phenomenon known as contact gating. Here, a symmetric dual-gate structure with independently addressable back and top gates is employed to elucidate the impact of contact gating on a monolayer MoS2 channel. Unlike previous studies of contact gating, this symmetric structure enables quantification of the phenomena through a contact gating factor, revealing a 2x enhancement in on-state performance in long-channel devices. At scaled dimensions (50 nm channel and 30 nm contact length), the influence of contact gating becomes amplified, yielding a 5x increase in on-state performance and a 70% reduction in transfer length when contact gating is present.

However, extending such moir\u00e9 engineering to one-dimensional (1D) vdW systems has remained challenging. Here we report the moir\u00e9-engineered electronic insulating states in a new 1D moir\u00e9 superlattice, by crystallographically aligning an armchair single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) to 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Remarkably, we observe the emergence of pronounced insulating states at charge neutrality point (CNP), full and half moir\u00e9 fillings in lattice-aligned armchair SWNT/hBN heterostructures by low-temperature electrical transport measurements. In strong contrast, armchair SWNT devices without hBN alignment do not show any of these insulating behaviors, providing compelling evidence for the significant 1D moir\u00e9 effect. Our density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding calculations reveal that synergetic nanotube partial flattening and in-plane lattice reconstruction at 1D moir\u00e9 interface expand the most stable AB' stacking regions (carbon on top of boron) and open sizable band gaps at both CNP and full moir\u00e9 fillings at the single-particle level.

This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue.

Here, we explore a different approach to QPF, where the period is obtained from single-qubit quantities $-$ specifically, the set of one-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) $-$ rather than the output bit strings of the entire quantum circuit. Using state-vector simulations, we compute the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit for a generic periodic function.

In addition to increased qubit-connectivity requirements compared to more conventional topological quantum error correcting codes, qLDPC codes remain notoriously hard to compute with. In this work, we introduce a construction to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations on the recently introduced lift-connected surface (LCS) codes (Old et al. 2024). These codes can be implemented in a 3D-local architecture and achieve asymptotic scaling $[[n, \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3}), \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3})]]$. In particular, LCS codes realize favorable instances with small numbers of qubits: For the $[[15,3,3]]$ LCS code, we provide deterministic fault-tolerant (FT) circuits of the logical gate set $\\{\\overline{H}_i, \\overline{H}_i, \\overline{C_i X_j}\\}_{i,j \\in (0,1,2)}$ based on flag qubits. By adding a procedure for FT magic state preparation, we show quantitatively how to realize an FT universal gate set in $d=3$ LCS codes.

In this regime, the ability of quantum processors to scale in size and depth has become a crucial factor shaping their achievable performance. This study investigates how finite scalability influences resource requirements for simulating open-shell catalytic systems using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The analysis compares hardware archetypes distinguished by fidelity or operation speed under two representative scalability models. Finite scalability increases qubit and runtime demands yet leaves overall scaling behavior intact, with high-fidelity architectures requiring lower minimum scalability to solve equally sized problems. These effects are largely independent of the chosen scalability model. Extending this framework, we examine runtime competitiveness across hardware and code configurations, incorporating surface-code and quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)-based fault tolerance under finite scalability. The results identify operating regimes where high-fidelity architectures remain competitive despite slower gate speeds and show that LDPC codes further expand this regime by reducing space-time overhead.

Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \\(A\\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement.

This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory.

We frame these findings in terms of quantum algorithms constructed from Linear Combinations of Unitaries and block encoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76SU(N)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u67092-2\u6563\u5c04\u632f\u5e45\u53ef\u7531\u4e09\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u9053\u6e90\u4e8eZ2\u4ee3\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76SU(N)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0b\u7c92\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u5355\u4f4d\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5757\u7f16\u7801\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790SU(N)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55N\u503c\uff0c\u6240\u67092-2\u6563\u5c04\u632f\u5e45\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u9053\u6e90\u4e8eZ2\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u5f20\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u632f\u5e45\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u548c\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
